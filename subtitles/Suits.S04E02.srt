1
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,172
- Those two things are not
both gonna happen.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,609
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,744
- Jonathan, listen...
- I don't want to hear it.

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,278
Start making us some real money.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,047
- A man like waiter gillie

6
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,049
Isn't gonna listen
to a guy like you,

7
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,351
Offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,553
- Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,190
But I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,159
- All right, I'm in.

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,193
- You're talking
hostile takeover.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,294
- Gillie industries...

13
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,596
- Logan, we have a conflict.

14
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,064
- You're either with me
or against me.

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,433
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

16
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:37,569
- Get moving on drawing up a
tender offer for logan sanders.

17
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,038
- Do you remember
when I told you

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,408
That I once had an affair
with a married man?

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,543
It was him.

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,681
You're up early.

21
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,683
- So are you.

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,552
- Well, I have to be.
You don't.

23
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,723
- I was already awake.
Thinking.

24
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,224
- About last night?
Look, mike, I...

25
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,161
- It's okay.
I'm good.

26
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,763
- You're good with me working
on the takeover with logan?

27
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,465
- Why do you not
seem to believe me?

28
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,100
- Because you weren't good
last night.

29
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,435
- Which was before this morning

30
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:13,205
When I realized that
that's work.

31
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,640
This isn't.

32
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,775
- [exhales deeply]

33
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:20,746
- So as long as we don't let
that affect this...

34
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:25,284
- In that case, let's set
some in-home ground rules.

35
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,186
Obviously, the first...

36
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,354
- Uh, respecting
each other's privacy.

37
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,489
- Exactly.

38
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,191
The left-hand side of the desk
belongs

39
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,525
To the united nation of ross.

40
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,829
- You're not a nation.
- I have a flag.

41
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,497
- [scoffs] fine.

42
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,166
As long as we agree
that any perusal of my phone

43
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,136
Is considered a breach
of my borders.

44
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,506
I thought you liked it
when I breached your borders.

45
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:51,477
- Mm, well, those are
different kind of borders.

46
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,612
In that case,
a breach is allowed.

47
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,116
- Allowed?
- Encouraged.

48
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,719
- Requested.
- Demanded.

49
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,489
- Let's go make you
late for work.

50
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,692
- Mm.

51
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,527
- Jessica, I am telling you.

52
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,395
The s.E.C. Is gonna send
jeff malone after us,

53
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,599
And nobody is better suited
to beat him down than...

54
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,733
You guessed it

55
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,369
Because we all know that

56
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,706
This is better than this,

57
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,575
Which will result in this,

58
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,379
Which will also result in this

59
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,848
And this

60
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,585
And this.

61
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,587
And what do I want in return?

62
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,791
Oh, you know what I want.

63
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,793
You've always known.

64
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,695
And after I win,

65
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,733
You'll not only be willing
to give it to me.

66
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:52,905
You're gonna be begging
to give it to me.

67
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,440
Ha!

68
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,513
- Louis, I have to talk to you.
- B... not now.

69
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,950
Unless you have photoshopped
my head onto a dragon,

70
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,685
Do not interrupt me
while I'm perfecting my pitch.

71
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,320
- Your pitch doesn't need
to be perfect.

72
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,354
It needs to be now.

73
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,622
- Why?
- Malone is here.

74
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,292
- He's here?
- In the lobby.

75
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,560
And jessica just asked
to see you.

76
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,628
- Oh, out of my way.

77
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,897
- Aren't... aren't you going
to bring your easel?

78
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,934
- Oh, I don't need an easel
to kick this sucker's ass.

79
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,239
- Jessica.

80
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:30,642
- Jessica, I got your message,
and I just wanted to...

81
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,511
- Louis, this is jeff malone.

82
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,380
- Yeah, I know who he is.
He's with the s.E.C.

83
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,217
- He was until this morning.

84
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,651
We brought him over
because we have reason

85
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,286
To believe
they'll be coming after us.

86
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,754
- Wait, what?

87
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,523
- Jeff is
our newest senior partner.

88
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:50,229
He's going to be taking on
the s.E.C.

89
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,597
Because you suck.

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,233
And I wanted to introduce him
to you first

91
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,468
Because you're a loser.

92
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,639
Who can get him up to speed
on felton securities.

93
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:06,445
Because you're never
going to be name partner.

94
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,780
And you're both experts
in finance.

95
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,816
- Louis, I'm really looking
forward to working with you

96
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,885
On felton securities.

97
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,523
- Yeah, me too.

98
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,793
- You suck.
You're a loser.

99
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,896
Louis?

100
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,299
Is there something else?

101
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,469
- No.

102
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,870
Nothing.

103
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,786
How long you been
working on that?

104
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,887
- Two hours.

105
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,322
- You know it's called
a brief, right?

106
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,690
- You know
his name's harvey, right?

107
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,659
- You make
a compelling argument.

108
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:58,864
What do you wanna talk about?
- Um...

109
00:04:58,866 --> 00:04:59,931
Logan sanders.

110
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,033
- What about him?

111
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,803
- We sort of dated
a few years ago.

112
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,073
- Wait, hang on.
Define "sort of."

113
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:11,443
- Definitely.
- Define "dated."

114
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,811
- We had an affair
while he was married.

115
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,779
- Holy sh...

116
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,047
- I know.
And I...

117
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,884
Because, rachel, if there's
two things that harvey hates,

118
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,487
It's things being kept from him
and things being kept from him.

119
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,423
- I know.
- Then what am I doing here?

120
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,791
- I don't know how to tell him.

121
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,460
- Quickly, because logan's
gonna be here in an hour.

122
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,663
- And, rach, it's less important
how you tell harvey

123
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,365
Than that you tell harvey.

124
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,034
Go.

125
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,104
- [sighs] okay.

126
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,807

- I was wondering all day
if you would be...

137
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,947
- I can't do this.

138
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,582
- What?
Rachel...

139
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,584
- It's wrong.

140
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,953
- Wrong?
You're the one who kissed me.

141
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,821
- And I was wrong.

142
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,590
- No, you weren't.

143
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,691
My whole life
I've done everything

144
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,428
And all it did
was make me miserable.

145
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,531
Ever since I met you...

146
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't stop thinking about you,
and all I want to do...

147
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,403
- Logan...
logan, if we do this,

148
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,838
Someone's gonna find out
at some point and then what?

149
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,009
- I don't care.

150
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,192
- [whispering] okay.

151
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,694
Harvey, I need to tell you...

152
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,797
- Rachel?

153
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,468
- Logan.

154
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,470
Where's harvey?

155
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,703
- I don't know.
I'm early.

156
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,639
- He doesn't like it
when people...

157
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,643
- What are you doing here?
- I'm harvey's associate.

158
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,445
- You did it.
You went to law school.

159
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,680
- Not exactly.
I'm in law school.

160
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,881
- Rachel, that's great.

161
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,183
I'm really proud of you.

162
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,018
- I'm just gonna come back.

163
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,721
- You came in here to tell him
about us, didn't you?

164
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,223
- How'd you know?

165
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,925
- It's all over your face.

166
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,526
- Logan...
- Please don't tell him.

167
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,995
- I have to tell him.

168
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,466
- Rachel...

169
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,934
Do you know what people think

170
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,002
When a son
takes over his father's company?

171
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,604
- That his father's proud
of him?

172
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,606
- That he didn't earn it.

173
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,775
Which is why I'm not looking
to advertise the fact

174
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,577
That I once had an affair.

175
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,246
- You're not advertising it.
You're disclosing it to counsel.

176
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,815
- Okay, look,
you want the truth?

177
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,551
I'm not proud of the way I was
back then.

178
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:10,255
The way I treated allison,
the way I treated you.

179
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,857
But I'm not that person anymore,

180
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,992
And I don't want people
to think that I am.

181
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,094
- And I understand that,
but I work for harvey,

182
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,964
And I can't keep things from him
that he needs to know.

183
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,565
- He doesn't need to know this.
- Yes, he does.

184
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,834
- Why is that?

185
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,903
- Because I happen to live
with the man on the other side

186
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,840
Of the takeover battle.

187
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,215
- Oh, no.
You need some me time already?

188
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,017
- It's not me time.

189
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,819
It's "I'm gonna kick
your ass" time.

190
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,055
- I think we both know you only
kick ass after eating a hot dog.

191
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,258
- I could be drinking a juice
box and still kick your ass.

192
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,693
- I don't think so,
because I have this.

193
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,129
- Just read it to me.

194
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,266
- "Harvey specter,
you are summoned to"...

195
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,868
- You gotta be kidding me.
You're subpoenaing me?

196
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,037
- Oh, yeah.
I filed a t.R.O.

197
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,572
I'm gonna block
your tender offer.

198
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,773
- Bullsh..., you are.

199
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,241
- Well, we'll see what the judge
has to say.

200
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,943
Oh, right.
You got your hands full.

201
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,678
Here, let me get that for you.
There you go.

202
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,647
Hearing's at 2:00.
I'll see you then.

203
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,115
Oh, harvey, the suit...

204
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,552
It's a little dated for court,
don't you think?

205
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,055
- Did you get everything
settled with hr?

206
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,224
- Yeah.

207
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,193
Corner office.
You really must like me.

208
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,230
- [chuckles]
don't get too excited.

209
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,831
You know, the last two partners
that had this office

210
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,901
- Then it's a good thing
I'm much better than they were.

211
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,703
- You don't even know
who they were.

212
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,171
- That doesn't matter, jessica.
I know who I am.

213
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,641
- Me too...
cocky lawyer in a corner office

214
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,610
Who hasn't done a thing
for me yet.

215
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,146
- Yet.

216
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,348
By the way, I understand it's
tradition for the name partner

217
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,849
To welcome a new partner
with lunch.

218
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,320
- Jeff, when I told you
that our relationship

219
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,755
Is now purely professional,
I was serious.

220
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,358
- Jessica, what's not
purely professional about lunch?

221
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,827
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

222
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,762
- Oh, you're not hearing me.

223
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,165
- Oh, I'm hearing you.
I'm just ignoring you.

224
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,701
But I promise I won't be
ignoring you at lunch.

225
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,669
- Cocky.

226
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,112
- Harvey. Harvey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

227
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,248
- I was actually hoping
that we could talk in my office.

228
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,683
- What's the...
you're early.

229
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,286
- Did you...
- Oh, you two haven't met.

230
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,988
Rachel, logan.
Logan, rachel.

231
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,390
- I guess you didn't.
- Didn't what?

232
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,057
- We actually have met before.

233
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,093
That's why I was trying
to find you.

234
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,961
- To tell me you met our client?
- No.

235
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,098
To tell you that we used to be
in a relationship together.

236
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,302
- You looking
to get back together?

237
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,403
Both: No.

238
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,338
- Then I don't give a sh...
- Good.

239
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,374
Then we can move on to why
you didn't tell me that the guy

240
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,709
On the other side of this fight
used to be your associate.

241
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,645
- I was going to.
- When?

242
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,046
- In 20 minutes, when you were
scheduled to be here.

243
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,381
Unfortunately,
I have to reschedule.

244
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,883
- Why?
- I have court.

245
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:52,984
Mike's alleging
I broke privilege.

246
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,986
- Did you?
- Yes, technically,

247
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,855
When I told you to move up
our timeline.

248
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,423
Now, if you'll excuse me.

249
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,393
- W-wait a minute.
If you... if you broke privilege,

250
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,861
What are you gonna
tell the judge?

251
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,663
- I don't know,
but until I think of something,

252
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,331
I'm going to confuse the sh...
out of everyone I can.

253
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,133
- That doesn't make any sense.

254
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,702
- It makes total sense.
- No, it doesn't, your honor.

255
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,170
- All right, hold on.
Let me get this straight.

256
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,372
You work for him?
- Worked. I was his associate.

257
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,974
- Not the best associate,
your honor.

258
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,075
- Is that relevant?

259
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,812
- Well, it's on there now
whether we want it there or not.

260
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,114
- And all I'm saying is, there's
no attorney-attorney privilege.

261
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,215
- Finally, a fact.

262
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:28,386
I was his client.
- Not the best client either.

263
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,922
- Mr. Specter, shut up.
Now you're his client?

264
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,124
- No, I was his client...
okay.

265
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,993
I was an associate
at pearson specter,

266
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,861
And then I left
to become an investment banker.

267
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,264
I'd dismiss the whole motion,
your honor.

268
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,866
- I said, "shut up."

269
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,268
Are you an attorney
or an investment banker?

270
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,004
- Then what the hell
are you doing in my chambers?

271
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,806
- Acting as my own attorney.

272
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,075
And no matter how much he tries
to confuse the issue, he can't.

273
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,444
I told him I was going
after the same company he was,

274
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,446
And he used that knowledge
to move up his tender offer.

275
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,747
- He waived conflict.

276
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,282
- That doesn't apply
to privilege.

277
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,018
- Bottom line is, he doesn't
have proof of anything.

278
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,922
- Unfortunately,
he can't force me to testify.

279
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:04,924
There's no precedent.

280
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,958
- Fortunately, there is.

281
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,396
So go ahead, ask him
if he did what I'm saying.

282
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,367
- Mr. Specter,
do I need to swear you in?

283
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,269
- Give him the t.R.O.

284
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,340
Not only can't your client make
a tender offer for 60 days,

285
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:27,479
They can't purchase any more
stock until then either.

286
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,751
- I'm telling you,
we need to negotiate with him.

287
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,018
- You mean pay him off?

288
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,324
Every day this drags on, it's
millions out of your pocket.

289
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,493
- Well, from where I'm sitting,
all I can see is a lawyer

290
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,861
Trying to distract me
from the fact

291
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,295
That this whole thing
is his fault.

292
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,797
- If I didn't break privilege,

293
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,798
He might have locked
this whole thing up

294
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,799
Before you knew what hit you.

295
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,434
- Fine.
We'll negotiate.

296
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,071
- No, I'll negotiate.

297
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,006
- No, not without me.

298
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,274
- Do I need to draw you
a picture?

299
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,276
You, mike, rachel.

300
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,779
- Harvey, I appreciate
your concern,

301
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,480
But this is my first deal, so
unless you're gonna pay him off

302
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,851
With your money,
I'm gonna be at that meeting.

303
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,457
- What are you doing?

304
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,793
- I'm writing in my diary.

305
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,561
- Isn't that
what your dictaphone is for?

306
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,230
- No, my dictaphone
is for my singular triumphs,

307
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,933
Like when harvey told me
I was the man,

308
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,570
And my diary is
for my most agonizing defeats,

309
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,406
Such as when jessica just told
me I'll never make name partner.

310
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,810
- Louis, she didn't say that.
- Well, she might as well have.

311
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,512
She just gave malone
the corner office.

312
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,514
- Oh, my god.

313
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,849
- Yeah.

314
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,350
And what's more is
I think I agreed

315
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,052
To give him felton securities.

316
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,855
- Well, un-agree to it.

317
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,056
- I can't.

318
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,991
I shook his hand.
The die is cast.

319
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,059
- God damn it, louis.

320
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,061
You know how this works.

321
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:54,532
Before you know it, you're
on the 38th floor with ted.

322
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,435
- Who's ted?
- Exactly.

323
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,905
- Holy sh...
What did I just do?

324
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,273
- I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

325
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,409
You're gonna stop writing
in that pussy diary,

326
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,544
And you're gonna show jessica
you're the one

327
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:11,416
Who should be sitting
in that corner office.

328
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:16,020
- Ready the dictaphone.
We're gonna need it.

329
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,129
- You have no idea.
- Do I want to have an idea?

330
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,298
- Not unless you want to hear
about how mike ross

331
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Is still causing us trouble.

332
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,635
- Nope.

333
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,538
- You don't care about
logan sanders at all, do you?

334
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,373
- No.

335
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,576
- This isn't
a coincidental encounter, is it?

336
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,478
- No, it is not.

337
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,981
You are having lunch
with jeff malone today.

338
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,349
- Come on, jessica.
You banged him.

339
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,617
The least you could do
is take him to lunch.

340
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,285
- That is not funny.

341
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,454
- Wait a second,
you want me to take him to lunch

342
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,588
Because you banged him.

343
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,458
- Harvey...

344
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,894
I want you to go ahead
and say "banged"

345
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,663
To my face one more time.

346
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,434
- I'm not going to but not
because I'm scared of you.

347
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:07,105
- Whatever lets you sleep
at night, white boy.

348
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,911
- Donna, tell paul porter
he's meeting me for lunch.

349
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,380
When he gets there, tell them
to seat him with jeff malone.

350
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,915
- Who's he not having
lunch with?

351
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,017
- Jessica.
- Oh, done.

352
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,052
- Aren't you gonna ask me why?

353
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,687
- She asked you to go
because she didn't want to.

354
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,956
You're sending porter
because you don't want to,

355
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,358
But you didn't have the balls
to say no to her face.

356
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Is that it?

357
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,961
- The balls are debatable.

358
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:34,565
- Balls are never debatable.

359
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,070
- Ah, hey there.
- Hey.

360
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,972
Louis, listen, I just, um...

361
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,473
I just wanted to say
one more time

362
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,542
How much I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

363
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,678
- Aww, well, I would just like
to say for the first time

364
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,079
That you will not be
working with me,

365
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,214
Because I will not be giving you
my jock,

366
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,216
Let alone my case.

367
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,051
- Yeah.

368
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,519
Okay, I get it.

369
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,721
So you're the guy?

370
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,957
- Yeah, I am the guy.

371
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,459
- No, not that guy, louis.
Definitely not that guy.

372
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,328
You're the guy in every office
who wants to piss

373
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,564
On the new guy, you know,
to mark your territory.

374
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,733
So why don't I just walk you on
down to my office?

375
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,069
I'm gonna let you get your
little piss on in my corner,

376
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,103
And then we can move on.

377
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,471
- Oh, I've moved on.

378
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,340
I've set the deposition
for todd smith tomorrow.

379
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:20,545
It's my job to determine
whether todd smith is guilty.

380
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,613
- And who do you actually think
is better at determining

381
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,483
Whether a guy is guilty
of insider trading, louis?

382
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,318
A career prosecutor
for the s.E.C.

383
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
Or a monkey
in some italian suit?

384
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,655
- [chuckles] a monkey?
- Monkey.

385
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,657
- Well, you're nothing
but a crowing cock.

386
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,525
And the last cock that walked
into my office

387
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,361
Learned what
all the other cocks learned...

388
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,063
That I eat cock for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

389
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,598
- Louis, you're gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow

390
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,070
- No, simply because I'm gonna
tell everyone here in the office

391
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,740
That you said you eat cock for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

392
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:51,542
- Yeah, that's right.
It's goddamn delicious.

393
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,212
Mmm! Mmm, mmm.

394
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,682
[barks]

395
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,484
So what, you think
you can handle todd smith

396
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,085
Better than me?

397
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,122
Well, let's just see.
Let's just see what you got.

398
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,493
- Saw you scheduled a meeting
with mike.

399
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,528
I assume that means you're going
to offer him a deal.

400
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,730
- It could mean I'm going to
offer him a trip to disneyland.

401
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,334
- Of course not, he'd probably
want to wear mouse ears,

402
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,735
And then nobody wins.

403
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,070
You're welcome.

404
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,671
- I didn't thank you.

405
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,807
Since you scheduled the meeting
when I'm at law school,

406
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,509
Which you did to cut me out.

407
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,644
- Did you get your name
on the wall since lunch?

408
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,812
- No.

409
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,214
- Then let's get
something straight.

410
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,815
I didn't set that meeting.
Donna did.

411
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,318
And if I didn't want you there,
I'd just tell you to your face.

412
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,555
So let me tell you now, you're
not going to that meeting.

413
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,557
- Because you think
I can't handle it?

414
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,559
- Because I'm not throwing
gasoline on a pile of matches

415
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,094
Just to see what happens.

416
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,296
Now, if you're done
wasting my time,

417
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,733
You just gave me an idea.

418
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,768
- You're welcome.

419
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,742
- Harvey, what are you
doing here?

420
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,845
I never brought you a gift
when you moved in.

421
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,215
- Still don't see an orchid.
- Flowers die.

422
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,185
I thought I'd bring
something better.

423
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,753
Me...

424
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,489
Across the table from you.

425
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,491
- Where's your client?
- He doesn't need to be here.

426
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,393
This fight started
with you and me.

427
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,128
So let's you and me
settle it right now.

428
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,297
- You mean you don't want him
here because you don't think

429
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,132
Logan sanders and I
can be in the same room.

430
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,800
- I don't think.
I know.

431
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,636
I can sit across the table
from somebody

432
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,871
Who had a history with rachel.

433
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,606
Maybe, but you both
have a brain and a dick,

434
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,241
And if you get in that room
together,

435
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,311
The brains aren't gonna be
leading that conversation.

436
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,213
- Fine, you tell me
that you have the authority

437
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,549
To negotiate a deal,
and I'll negotiate.

438
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,319
But you can't 'cause you don't.

439
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,688
And I'm not gonna agree
to something here today

440
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,857
Just to have logan reject it
tomorrow.

441
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,792
So go home, get some sleep,
and then the three of us

442
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,863
Will do this again
in the morning.

443
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,507
Felton securities is.

444
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,642
And it's my job to find out
if you're telling the truth.

445
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,244
- Bullsh...
It's my job.

446
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,613
- Louis, I'm handling this.
- No, you're not.

447
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,348
If he doesn't stop lying to me,
I'm gonna cut him looser

448
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,783
Than jared's pants
after a subway diet.

449
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,919
- I'm not lying to you.
- You took a tip.

450
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,888
All right, todd, you took a tip,
used it for your client...

451
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,489
- Yes, and now you're trying...

452
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,625
- God damn it, louis!

453
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,793
Listen, if you don't back
the hell off my interrogation,

454
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,896
I'm gonna pick
his scrawny ass up

455
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,864
And use him to beat
the sh... out of you!

456
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,299
- Stop it!

457
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,300
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

458
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,370
You're trying to rattle me.

459
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,671
- Uh-oh.
- What?

460
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,206
- Uh, your vein.

461
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:39,644
- Louis, he's not gonna...
- What? Have a heart attack?

462
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,246
That was exactly my thought
ten seconds before I was slumped

463
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,481
On the courtroom floor.

464
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,882
- Oh, wow,
it's just like jenkins.

465
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,951
- Jenkins?
- No sh..., jenkins too?

466
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,253
- He was sitting
right next to me, hand to god.

467
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,189
And, louis, you should have
seen his wife and kids

468
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:55,226
- Yeah, you have kids, todd?
- Yeah, I have two kids.

469
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,461
- Yeah, well, whether it's
a heart attack or prison time,

470
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,363
If you do not stop lying to us,

471
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,932
They're never going to see
their father again.

472
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,733
Do you understand
what I just said?

473
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,901
You are never going to play
soccer with them...

474
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,637
- Okay.
Okay, I am lying to you.

475
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,372
But please, you gotta help me.

476
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,343
But, t-dog, you gotta be
straight up with your homies

477
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,344
If you want us
to have your back.

478
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,781
- The truth is, I'm germaphobic.

479
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,783
I have to wash my hands
throughout the day.

480
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,385
And they get dry...
I mean really dry...

481
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,754
So I have to put on
a lot of lotion.

482
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,756
And I know
this sounds ridiculous,

483
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,525
But my finger must have slipped
on the keyboard, and I...

484
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,393
I hit the wrong stock.

485
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,696
- You're saying that you didn't
even mean to buy that stock?

486
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,731
- Nope, but then it skyrocketed,

487
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,566
And I wasn't gonna tell
everybody that I only bought it

488
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,668
Because I suffer from dry skin.

489
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,637
Please, you can't cut me loose.

490
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,241
I mean, I-I can't go
to prison.

491
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,510
Unsanitary.

492
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,416
- Not that
it's any of my business,

493
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,651
But it was straight before.

494
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,785
- I know.

495
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,554
- Oh, I get it.

496
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,590
Look less together.
Get underestimated.

497
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,726
[chuckles]

498
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,997
- You gotta wave
your hand slower.

499
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:12,436
If you want soap, you just click
your heels together three times.

500
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,905
- How do you think I'm planning
on getting that dryer to work?

501
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,374
You know, you think you wouldn't
have these problems,

502
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,708
Considering what
you guys charge.

503
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,277
- Oh, no, I don't work here.

504
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,781
- But you, uh...
- I used to.

505
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,983
- You're mike ross.

506
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,390
- And you're logan sanders.

507
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,325
Paper towel?

508
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,695
- Don't mind if I do.

509
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,330
After you.

510
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,532
- Don't mind if I do.
- I see you two have met.

511
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:45,403
And don't underestimate him
because of his tie.

512
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:49,907
- I have always estimated
that tie correctly.

513
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,409
Now, can we talk about business?

514
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,345
- Depends on what
you're proposing.

515
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,546
- That you walk away.

516
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,415
- That doesn't sound
like much of a deal.

517
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,816
- Well, he forgot to add
the part where you walk away

518
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,951
$20 million richer.

519
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,753
- Pure profit.
No risk.

520
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,922
- Win-win.

521
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,925
- [clears throat] all right.

522
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,663
Sounds good.

523
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,865
Guess I just have one question.

524
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,335
What exactly are you going to do
with this company?

525
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,870
- All due respect, I don't see
how that's any of your concern.

526
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,872
- All due respect, you're the
one coming to me with an offer.

527
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,541
So if I say it's my concern,
it is.

528
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,544
- Mike, you're asking about
a competitor's business plan.

529
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,379
- And if he wants
to not be competitors,

530
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,481
Then he needs to answer
my question.

531
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:35,686
I'm gonna do what anyone would
and sell it for parts.

532
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,055
- [chuckles] no deal.

533
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,791
- Okay, mike.

534
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,893
You win.

535
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,930
Let's, uh, make it 30 million.

536
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,365
- You could make it
a billion, logan,

537
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,999
And the answer is still
gonna be the same,

538
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,135
'cause I made a promise
to waiter gillie

539
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,471
That I would fight
to keep his company alive.

540
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,940
And I don't think he's gonna
believe that cutting a deal

541
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,943
To sell his workers out
is keeping that promise.

542
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,478
- I thought you said
he was smart.

543
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,146
- I am, which I why I know
what's going on here.

544
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,682
- What exactly is that?

545
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,518
- No one ever tells you no.

546
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,720
You're used to getting
what you want.

547
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,056
But that's gonna stop right now.

548
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,693
- You're right.
I do always get what I want.

549
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:16,961
I don't see how this time's
gonna be any different.

550
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:20,931
This time you're talking about
something that I care about.

551
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,533
So if you think I'm gonna
step aside and let you do...

552
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,668
- Yeah, I don't care
if you step aside or not.

553
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,037
When I see something I want,
I take it,

554
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,606
And then I do whatever the hell
I want with it.

555
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,575
And what I wanna do with
this company is strip it down,

556
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,643
Flip it over...
- Okay, that's enough.

557
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:37,014
- No, I don't need to
because you know how this ends.

558
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,183
- Yeah, I do, with me
and waiter gillie on one side

559
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,085
And you crying to your daddy
on the other.

560
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,087
- We're done.

561
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,654
- You're right.

562
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,557
We are.

563
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,993
- Listen, the next time I say
"don't come to a meeting,"

564
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,694
Don't come to a meeting.

565
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:51,829
- He came at me
just as hard as...

566
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,030
- I don't give a sh...
what he did.

567
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,032
Now, if you'll excuse me.

568
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,568
- Where are you going?
- To get you this company.

569
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,437
- What are you talking about?
- Weren't you listening?

570
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,907
He just gave up his weak spot.

571
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,477
- Was that true about jenkins?

572
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,212
- I don't even know a jenkins.

573
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,849
But I do know todd's vein
wasn't bulging.

574
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,884
And, louis, you were actually
pretty good in there.

575
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,053
- Yeah, I was.
And so were you.

576
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,555
- So we're in agreement.

577
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,891
- I just meant that
we should stick by todd smith.

578
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,694
- That story was so ridiculous,
it just might be true.

579
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,830
- Great, I'll call felton
and make the recommendation.

580
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,632
- [stammering] well, hold up.
You're gonna do what now?

581
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,501
Call my client?
- Louis.

582
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,636
It may be your client,
but it's still my case.

583
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:36,841
- Okay. Okay, you call.
- Oh, I plan to.

584
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,910
That mr. Slippery fingers
is no longer our problem.

585
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,146
- Just one second ago,
you said you believed him.

586
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,648
- Yeah, I also told you that
his story was so ridiculous

587
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,085
- Well, then it's our job
to make them believe it, louis,

588
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,620
Or this guy could wind up
in prison.

589
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,655
- He is not my concern, jeff.

590
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,158
Felton securities is.

591
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,028
- [mutters]

592
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,935
- Walter gillie knows
what he's doing.

593
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,070
- Yeah, so do I.

594
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,738
He's letting your pension
go unfunded,

595
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,573
So he can hoard $1 billion.

596
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,277
- No, that money is earmarked
for expansion into asia,

597
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,879
And I believe
in waiter's vision.

598
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,982
- You might, but do the workers
you represent?

599
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,150
- You're acting
as if our fund is empty.

600
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,520
- I'm acting
as if it's 40% full.

601
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,055
- And let me guess,
you're gonna fill up the rest.

602
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,225
- Someone else wants to acquire
gillie' company

603
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,094
Before we can make an offer.

604
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,929
If you vote to block it,

605
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:35,599
We will fully fund your pension
the day we take over.

606
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,870
- You're talking about me
selling out my friend.

607
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,606
- I'm talking
about $500 million.

608
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,174
- And why can you fund it
and they can't?

609
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,277
- Well, they can with half
that billion, but they won't.

610
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,113
Because like I said, he's
hoarding it for that pipe dream.

611
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,849
- You're gonna take that billion
for yourselves.

612
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,250
- Half.

613
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,185
The other half goes to you
and your union...

614
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,255
The men waiter gillie
supposedly cares about.

615
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,859
Pete, this is gonna happen
whether it's me or someone else.

616
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,994
And someone else may not
give you the chance to do

617
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,997
What you were elected to do:

618
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,999
Protect your people.

619
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,175
Hey.

620
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:22,346
How'd your meeting
with harvey go today?

621
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,115
- I thought talking about work
was against the rules.

622
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,918
- Mm, talking about work is.
Talking about our day isn't.

623
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,220
I mean, if we can't do that,
then we're letting the case

624
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,991
Come between us, right?

625
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:36,994
- My meeting with harvey
went fine.

626
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,897
- But you didn't take the deal.

627
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:44,835
- Because it wasn't a good deal.

628
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,205
- Fine.

629
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,374
- Okay, what's the matter
with you?

630
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:53,644
- What's the matter is that
I heard what happened.

631
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:56,313
- From him?
- No, from donna.

632
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,015
But it could have been
from any of the 50 people

633
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,149
Who saw the two of you
going at it.

634
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,918
- Rachel...
- Just tell me this.

635
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,187
Did you refuse the deal
because it wasn't good enough

636
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,822
Or because it came from logan?

637
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,123
- You think I didn't take
this deal

638
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,958
Because of your history
with this asshole?

639
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,660
- Well, you did
just call him an asshole.

640
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,695
- He's an asshole because he's
willing to decimate a company

641
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,897
Just to put some money
in his pocket.

642
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,899
Look, I gave my word
to waiter gillie.

643
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,868
That's what I told harvey
and what I told logan

644
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,637
And what I didn't think
I'd have to tell you.

645
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:24,775
- I'm just saying, all of this
could have been over today.

646
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,010
- You think I don't want this
to be over?

647
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,645
I do.

648
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:28,879
But I can't take that deal.

649
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,148
And we said we wouldn't let this
come between us.

650
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,151
So don't.

651
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,188
- Hi, donna.
- Hey, louis.

652
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:45,329
- Oh, well, I just came in
to bring you this and this

653
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:51,235
And all of these.

654
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,404
Those are the last seven
todd smiths you evaluated.

655
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,738
- Donna...
- Seven.

656
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,173
And you didn't cut
one of them loose.

657
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,342
- You heard me and malone.
- I did.

658
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,977
And you're cutting this guy
loose just to spite him.

659
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,447
- Okay, so this has nothing
to do with malone?

660
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,216
- Nothing.

661
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,753
Where'd you get that?

662
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,822
- Come on.
You know where I got it.

663
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,124
Louis...

664
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,262
I know he took your dream.

665
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:22,032
- [scoffs]

666
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,234
I mean, she didn't even
consider me.

667
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,170
Just brings him in,
had me train him,

668
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:30,441
And gives him the corner office.

669
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,443
- Hey, did I ever tell you
about the time that I auditioned

670
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:35,746
For<i> hamlet</i> in college?

671
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:36,980
- Obviously, you played ophelia.

672
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,149
- No, chrissy kiff did.

673
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,918
I was her understudy,

674
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,187
And I was so jealous.

675
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,823
I found myself wishing that
something would happen to her,

676
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,893
That she would get sick
or she would twist an ankle.

677
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:55,365
And then, the day
before we closed...

678
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:59,737
Her father died.

679
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,871
- Donna, that wasn't your fault.

680
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,741
- But I still felt horrible

681
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,143
And ashamed

682
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:11,782
'cause my jealousy had brought
out something really ugly in me.

683
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:16,353
And as you can tell,
I still regret that.

684
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,388
- You know you've never
told me a story

685
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,258
About yourself like that before.

686
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,762
- I've never told anyone
that story before.

687
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:28,098
Louis, I know how badly
you wanted this.

688
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,403
But this is a man's life.

689
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,972
- We won't cut him loose.

690
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:38,242
I'll tell malone.

691
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,845
- I'm proud of you, louis.

692
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,386
- Did you get an offer
to walk away from your takeover?

693
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,554
- I did.

694
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,022
- What was the offer?

695
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,893
- And you turned it down?
What the hell is wrong with you?

696
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,227
- They're gonna rip
the company apart.

697
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,163
- I don't care if they wanna use
waiter gillie' head

698
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,430
As a paperweight.

699
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,431
- You said you wanted
a grand slam.

700
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,900
That offer is a double.

701
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,234
- Well, I'd rather have a double
than nothing.

702
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,235
- Look, I know
what I am doing here.

703
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,172
Because they just
flipped the head of the union.

704
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,107
And without his vote,
we don't have sh...

705
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,975
- What?
- These guys play to win.

706
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,443
They just promised
$1/2-billion donation

707
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:18,982
And unless waiter gillie is
gonna match it, we're done.

708
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,017
Yeah.

709
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,553
That's what I thought.

710
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,555
You get that $30 million,

711
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:28,225
Or you find yourself
another job.

712
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,198
- Donna, did you need something?

713
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,568
- No, but louis does.

714
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,170
He was planning to pitch you
that he take on jeff malone

715
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,039
Before you and harvey
even met him.

716
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,140
- He saw woodall coming
before we did?

717
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:48,078
He was hoping that
that would mean name partner.

718
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,314
- I empathize with that, donna.
I do.

719
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,381
But I have to make decisions

720
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,217
Based on what's best
for the firm.

721
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,518
- And I'm not here
to change your mind,

722
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,353
But maybe if you did
something else for louis...

723
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,521
- Such as?

724
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,356
- Giving him the corner office.

725
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,225
- You mean jeff malone's office?

726
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,927
- He could move to louis'.

727
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,864
- I appreciate
you letting me know about louis,

728
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,165
But I'm not going to do that.

729
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,401
- Because I said so.
Now if you'll excuse me...

730
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,270
- You're sleeping with him.

731
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:17,407
That glow, the morning meetings,
you had harvey take your lunch.

732
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,910
How could I miss it?
I'm losing my edge.

733
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:25,115
- Donna, there is nothing
going on between...

734
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,051
You're not losing your edge.

735
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,188
But I ended my relationship
with jeff malone

736
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,323
The day that I hired him.

737
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:34,658
- And I respect that.

738
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,093
But you said you make decisions

739
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,062
Based on what's best
for the firm.

740
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:44,067
Isn't giving louis his dignity
back good for the firm?

741
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,171
- Hey, I got your message.

742
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,040
Usually when someone
wants to talk business...

743
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,576
- I want to take your offer.

744
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,313
- Mike, that offer's gone.

745
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:58,982
- And what if I told you
I'd take less?

746
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,317
- I'd say I can't give you less.

747
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,919
- Come on, you're the guy
who settles.

748
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,022
I'm telling you I wanna settle.

749
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,924
- You're telling me
you have to settle.

750
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,258
- And I know that
you can get that offer back.

751
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
- It's not my job
to get it back.

752
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,129
And even if it was, you think
he's gonna give you a nickel

753
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,664
After what you said to him?
- What I said to him?

754
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,998
What about what he said to me?

755
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,266
- I don't care what he said
to you.

756
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:21,138
- You didn't do that for me.
You did that for your client.

757
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,640
- What difference does it make?
It was a win-goddamn-win.

758
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:25,575
And you sh... all over it.

759
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,977
- Now I'm saying, I'll take it.

760
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,345
- Yeah, well,
it doesn't work that way.

761
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,047
I'm here as a courtesy.

762
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,082
You're only here
because you lost.

763
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,184
- Harvey, I'm...
- Enough.

764
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,454
That company's fate is sealed.
It always has been.

765
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,324
And the next time you walk away
from the table,

766
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,994
Be prepared to walk away
from the table.

767
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,476
- Hmm.

768
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,610
Wanna pour me one of those?

769
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:04,448
- Help yourself.

770
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,451
- So what's going on
with mike ross?

771
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:08,685
- How do you know I'm thinking
about mike ross?

772
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,520
- Who else would it be?

773
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,090
He got you on the ropes?

774
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,525
- No, I got him.

775
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,461
And he's about to go down.
- How do you know?

776
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,162
- 'Cause the only way
to stay in the game

777
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:23,166
Is to get waiter gillie
to give up his dream.

778
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,002
- And you don't think
he has the stomach

779
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,004
To rip off the arm
to save the body.

780
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,072
- No, he doesn't.

781
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,041
- You don't seem to feel good
about that.

782
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,143
- No, I don't.

783
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,346
- Harvey.

784
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,348
Do you remember when I gave you
the collins case?

785
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,549
- Yeah.

786
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,252
- It was brutal,
what we had to do.

787
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,354
- It was my first taste
of that kind of thing.

788
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,056
- And you loved it.

789
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,257
- What's your point?

790
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,527
- Some people love
the taste of blood.

791
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,563
Other people, hmm.

792
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,600
Better to find out
who you are sooner than later.

793
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,235
- You saying
I'm doing him a favor?

794
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:02,272
- I'm saying,
you're being who you are

795
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,777
And letting him be who he is.

796
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,125
- What are you doing?

797
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,360
- I'm just thinking
about how much

798
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,228
I'm going to miss
having my own office.

799
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,098
- Put your pride away, okay?
You can still go back to harvey.

800
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,366
- I went back to harvey.

801
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:34,171
The money's off the table.

802
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,373
- Then you have to flip
that vote.

803
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,608
- The only way to do that
is to get waiter gillie

804
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,779
To put $500 million
into that pension fund.

805
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,348
And if he does that,
he loses his expansion.

806
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,120
- Amy, when his son died,
this company became his family.

807
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,422
If he doesn't expand, then
his company's gonna die too.

808
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,624
I ask him to do that,
then I'm no better than logan.

809
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,493
- No, you are better,
because after you do this,

810
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,161
You're still gonna fight
to keep them alive.

811
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,629
- Gillie is not gonna see it
that way.

812
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,798
He's just gonna see
some slick banker

813
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,667
Who sold him a bill of goods
just to end up doing

814
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,570
What everybody else
was at least up front about.

815
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,139
- Mm.

816
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,607
Then why don't you
just pack up your sh...

817
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,742
And crawl out of here with
your tail between your legs?

818
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:15,378
Because if you don't have
the stomach to handle this,

819
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,783
Then you don't belong here.

820
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,520
- Hey, uh, got your message.

821
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,888
Is there something wrong
with felton securities?

822
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,890
- Not at all.

823
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:30,193
I just assumed since you wanted
to meet here in malone's office.

824
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,162
- Oh, this isn't his office
anymore.

825
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,530
- Oh, did he get fired?

826
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:36,633
- No, but he is moving.

827
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,769
Louis, I know it hasn't always
been easy for you

828
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,372
To embrace new partners,

829
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,342
But you've made
a great effort with jeff.

830
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,244
- [laughs] all in a day's work.

831
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,747
- And your day's work has
benefited this firm for years.

832
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,682
So we thought it was time
to show you

833
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,685
A little overdue appreciation.

834
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,164
- [chuckles] this office?

835
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:15,539
Because I wanted him
to feel valued here.

836
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,343
But the truth is, I...
I should have given it to you.

837
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,479
- [stammers]

838
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,548
- [groans]

839
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,884
- I don't know what to say.

840
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,453
- Oh, okay.

841
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,956
All right, let it out.
- [sobbing]

842
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,859
Pete kreeling would never side
with them.

843
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,527
- He would, and he has,

844
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,895
Because they offered
what you couldn't...

845
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,564
Security for his workers.

846
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,600
- Then show them
that you care about them.

847
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,769
Fund the pension,
and fund it now.

848
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,404
- You told me you'd fight
to keep this from happening.

849
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,372
- I told you I would fight
to protect your company.

850
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,408
And right now, this is
the best way of doing that.

851
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,944
- You're talking
about using my expansion money.

852
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:54,978
- If you don't use it now,

853
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,813
There's gonna be
nothing to expand.

854
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,249
- You son of a bitch,
you manipulated me.

855
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,383
- No, I told you
a war was coming

856
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,818
And that you needed a war chest.

857
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,553
Well, now is the time
to crack it open.

858
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,224
- You told me what I wanted
to hear to get me on your side.

859
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:10,427
I looked you in the eye,
and I told you that I wanted

860
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,861
To save your company.

861
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,364
And told me they wanted
to rip it apart.

862
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:15,799
- You're the same as them!

863
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,867
- And you're an naive old man
having a tantrum

864
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,738
Because he's not getting
his way!

865
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,521
- That expansion was my dream.

866
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,724
- I know.

867
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,900
But now it's time to wake up.

868
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:54,404
Fund the pension, waiter.

869
00:37:54,406 --> 00:38:00,277
Pete kreeling's vote
stays in our favor, and...

870
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,879
We live to fight another day.

871
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:15,358
- I just wanted to thank you,
you know, for the new office.

872
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,393
- It's a downgrade.

873
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,994
- Not to me.

874
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,863
I also wanted to thank you
for lunch.

875
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,765
- I didn't show up for lunch.
- I know.

876
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,600
You thought you were
sending me a message.

877
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:24,868
- I was sending you a message.

878
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,903
- Not the one you wanted,
jessica.

879
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,405
You see,
because what I heard is that

880
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,408
You don't trust yourself
around me.

881
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,943
- If I didn't,

882
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,679
I wouldn't have put you
right next door.

883
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,048
- Jessica, say what you will,

884
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,849
But we both know
where this is headed...

885
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,786
You and me watching these.

886
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:45,388
- You think you know me
that well?

887
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,923
- Well, if I don't,

888
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:50,794
I'm about to.

889
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,862
Neighbor.

890
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,938
- More. More. More.
Ah, ah.

891
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,507
Thank you.

892
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,650
- Happy corner office.

893
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,586
Open it.

894
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,789
- Is this...
- Me.

895
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,059
As ophelia.

896
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,494
- But I thought you...

897
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,397
- Yeah, well,

898
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:31,134
Sometimes bitter memories

899
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:35,004
Become bittersweet

900
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,074
When you share them
with a friend.

901
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,546
- You here to pick up rachel?
- No.

902
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,449
No, I just came by
to say thanks.

903
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,650
- For what?

904
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:25,422
- For not giving me a way out.

905
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,424
- You funded the pension.

906
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,559
- 100%.

907
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,661
- You just got rid
of half your war chest.

908
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:36,499
- Maybe, but I also did
what you thought I couldn't do.

909
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,836
I got the vote back.

910
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,641
Maybe now you'll realize that
I'm willing to go the distance.

911
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:45,775
- All you did was make it
to round two.

912
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,813
This was gonna be like
one of those early tyson fights,

913
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:53,716
The ones that only lasted
45 seconds.

914
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:54,784
Remember what happened
the first time

915
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,820
Someone made it
out of round one?

916
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:59,856
- And what ever did happen
to buster douglas?

917
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,091
- I don't know,
but wherever he is,

918
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,195
They can't take that title away
from him.

919
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,806
Hey.

920
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,842
- Hey.

921
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,844
- What you working on?

922
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,680
- You know what I'm working on.

923
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:24,914
- You wanna go home?

924
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:28,718
[cell phone vibrates]

925
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,087
Harvey.

926
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,624
Guess that means you're
gonna be working late, huh?

927
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,494
- Um...

928
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,598
Thanks to the guy
we're up against.

929
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,735
He is proving to be much tougher
than everyone expected.

930
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,605
- Everyone?
- Not everyone.

931
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,979
- He sounds like
a real douche bag.

932
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:59,949
- [laughs]

933
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:04,053
You know, he's not that tough.

934
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,523
I can work on this tomorrow.

935
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,559
Let's get out of here.

936
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,101
- You really gonna
work on that tomorrow?

937
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,969
- No, I'm going to work on it
later tonight,

938
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,239
But at least I'll be home.

939
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,841
- Think I can take a look at it
when you're done?

940
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:25,843
- I think not.

941
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,176
- Just a proofread?

942
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,045
- Ah, still no.
