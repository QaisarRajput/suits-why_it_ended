1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,737
- You're good with me working
on the takeover with logan.

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:08,207
- As long as we don't let that
affect this.

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,742
- We won't.

4
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,377
- I do always get what I want,

5
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:14,146
And what I want to do with
this company is strip it down,

6
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,347
Flip it over, and then...

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,715
- That's enough.
We're done.

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,150
- You're right.

9
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,120
- When I told you that
our relationship was now

10
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,688
Purely professional,
I was serious.

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,723
- What's not purely professional
about lunch?

12
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,159
Unless you mean the sex
that'll be following lunch.

13
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,762
- Phillip, your son,
you lost him,

14
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,731
And that's what this company
is to you now, your family.

15
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,367
I lost both my parents
when I was 11 years old,

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,070
So I know a little something
about needing family.

17
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,772
- Since when does the s.E.C.
Go around

18
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,608
Intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,576
- They don't,
but they will when eric woodall

20
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,679
Starts there next week.

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,619
- [yawns]

22
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,321
[sighs]

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,656
- Another all-nighter?

24
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,491
- Yeah.

25
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,726
- Work or school?

26
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,728
- Work.

27
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,229
- What were you working on?

28
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,198
- You know what I was
working on.

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,067
I am so sorry, but I'm so tired.

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,202
I have to go get some sleep
before I go back to the office.

31
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,203
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

32
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,571
I haven't seen you in two days.

33
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,206
Give me five minutes.

34
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,342
- Okay,
but I can't be responsible

35
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,144
For anything that I say.

36
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,080
- Well, okay, in that case,

37
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,082
Is logan going
after another board member?

38
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,116
- Nice try.

39
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,384
- Mm, is he running out of cash?

40
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,086
- I can't tell you that.

41
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,422
- Did you love him?

42
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,459
- How long have you been waiting
to ask me that?

43
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,561
- You know, just when you were
at your weakest

44
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,498
And most vulnerable.

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,402
- I did love him,
but I don't love him now.

46
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,105
I love you.

47
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,740
- Who ended it?

48
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,643
- Does that matter?
- It does to me.

49
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,215
- I ended it.

50
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,850
Now, do you have
any other burning questions,

51
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,719
Or can I go to sleep, please?

52
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,488
- Um, let me see.

53
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,890
What's the most expensive thing
you ever shoplifted?

54
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,625
Were you a mean girl?

55
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,760
Are you interested in taking
a pole dancing class?

56
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,296
You know what?
We'll get into that later.

57
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,133
Sweet dreams.

58
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,135
- God, enough about you.

59
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,668
I want to talk about me.

60
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,237
- We were just talking
about you.

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,672
- Not enough.

62
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,608
All right, fine.
Let's talk about harvey.

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,576
- Mm.
- So guess what he's been up to.

64
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:29,815
- He found the master tapes
for his father's solo album.

65
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,351
He's working on buying them.

66
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,387
He's been trying to find them
ever since he lost his father.

67
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,891
- Oh, I see why
you're telling me this.

68
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:43,762
Because you're afraid of what
this fight is gonna do to us.

69
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,265
- I'm afraid because of what
it's already doing to you.

70
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,766
I'm talking ali-frazier.

71
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:48,834
- Come on, donna.

72
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,769
- Listen to me.

73
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,304
They started out like brothers.

74
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,939
Then they went toe-to-toe
three times,

75
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,376
And joe frazier went to
his grave hating muhammad ali.

76
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,678
- I didn't know
you were a boxing fan.

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,747
- I'm a harvey fan.

78
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,784
- So am I, and that's why
I'm giving him my best.

79
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,323
Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

80
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,595
[knocking]

81
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,763
- You're in late.

82
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,231
- I was up late.

83
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,200
- Working on my stuff?

84
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,769
- Working on a lot of stuff.

85
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,771
What can I help you with?

86
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,805
- I wanted to talk to you.

87
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,807
- About?

88
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,910
- Well, when I told you before
that I'm not the same guy

89
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,379
That I used to be,
what I meant was,

90
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,482
I got caught up in emotion
back then.

91
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,585
I'm not caught up
in emotion anymore.

92
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,786
- And?

93
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,522
- And that means
that I'm gonna have to do

94
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,390
Some calculated things,

95
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,259
And I needed to know
that you're okay with that.

96
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,928
- Why wouldn't I be?

97
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,496
- You know why.

98
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,898
- Logan,
you don't have to come and have

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,499
These little check-in talks
with me.

100
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,935
I am a big girl, and I know how
these things work.

101
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:01,707
So just do what you have to do,
and stop worrying about me.

102
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,310
- Great.

103
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,516
Harvey,
what the hell's going on?

104
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,619
- At the moment,
I'm 18 minutes away

105
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,555
From owning steve mcqueen's
shelby cobra.

106
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,823
- You know what
I'm talking about.

107
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,658
Last time I saw you,
you told me you were gonna

108
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,428
I just found out waiter gillie
funded his pension.

109
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,264
- Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

110
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,665
- I expected them to fight.

111
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,533
Right now,
we're getting our ass kicked.

112
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,402
- Well, what scorecard
are you looking at,

113
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,904
Because we just got them
to give up half their war chest

114
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,907
- I don't give a sh...
what the scorecard says.

115
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,042
I want a knockout.

116
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,477
- Well, it doesn't work
that way.

117
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,511
- It can if you hit them
below the belt.

118
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,848
When my father went up
against carl icahn,

119
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,716
He said that you waited
till he wasn't looking,

120
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,419
You walked up behind him,
and you shot him in the back.

121
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,788
- Walter gillie
isn't carl icahn.

122
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,923
- I'm not talking
about waiter gillie.

123
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,825
I'm talking about mike ross.

124
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,527
- I don't care
who you're talking about.

125
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,796
That icahn deal
was completely different.

126
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,566
- The only difference I see
is that this deal

127
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,535
Is against your surrogate son.

128
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:08,774
So are you willing to do this
or not?

129
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,576
- You want below the belt?

130
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,079
I'll give you below the belt.

- Louis, we talked about this.

141
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,692
- It's just so weird to see him
in my old office, you know?

142
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,462
It's like when you drive
by the house you grew up in,

143
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:04,930
And there's another family
in there,

144
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,665
And all you want to do is
break in and make yourself soup.

145
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,933
You know that feeling?

146
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,067
- Well, it depends on the soup.

147
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,403
- [scoffs] mushroom barley.
- Then no.

148
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,904
Hey, did you get him
that apology gift

149
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,841
- Except instead of scotch,
I got us two front-row tickets

150
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,542
To the ballet.

151
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,910
- Oh.

152
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,813
Well,
it's the thought that counts.

153
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,982
- Louis, can I help you
with something?

154
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:29,054
You and me,
we got off on the wrong foot.

155
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,125
Words were said,
hurtful caricatures were drawn,

156
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,726
And I did some bad things too.

157
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,561
- Water under the bridge, louis.

158
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:42,167
See, um, I once was told
that actions have consequences,

159
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,904
And I want to turn things around
by inviting you...

160
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,642
To the american ballet company's
production of<i> giselle.</i>

161
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,544
- The ballet?

162
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,013
- Yeah, you and me tonight.

163
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,083
Louis, I would love to go
to the ballet with you.

164
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,520
I really would, but I have
knicks tickets tonight, man,

165
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,923
- All right, I'm gonna let it go
that you're choosing basketball

166
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,826
Over<i> giselle,</i> but I really need
to make this up to you, jeff.

167
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,927
I can't be in the red.

168
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,696
I am always,
always in the black,

169
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:16,802
- Well, now that you mention it,
I could really use some advice.

170
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,838
- About a case?

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,573
- About jessica.

172
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,809
I just pulled adam grieves
as opposing counsel.

173
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,577
And long story short,
he hates me,

174
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,979
And I could really use jessica's
help to run some interference,

175
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,183
But I'm the new guy,
it's only my second case,

176
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,885
And I don't know what to do.

177
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,520
- Well, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

178
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,622
I'm gonna get you
front-row tickets

179
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,058
To jessica pearson's help.

180
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,564
- Okay, harvey, you didn't
bring me here to make me

181
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,098
Choke down
these brussels sprouts.

182
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,201
- No, I didn't,
but you are going to have

183
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,470
To choke down something else.

184
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,071
- Let me guess.
This is about waiter gillie.

185
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,573
- No, it's not about waiter.

186
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,107
It's about the line of credit

187
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,542
That you're about to stop
giving him.

188
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,244
- And why on earth
would I do that?

189
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,713
- Because if you don't,
I have a feeling

190
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,548
That every
pearson specter client

191
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,617
That you currently
do business with,

192
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,953
Suddenly gonna move
their accounts to chase.

193
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,222
- You really want to cripple
his company that badly?

194
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,823
- His company's already dead.

195
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,026
- That doesn't give you
the right to threaten me.

196
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,729
- If I were threatening you,
I'd come right out and say it.

197
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,931
If you don't do this,
tomorrow morning,

198
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,068
You lose $2 billion
worth of deposits.

199
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,669
- You son of a bitch.

200
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,037
- That he is.

201
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,240
- What are you doing here, mike?
- What do you mean?

202
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,575
I just came
for the brussels sprouts.

203
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,244
You know how I know
how good they are?

204
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,913
- Because this is where harvey
brings bankers

205
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,748
To strong-arm them
into doing some bullsh...

206
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,717
- Don't listen to him.
- No, he should listen to me.

207
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm waiter gillie' partner,
and if he cuts off our funding

208
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,055
At any point in the next two
months following this lunch,

209
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,024
Then the next time
you're talking about

210
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,027
These brussels sprouts will be
in front of a grand jury.

211
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,832
Oh, vernon,
don't take it personally.

212
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,567
He did the same thing
to the guy from leeds

213
00:08:55,569 --> 00:09:00,305
At the exact same table
seven months ago.

214
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,283
- Louis, I got your memo,

215
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,552
And if you want to get
an antique diving bell

216
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,855
For your new office,
it's on your dime.

217
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,057
- Okay, that's bullsh...,
but whatever.

218
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,625
I'm here about jeff malone.

219
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,296
You two are gonna have to work
your sh... out on the playground.

220
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,997
- But you see, that's just it.

221
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,699
We already did.

222
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,001
- Something's not right.

223
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,705
- I'm here because you need
to run interference.

224
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,674
- I thought you just said
you worked it out.

225
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,976
- No, not with me,
with adam grieves at the s.E.C.

226
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,678
He has it in for malone.

227
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
- Louis, I'm glad you two
are going to be

228
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,249
Walking to school together
from now on,

229
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,019
But I hired jeff malone
to handle the s.E.C.,

230
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:52,924
Not to get me to handle them
for him.

231
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,027
- You know, you're always
telling me not to make enemies,

232
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,364
And for the first time
since harvey,

233
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,232
I have just made a new friend,

234
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:05,203
So I'm asking you...

235
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,640
Please do it for my friend.

236
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:13,278
- If you won't do it for him,
please do it for me.

237
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,183
- I just had a very interesting
chat with louis litt.

238
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,619
- Louis is
a very interesting guy.

239
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,320
Did you know he's never eaten
an olive?

240
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,090
- I did not, but I do know
you fed him some bullsh...

241
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,725
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Really?

242
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,259
'Cause he thinks we need
to work together

243
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,629
Because there's bad blood
between you and adam grieves.

244
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,863
- I don't like to talk about it.

245
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,331
- Of course not,
because you and adam grieves

246
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,734
Play basketball every Wednesday.

247
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,069
- What happens on the court,
jessica, stays on the court.

248
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,973
- And I thought I was clear
about boundaries.

249
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,341
- Well, listen,
if that's really how you feel,

250
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,343
Why don't you just tell louis
that you want to bow out

251
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:49,247
Because you don't trust yourself
around me?

252
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,150
Yeah, I didn't think so.

253
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:57,055
See you tomorrow.

254
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,359
- What happened to going
below the belt?

255
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:05,263
The referee stepped in and threw
a grand jury at my face.

256
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,731
- Well, I wasn't asking you
to go below the belt

257
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,001
I was asking you to go
below the belt with ross.

258
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,236
- What are you talking about?

259
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,071
- I'm saying you hire
a private investigator

260
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,806
To find every skeleton
in his closet.

261
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,042
He wakes up in the morning, and
it's all over the front page.

262
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,743
- Logan, that's not going
below the belt.

263
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,844
That's just nuts.

264
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,279
- You're full of sh...

265
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,214
You don't want to do this,
because you don't have

266
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,749
The stomach to do it
to your boy.

267
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,451
- No, I don't want to do it,
because we're on a path

268
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,020
To win this thing,
and I let you bait me into doing

269
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,889
What I already did
because I thought you were

270
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,457
Just a little impatient.

271
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,293
But now I'm starting to realize
what it really is.

272
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,295
- What is that?

273
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,130
- Who's full of sh... now?

274
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,099
- This has nothing to do
with rachel.

275
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,935
- You got there
pretty damn fast.

276
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,105
- Hey, I asked you to put
mike ross down with one punch.

277
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,774
You said you would,
and you didn't.

278
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,445
So either do what I'm asking,
or I'll do it myself.

279
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,858
- You can't do it, harvey.

280
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,059
- Yes, I can.

281
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,427
Logan's gonna do it anyway.

282
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,895
At least this way it'll be me.

283
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,731
- What's the difference
if you hire somebody

284
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,499
To look into mike or logan does?

285
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,735
You know damn well they're gonna
uncover his secret.

286
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,470
- I don't know that,
and you don't either.

287
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,139
- Yeah, I do.
- No one's ever found it before.

288
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,941
- Because you were hiding it
from people

289
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,243
Who weren't looking for it,
not from people who are.

290
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,914
- What do you want from me,
donna?

291
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,016
- I want you to get mike
to give up.

292
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,284
- Well, I'm not gonna do that,

293
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,019
Because I know
he's not gonna give up.

294
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,388
- How do you know that?
- Because I know.

295
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,890
- This is mike
we're talking about.

296
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,425
- If it were anyone
other than mike,

297
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,761
I'd have an article
in the journal tomorrow.

298
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,295
- That's not what
you told logan.

299
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,031
- Because I goddamn lied
to logan, and it didn't work.

300
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,135
Now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

301
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,271
- Well, the least you can do
is warn him.

302
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,439
- He's on the other side.

303
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,774
I'm not gonna warn him.

304
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,376
That's not how it works.

305
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,413
- Well, maybe you should think
of something

306
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,482
That won't ruin
his goddamn life.

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,994
You ready to get down
to business?

308
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,031
I was thinking that maybe we
could do all this over lunch.

309
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,299
- It's 10:30.

310
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,034
- There's a lot to discuss,

Jeff and I have two different

- Exactly, go for the knockout
punch or bore them to death.

- Oh, well,
when you frame it that way...

that old debate team trick.

Jessica, what debate team trick?

00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,487
- Calling my approach
"bore them to death"

And yours "a knockout punch."

This farm boy's gonna come down

But I think we all pretty much
know he's playing on my team.

You are right, and in fact,

I think that,
because you and louis

See eye to eye on this case,
that you should work together,

Now that we've firmly

00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,319
- Oh, and one more thing.

466
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,721
Louis thinks malone
is in love with him.

467
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,590
Your secret's safe.

468
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,994
And you're welcome.

469
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,432
- Hey, louis,
do you have a minute?

470
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,867
- Well, it's about all I have,
'cause I'm super, super busy.

471
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,703
- Yeah, well, listen,
I just wanted to check in

472
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,671
And see if you're ready
to pull an all-nighter.

473
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,240
I just got
all the brokerage tapes in,

474
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,808
And I figure we could just
grind it out.

475
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,011
- Tonight,
unless you want to go right now

476
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,446
And just pound it out
all at once.

477
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,647
- Okay, that's it.

478
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,982
I mean,
you have got this all wrong.

479
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:55,786
Jeff,
I like you... As a friend.

480
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,989
- Right, louis.

481
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,291
I like you too.

482
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,892
I think I've made that
perfectly clear.

483
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,795
- Too clear, man, too clear.

484
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,530
I mean, enough
with the come-ons, already.

485
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,965
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, I get it.

486
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,334
You know, we're a perfect match,
you know,

487
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,769
If you go that way,
ebony and ivory.

488
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,639
But I play
a different instrument, so...

489
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,407
- Oh, louis, no...

490
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,276
- Look, I...
look, it's just that...

491
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,011
I just don't...
I don't want there to be,

492
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,780
You know, just awkwardness,
especially since jessica

493
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,849
Just bowed out,
and it's just me and you now.

494
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,550
- Right.

495
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,053
[sighs]

496
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:32,657
Well, now that you've seen
right through me, louis,

497
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:37,061
I...I am disappointed.

498
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,330
- Are you gonna be okay?

499
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,866
- To be honest, I'm feeling
a little raw right now.

500
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,068
- Oh, sh...

501
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,836
[sighs]

502
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,538
I'm sorry.

503
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,073
- Maybe it's best
if you just told jessica

504
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,675
That she needs to step back in.

505
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,010
- Yes.
- Yeah.

506
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,079
- Can do, yeah.

507
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,050
- Get up.

508
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,651
- You here to fight me?

509
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,952
- Oh, should I wait for you
to turn your back?

510
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,690
- I'm sorry, were you
expecting me to give you a call?

511
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,725
- No, I was expecting you to be
a human being.

512
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:10,027
- From where I'm sitting,
I was a goddamn saint.

513
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,629
- Oh, yeah?
How's that?

514
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,364
- If I didn't do what I did,
logan was gonna hire

515
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,334
A private investigator to
smear you up and down the block.

516
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,069
- So what?
- You know what.

517
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,939
I shot you in the knees, so he
wouldn't shoot you in the face.

518
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,407
You're welcome.
- You know what, harvey?

519
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,775
I'm gonna take pass
on the thank-you

520
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,976
And instead skip right
to the part where I call you

521
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,078
A piece of sh...

522
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,947
I'm getting a little tired
of hearing that.

523
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,982
And what does that make you
for threatening to bring

524
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,617
Criminal charges
in that restaurant?

525
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,952
- You deserved criminal charges

526
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,721
For what you were doing
in that restaurant.

527
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,089
- You didn't have a problem
when we did it

528
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:42,526
- Seven months ago, you weren't
lying to somebody about me.

529
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,428
- I didn't lie,
and seven months ago,

530
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,565
You were goddamn here.

531
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,000
- So that's what this is about.

532
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,802
You can't stand
that I got out of here

533
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,637
And that I'm succeeding
without you.

534
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,006
- Without me?

535
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,842
I made you.

536
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,643
Without me, you're nothing.

537
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,712
- Right there.

538
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,048
That's who you are,
and that's why I left.

539
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,384
- Bullsh...
Don't lay that on me.

540
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,986
You left because you needed
to feed that huge ego.

541
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,589
- Ego?
Ego?

542
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,691
If I stayed here, you know what
would have been hanging

543
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,693
Over my head for the rest
of my life.

544
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,762
- Which is why I told you
to move somewhere

545
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:18,963
Nobody ever knew you.

546
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,966
But you stayed here,
so that thing is still

547
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,435
Over your goddamn head,
and I stopped it.

548
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,771
- I don't care what you think
you stopped.

549
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,072
You're gonna go
to waiter gillie,

550
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,874
And you're gonna make
this thing right.

551
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:30,908
- It is right.

552
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,410
It's over.
You lost.

553
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,178
- Nothing's over.

554
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,046
And you're the one who lost
something today.

555
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,581
- What are you talking about?

556
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,017
- You went personal.
I went personal.

557
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,788
Your father's master tapes...
I've got 'em.

558
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,660
- Those tapes have nothing to do
with this deal.

559
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,931
- They do now.

560
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,840
- Harvey...

561
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:03,842
I did this.

562
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,843
- What?
- The tapes.

563
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,612
Mike found out about them
from me.

564
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,681
I've been meeting him for coffee
just because I wanted

565
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,750
To make sure that everything
was okay between the two of you,

566
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,086
And I never, ever thought that
he would do something like this.

567
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,622
I'm so, so sorry.

568
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,560
- It's not your fault, donna.

569
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,462
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

570
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,030
The tapes have nothing to do
with this deal.

571
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:29,967
The second I believe they do,
I'm done.

572
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,236
- Ugh, perfect timing.

573
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,604
Do you want me
to get rid of him?

574
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,106
- I'll handle it.

575
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,177
- What part of
"drag mike ross through the mud"

576
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,846
Did you not understand?

577
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,814
- The part where you come off
looking like a rich,

578
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,982
Vindictive douche bag.

579
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:49,253
- Based on your years
of experience in takeovers?

580
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,555
Here's something they didn't
teach you in snowboarding school

581
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,656
Or wherever the hell you went

582
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,625
Before you decided to be
a grown-up.

583
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,861
Never destroy anyone in public

584
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,263
When you can accomplish
the same result in private.

585
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,764
- Meaning?

586
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,733
- I severed mike's ties
with waiter gillie.

587
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,235
It's over.

588
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,270
- You know, you told me
that mike ross wasn't a threat,

589
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,972
And then he handcuffed us
with a t.R.O.

590
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,074
You said that you'd
take him down with one blow,

591
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:14,845
So here's something that I did
learn in snowboarding school.

592
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,748
When someone talks sh...,
I demand proof.

593
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,983
- Proof of what?

594
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,285
Logan, we won.
You don't need...

595
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,720
- Need to what?

596
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,256
Come off like a rich,
vindictive douche bag?

597
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:27,858
I want proof
that he's giving up his bid,

598
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,193
And if I don't get it
by the morning,

599
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,928
I'm gonna call
my private investigators,

600
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,532
And I'm gonna finish
what I started.

601
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,011
- Where are you going?

602
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:50,180
To get mike to sign an agreement
to give up his bid.

603
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,682
- You can't.

604
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,684
- Why not?

605
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:53,685
- Because you were right.

606
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,586
He's never gonna listen to you.

607
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,922
- Donna, I know you're feeling
bad about the tapes, but...

608
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,156
- That has nothing to do
with it.

609
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,791
- Then what are you saying?

610
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:03,594
- I feel guilty that I told him,
but what he did,

611
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,596
That's on you.

612
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,131
And the reason he's not gonna
listen to you

613
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,766
Is because you acted like
an asshole.

614
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,100
- Excuse me?

615
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:15,272
For why you did what you did,
and you threw gas on the fire.

616
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,608
- I gave him an explanation.

617
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,245
- Yeah,
you told him he was nothing.

618
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,982
About a half an hour ago, you
told me this was all your fault.

619
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,718
- A half an hour ago,
I was thinking about what I did.

620
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,687
I wasn't thinking
about what you said to him.

621
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,155
- It doesn't matter
what I said to him.

622
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,224
I saved him.

623
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,194
- Harvey, you said before
if it had been anybody

624
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,597
Other than mike, you would have
done what logan wanted

625
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,601
Well, if anybody other than mike
had walked in here

626
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,637
The way he did,

627
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,872
You would have shown him
the tiniest bit of compassion.

628
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,141
- He bought those tapes
before he ever walked in here.

629
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,812
- Those tapes were not the first
thing that he told you about,

630
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,280
But he made damn sure
they were the last.

631
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,116
- So you just flagged me down
to call me an asshole?

632
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,217
- No, I flagged you down
to tell you

633
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,252
That he's not gonna listen
to you,

634
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,955
But he might listen
to somebody else.

635
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,394
- Just heard from louis.

636
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,929
He has the stomach flu,

637
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:13,697
So I'm gonna have to step in
tonight.

638
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,833
- Oh, that's too bad.

639
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,868
- This wouldn't have anything
to do with him thinking

640
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,637
You're in love with him,
would it?

641
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:20,804
- No idea.

642
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,239
- Feel like sushi?

643
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,375
- Jeff, you can play
all the games that you want,

644
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,810
But an all-night review
of the evidence

645
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,679
Is a waste of my time.

646
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,414
So why don't you get
a couple of associates?

647
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,950
And I will see you
in the morning.

648
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:37,121
- Listen, if you don't want
to be here, that's fine.

649
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,722
But I am gonna do this
by myself,

650
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,658
Because I don't have associates
do my work.

651
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,992
- And why is that?

652
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,194
- Do you really want
to know why?

653
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,835
Dalton foster was a con man
who somehow convinced

654
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,805
Terminally ill people to sign
over their insurance policies.

655
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,241
Anyway,
he was my first big case,

656
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,777
So I decided
that I would get some help

657
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:04,415
Going through the evidence,
just like this.

658
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,717
The help screwed up.

659
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,218
Dalton foster walked.

660
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,922
Six months later,
he pulled the exact same scam.

661
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,824
Only this time, the problem was,

662
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:17,394
One of his dying clients
had a miraculous recovery.

663
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:22,232
So one day, dalton came up
from behind her...

664
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,170
And he beat her to death
with an aluminum bat.

665
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,441
So am I glad you're here,
jessica?

666
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,975
Yes.

667
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,444
Did I take advantage of louis?

668
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:34,978
Absolutely.

669
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,215
I may play games
to get us together,

670
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:42,019
But I never play games
with a case.

671
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,321
Never.

672
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,197
- You have a minute?

673
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,331
- This must be serious.

674
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,301
- Because you usually
just tell me what to do.

675
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,803
- Remember when you said
if I want you to deliver

676
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,039
A message to mike,
I should come to you directly?

677
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,310
- You want me to get him
to give up.

678
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,412
- If mike doesn't give up
tonight,

679
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,280
Logan is gonna hire someone
to dig up

680
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,283
Everything they can on him.

681
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,853
- That's why you went to gillie.

682
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,321
You had no choice.

683
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:20,157
- That's not the way
mike saw it.

684
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,026
- You know, you could have come
to me before you did that.

685
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,229
- I'm coming to you now.

686
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,033
- The same way
we bill everything.

687
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,970
Say it took twice as long
as it did.

688
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,313
- [groans]

689
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,249
Okay, I take it back.

690
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,483
My strategy?

691
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,852
My strategy isn't
"knockout punch."

692
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,954
We should've called it
"needle in a haystack."

693
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,322
- Getting frustrated?

694
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,459
- This guy?
This guy does not shut up.

695
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,060
I now know about his bronchitis,

696
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,929
His problems
with his dry cleaner,

697
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,031
But absolutely no explanation
whatsoever

698
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,368
- Oh, you mean besides
being tipped that he invested

699
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,869
In a giant ponzi scheme.

700
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,571
Wait.

701
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:11,074
- It's a call with an analyst
predicting a downturn

702
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,044
In small-cap stocks
in the next quarter.

703
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:18,515
Listen.

704
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,324
- The ponzi fund was made up
of small-cap stocks.

705
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,562
- That's a legit reason for him
to have cashed out.

706
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:35,432
- Exactly what we need to get
the charges dropped.

707
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:38,435
- And exactly the kind of call
a junior attorney

708
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:42,606
Might have missed.

709
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,908
- So do you see why we needed
to do this together?

710
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,443
- Yes, I see.

711
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,346
- [chuckles]

712
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,022
What is it?

713
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:03,927
- [sighs]

714
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,364
I have responsibilities that you

715
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,566
Just don't want to understand.

716
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,202
- No, I don't.

717
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,139
- I am the only woman partner

718
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,475
At this level in the city.

719
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,311
If word got out
that I hired a partner

720
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,913
That I was
in a relationship with...

721
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,581
- What, you'd be disbarred?

722
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:29,219
- You think this is a joke.

723
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,257
- I think you're making excuses
for keeping me out of your life,

724
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,058
Jessica,
and I'm calling you on it.

725
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,493
- Oh, what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

726
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,063
- It means that I'm making you
a promise, all right,

727
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,199
That no one... no one will ever
find out about us,

728
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:45,302
So if that's what
you're really afraid of,

729
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,571
If that's what's truly
holding you back,

730
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,940
Then it is off the table.

731
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:00,217
- I'm sorry.

732
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,501
- Hey, so I know we said

733
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:19,236
We're not supposed to talk
about the deal...

734
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:22,506
- Why did you lie to me?

735
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,978
- What are you talking about?

736
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,616
- When I asked you
about you and logan,

737
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,720
You said that you ended it.

738
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,357
According to this,
you swore it was him.

739
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,397
- This is my deposition
from his divorce.

740
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,171
You read this?
Why... why would...

741
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:58,141
- He looked into me.
I looked into him.

742
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,343
- This is looking into me.

743
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,645
- You still haven't answered
the question.

744
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,613
- Mike, I told you the truth.

745
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,651
Logan was trying to patch
things up with his wife,

746
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,387
And he asked me to back
his story, so I did.

747
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:15,258
- You lied for him.

748
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,394
You loved him that much.

749
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,629
- I told you that I loved him.

750
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:23,333
- Yeah,
but you didn't tell me that.

751
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,135
And I've been sitting here
all night

752
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,671
Wondering why you wouldn't...

753
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,442
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

754
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,552
- I'm gonna tell you now.

755
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:48,091
We had an affair.

756
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:53,096
We fell in love,
and he wanted to marry me,

757
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:56,800
And I said no,

758
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:01,104
And then three months later,
he had a change of heart,

759
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,706
And he wanted to get back
with his wife

760
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,142
During his divorce proceedings,
so he asked me to help him,

761
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:09,579
And I did.

762
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,783
But when he wanted to marry me,
I said no,

763
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:17,387
Because he wasn't the man
I want to spend my life with.

764
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,457
You are.

765
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,539
- I love you.

766
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,608
- I love you too.

767
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,358
- Surprise.

768
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,593
What? What?
- You have to go.

769
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:01,098
- Logan,
is there somebody at the door?

770
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,766
- Just...

771
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,669
- I am, um...
I'm from pearson hardman,

772
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,872
And I... I had a few files
to bring your husband.

773
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,110
- Where are they?

774
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,712
- They're... they're right here.

775
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,781
Um...

776
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,385
- Get out.

777
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,720
- Allison, what the hell?

778
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,222
- It is 7:30 in the morning.
