00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,324
Oh.

164
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,193
They're named
after my daughters.

165
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,429
I started the company
because of them, really.

166
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,131
You know,
dolls didn't used to be

167
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,303
these cheap, plastic bimbos
from China that we have today.

168
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,638
Your mother made them for you
by hand.

169
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:13,908
I wanted my girls to have
that same experience.

170
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:16,044
And here we are,
30 years later.

171
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,413
Every parent's worst nightmare.

172
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:19,714
What do you mean?

173
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:23,185
These little angels,
they sell for $90 a pop.

174
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,288
I wasn't born with a butler,
you know.

175
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,823
I gotta say, this is amazing,

176
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:29,058
taking on a project
like a licensing deal.

177
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,493
Why is that amazing?

178
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,528
Well, my grandmother
could never pull this off.

179
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:35,998
She's been retired
for ten years.

180
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,333
How is that treating her?

181
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,534
She lives near my apartment.

182
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,102
I get to see her
once a week, so...

183
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,371
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.

184
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:44,172
No, it's not.

185
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:51,146
You know, whenever I needed her,
she was there.

186
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,681
You know, no matter what.

187
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,817
She'd give me a hug,

188
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,352
she'd tell me everything
is gonna be all right.

189
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,653
And...

190
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,187
Even if it wasn't.

191
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:02,858
And now that she needs me,
I am always at work.

192
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,726
And I'm...

193
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,862
I'm so sorry.

194
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,565
Yeah?

195
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,067
Never answer your phone
in front of a client.

196
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,136
- But it's you.
- What's happening?

197
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,805
Well, actually we're
in the middle of a tea party.

198
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,274
I knew you were
the doll-playing type.

199
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:20,709
Put Joy on.

200
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,477
Ms. McAfee,

201
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:23,478
it's Harvey.

202
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,347
Oh.

203
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,581
Joy, I'm sorry,

204
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:28,349
I have to reschedule.

205
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:29,751
No need to apologize.

206
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,285
I like this one.

207
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,288
I'll send him back after tea.

208
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,171
Tell me you didn't ask
our client for a doggy bag.

209
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:51,775
What can I say? Stacy insisted.

210
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,777
Just got off with
Joy McAfee's general counsel.

211
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,746
It seems she had an epiphany.

212
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,782
She wants less on her plate,
not more.

213
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,083
I thought you
were going to close her.

214
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,252
We need that doll money.

215
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,187
I'm on top of it.

216
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,755
Harvey took five months
to structure that deal.

217
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,324
Please don't make me set fire
to your desk.

218
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,493
I...

219
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:13,529
All you had to do
was have tea with the dolls.

220
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,497
Donna, schedule another
tea party with Joy

221
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:16,498
as soon as possible.

222
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,967
And text me
the names of her girls.

223
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,402
Oh, what a shock.

224
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,469
You can't keep girls' names
straight in your head.

225
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:22,038
Just yours, Debbie.

226
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:24,675
See, that's funny
because your name is Donna.

227
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,111
Harvey Specter.

228
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,614
I got your order right here.

229
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:30,882
I didn't order a pizza.

230
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,951
You've been served.

231
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,189
Cab driver who hit Ray

232
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,124
named me as a witness
in a civil suit.

233
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,792
I need to pay Travis Bickle
a visit.

234
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,993
Harvey,
if you let me go talk to Joy,

235
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,328
I know I can fix this... No.

236
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:46,263
You don't send a puppy
to clean up its own mess.

237
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,864
Optimally,
you don't even have a puppy.

238
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:58,808
Ross, rumor has it you talked
a client out of $200 million.

239
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:00,644
The deal's not off the table,
all right?

240
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,045
It's just a speed bump.

241
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,747
Dude, I think we just
found him a new nickname.

242
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:06,083
Speed Bump!

243
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,119
I feel like
I'm back in high school.

244
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:09,821
They called you Speed Bump
in high school?

245
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,322
Kidding.

246
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:13,925
But if you need any boxes
to pack up your office, just...

247
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,993
Ow.

248
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,461
Hmm, wait a minute, uh...

249
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,563
There.

250
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,864
I think that belongs to you.

251
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:21,066
It wouldn't hurt so much
if you had thicker skin.

252
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,577
What do you want?

253
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,314
I wanna pay you back
for posting bail.

254
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,082
Trevor, you've owed me
40 bucks since fifth grade.

255
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,417
I wrote it off, okay?

256
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,486
Look, I want a clean slate,
okay?

257
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,255
So you don't want to see me,
I'll mail you a check.

258
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,394
Okay.

259
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,896
Yeah, let's hang out
tomorrow night.

260
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,031
Nothing crazy, though,
all right?

261
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,032
I have to be up early.

262
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,201
We can crochet panty hose

263
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,669
if that's what it takes
to be cool.

264
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,104
I think we can do
a little better than that.

265
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,040
Why don't we, uh...

266
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,941
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.

267
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,509
First six rounds are on me.

268
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:02,077
If you're serious
about paying me back,

269
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,912
the first 100 rounds
are on you.

270
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,813
All right.

271
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,167
So it's the tough guy.

272
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:31,104
This is a matter for insurance,

273
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,572
not a frivolous lawsuit.

274
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:33,873
You know, for your information,

275
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,141
I suffered emotional pain.

276
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:37,311
Emotional pain?

277
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:38,645
Rub this
on your emotional pain.

278
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,882
You condescending son of a...

279
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,884
Look at me,
I am gonna warn you once.

280
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,087
Do not pursue this matter.

281
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,157
You know, I have been held up
at gunpoint three times.

282
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,926
So do you think a fancy suit

283
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,295
and a $500 haircut,
that's gonna scare me?

284
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,931
You take my driver to court,
I'm gonna represent him myself.

285
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,799
And when you lose,

286
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,401
you'll be covering my fee,

287
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:00,969
which is gonna be
a hell of a lot of haircuts.

288
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:03,938
Hmm, so you weren't
a one-way fare.

289
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,373
Ray's worked for me
eight years.

290
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,274
Then you don't have to worry
about being a witness,

291
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,476
because as his employer,

292
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,078
you're liable for his actions.

293
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,679
You know, I think you've seen

294
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,981
way too many reruns
of <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

295
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:18,319
Hmm. You know, I emigrated
here after September 11th,

296
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:19,987
and they shut the doors
on everybody.

297
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:23,425
I couldn't pay for a lawyer,
so I had to take them to court.

298
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,193
I sued for my citizenship,

299
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,163
so I have
a very special appreciation

300
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,598
for the law.

301
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:32,268
I appreciate
a good single malt.

302
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,003
I don't pretend I can make one.

303
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,605
I wiped the floor

304
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,741
with the U.S. government,
counselor.

305
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,977
I'm gonna do the same with you.

306
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,657
- Ray.
- Donna.

307
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,426
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.

308
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,261
Uh, I need to see Harvey.

309
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:03,462
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.

310
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,196
No one sets foot in there
without a warrant,

311
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,765
a papal edict, or my say-so.

312
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,765
I just got named

313
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,133
in a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit.

314
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,568
The accident wasn't my fault.

315
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:11,835
Can I get in to see Harvey,
please?

316
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,804
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.

317
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,906
You are so beautiful
when you're forceful.

318
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:18,809
I know you meant that
as a compliment,

319
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:19,977
but I don't appreciate

320
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:22,212
limitations
being placed on my beauty.

321
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:26,482
Harvey,
I'm already losing money

322
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:27,583
with my car in the shop.

323
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,285
A trial means I can't work.

324
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,486
And how do you think
my name is gonna play

325
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:31,854
in front of a New York jury?

326
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:33,389
Rahim Benghazi.

327
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:35,291
I may as well buy
a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.

328
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,392
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,

329
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:39,227
I won't even be able
to afford a livery license,

330
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,662
let alone my insurance.

331
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,730
That's why I'm gonna be
defending both of us.

332
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,533
Ray, this goes against
every fiber of my being.

333
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,035
I'm taking your case pro bono.

334
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,571
I don't know what to say.

335
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:53,307
Absolutely nothing, I've got
a reputation to maintain.

336
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,809
Besides,
it's not gonna take long, okay?

337
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,844
I'm gonna get it dismissed.

338
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,947
Donna, call the court.

339
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,115
We need priority status
on the docket.

340
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,284
Yeah, I already tried.

341
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:06,221
You drew Judge Palermo.

342
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:07,322
You know what you have to do,
don't you?

343
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,524
Yeah. The other thing
that goes against

344
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,861
every fiber of my being.

345
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:15,898
Louis, has anyone told you
you're an exquisite soprano?

346
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,065
What do you want, Harvey?

347
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,868
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?

348
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,937
I need you to get me in
to see Judge Palermo.

349
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,807
You need my help, and you're
not gonna pull rank on me?

350
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:33,547
Your case has nothing to do
with firm business, does it?

351
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,781
What's it gonna take?

352
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:37,483
A mani-pedi? Tickets to Celine?

353
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,686
I'll see what I can do.

354
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,788
And your pound of flesh?

355
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,924
I need my back scratched,
I'll let you know.

356
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,395
Louis, unless that's
a metaphor, the deal's off.

357
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,396
Huh.

358
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,598
Joy, when I told you

359
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,600
that my grandmother
didn't have much time,

360
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,570
I... I didn't realize that
she's 15 years older than you.

361
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,505
Now, how would you know
how old I am?

362
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,440
That is
a very closely guarded secret.

363
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:02,277
I did some research.

364
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,145
Very resourceful.

365
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,313
I did it to assure myself

366
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,049
that you can handle
a heavier workload.

367
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,150
I appreciate that,

368
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,919
but I'm not worried
about my health.

369
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:11,053
Is it the money?

370
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,589
Because I can guarantee,
200 million up front

371
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,157
is just 1/10 of what you
stand to make on this deal.

372
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,258
Michael,

373
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:19,395
my dolls eat better
than most people.

374
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,997
I've got plenty of money.

375
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,099
This deal meant staying on
for five more years

376
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,601
and doubling my workload.

377
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,375
I am going to take
my grandchildren on a cruise

378
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,644
to Tahiti. Tahiti?

379
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,914
You know,
the licensing agreement

380
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,048
includes a theme park.

381
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,483
You could...
you could take them there.

382
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,119
It's not about the deal.

383
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,388
I have had this same view
for 25 years.

384
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:45,756
I need a change of scenery.

385
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,525
I am gonna speak to Harvey,
and I'm gonna tell him

386
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,093
that I want to sell
the whole business.

387
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,030
So...

388
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,632
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.

389
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,300
And because he thinks
I'm a good guy,

390
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,302
and I told him I'd owe him one,

391
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:04,140
your case is gonna be
moved up way ahead.

392
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:05,308
Back scratch.

393
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,575
I don't have a firstborn,
you know,

394
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,877
so what exactly
do you want for that?

395
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,347
No, you're not getting
one of my ties.

396
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:12,382
No.

397
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,685
Your shoulder? What...

398
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,487
your lapel...

399
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:19,490
Donna?

400
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:20,724
Oh, God.

401
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,326
Norma is going to Istanbul
for two weeks,

402
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,362
and you know
that I'm not good with temps.

403
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,130
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.

404
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,599
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.

405
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:28,867
You owe me now.

406
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,902
Donna is one thing
that I can't give you.

407
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,504
- Why not?
- For one thing,

408
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,672
she'd never agree to it.

409
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,739
You're her boss.

410
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:35,873
You just tell her to do stuff.

411
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,075
I don't tell her
to do anything.

412
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,076
She just does.

413
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:39,110
All right, fine. You know what?

414
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,079
That's just... Not a problem.

415
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:42,113
I will call Judge Palermo,
and I'll tell him

416
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,214
I was mistaken,

417
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:45,283
and then your hearing
will be in,

418
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,217
I don't know, maybe six months?

419
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:48,819
I tell you what.

420
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:51,021
If you can convince her
yourself,

421
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,055
you have my blessing.

422
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,456
She's gonna love me so much,

423
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,524
you're gonna fight
to get her back.

424
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,198
Hi, Donna.

425
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,701
Harvey and I were just,
uh, talking about you.

426
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,871
And... No.

427
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,407
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

428
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,009
Yes, I do.

429
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,378
And how is that possible?

430
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:16,081
I read lips,
I know body language,

431
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,149
and I talk to Norma.

432
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:24,656
I'm not some token
you win at a fair, Louis.

433
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,125
You're not... I know you're not.
You're not a token.

434
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,126
I'm a human being, and I...

435
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,393
Yes, you are.

436
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,628
I'm sorry, I just...

437
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,833
you know what,
that just made me feel really...

438
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,468
Cheap. I...

439
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,270
No, I'm just trying to tell
you that you're really good

440
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,405
at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you...

441
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,742
It's like my soul hurts now.

442
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,612
No, Donna, listen, even if
your soul hurts a little bit...

443
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:48,980
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,082
It's okay.

445
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,084
It's gonna be fine. Don't cry.

446
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,085
Please don't cry, Donna.

447
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,653
Oh, sh...

448
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:00,826
I think I owe you one for that.

449
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,127
That was fun.

450
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:06,231
Wait a second, the...
the time that you cried,

451
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,634
and then I let your parents
stay in my condo...

452
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,069
Yup.

I did exactly what my boss

- All right? I'm working there.

484
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:04,158
Oh, yeah. What, as a lawyer?

485
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:08,095
Are you...

486
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,129
dude.

487
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:10,297
It's a long story, okay?

488
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,799
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever. Okay?

489
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,901
That is awesome!

490
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,837
Man, I... I always said

491
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:17,837
that if you quit smoking pot,

492
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,005
you could do it.

493
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

494
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,207
Yeah, oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.

495
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:22,241
Right before you
passed me the bowl.

496
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:24,210
Oh...

497
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,346
What?

498
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,314
Naw, I just...

499
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,049
I wish you trusted me enough
to tell me.

500
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:35,920
I mean, all I did was set you up
on a drug bust.

501
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,221
Oh, God, that was too soon.

502
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,256
I'm sorry.

503
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,159
Hi, ladies. How are you?

504
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,962
Um, I want to let you know,
if you... either of you

505
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,898
ever get arrested for anything,

506
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,033
you call this guy.

507
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,201
He's the best attorney
in the city.

508
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:50,870
Well,
what would we get arrested for?

509
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,773
- Um...
- I don't know.

510
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,408
I don't know. What are you
thinking about doing?

511
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:57,010
♪ I'm not like
some other brothers ♪

512
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:58,879
♪ I'm not like some
other brothers ♪

513
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:01,515
♪ But I'm ready to roll ♪

514
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,750
Uh, as your attorney,

515
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,086
I would definitely advise you
to do that.

516
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:11,090
Uh, four more. Yeah.

517
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:20,298
I must warn you
that representing yourself

518
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,933
at trial is not the...
What's he doing here?

519
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,568
You think you can schedule
a meeting without me knowing it?

520
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:24,636
Oh, no.

521
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,805
I'm privy to all communication

522
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,340
between you and the court.

523
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:30,142
Well, if your driving
matched your legal knowledge,

524
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:31,177
we wouldn't be here.

525
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:33,212
Your Honor.

526
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:35,581
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.

527
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:36,649
Insurance only covers repairs.

528
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:38,384
It does not deal
with my losses.

529
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,620
What losses?

530
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,889
Because of the accident,
I missed my chance

531
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,158
to get my taxi medallion.

532
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,326
You can't just buy it
next year?

533
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,196
The loan I got
expires in one week.

534
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,299
On top of that, a medallion
costs 300,000 this go-round.

535
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,201
Next year, 350.

536
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,403
So his entire claim
rests upon the assumption

537
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:56,938
that he would've won
this year's medallion.

538
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,205
The hallmark of America

539
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,708
is that the little guy
gets to see justice done.

540
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,343
We are all equals
in the eyes of the law.

541
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,612
That is why, out of all
the countries in the world,

542
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,714
I chose to come here.

543
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,049
What do you got to say
about that, counselor?

544
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,784
I say Atticus Finch
makes a good speech here,

545
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:12,285
but this is a fender-bender,

546
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,953
not a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit.

547
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,790
Vicarious liability
applies to discrimination,

548
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:18,325
harassment, and accidents.

549
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,963
Employers are responsible
for their employees' negligence.

550
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,364
Court finds
a reasonable suit here.

551
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,666
Trial starts tomorrow.

552
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,936
Thank you, Your Honor.

553
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:33,607
You're getting a good kick
out of this, aren't you?

554
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:34,742
I am.

555
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,977
But I'm taking this
on its merits.

556
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:38,679
And you better bring
your "A" game tomorrow,

557
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,314
'cause he's got
a legitimate claim.

558
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:44,285
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.

559
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,153
Your Honor.

560
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,992
So how many cases have you won?

561
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:54,995
I only remember
how many I've lost.

562
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,297
None.

563
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,234
Wait, what happened
to the drinks?

564
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,436
I got a better idea.

565
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,904
Let's say we get a bottle

566
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,272
and take the party
back to your place?

567
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:06,074
Make it a bottle of Dom,
and you're on.

568
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,343
All right,
how about four bottles?

569
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,845
Come on.

570
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:24,591
You guys want to get a cab?

571
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:25,959
Definitely.

572
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,161
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom.

573
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:29,295
You want to spend any more
of my money?

574
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,696
Just relax, okay?

575
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:31,964
It's an investment
in the evening.

576
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,467
And, uh, I just said the thing
about the bottles

577
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,902
to get the girls
out of the bar.

578
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:37,103
Really? 'Cause it looked like

579
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,437
you were trying to get away
from those guys.

580
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:39,906
Taxi!

581
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,541
- What guys?
- The guys in the back.

582
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,410
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on, who are they?

583
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,079
What? Those two?
I... I... I don't know.

584
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,547
Where are all the... Cabs?

585
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,283
Well, it looked like
they knew you,

586
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,818
and not in a very good way.

587
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,387
I... I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh,

588
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:52,788
flirting with our dates, okay?

589
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:53,990
I'd be pissed too

590
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,391
if I watched those legs walk
away from me.

591
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:56,492
How are we doin', ladies?

592
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:57,827
My feet are killing me
in these heels.

593
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:58,962
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Trevor, come on...

594
00:22:58,996 --> 00:22:59,962
- Taxi!
- Seriously,

595
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:00,963
stop playing with me.

596
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:02,298
What was that about back there?

597
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:04,401
Look, I'm not playing
with you, all right?

598
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,902
But just play your cards right,

599
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:08,438
maybe you and, uh,
maybe Marcella will, uh,

600
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,407
maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.

601
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:11,808
Now, it's gonna be
a tight squeeze.

602
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:12,876
Who wants to sit on my lap?

603
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,449
Want to go after him?

604
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,153
No, we're gonna get to him
through this guy.

605
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:34,180

You wanted to see me?

00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,737
Did you go see Joy
after I told you not to?

624
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,639
How did you know?

625
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,011
I didn't. Until now.

626
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,212
I told you,

627
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,846
a puppy can't clean up
its own mess.

628
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,182
Mess? All I did was tell her
about my grandmother.

629
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,284
Your job
is to make my life easier.

630
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,620
If you can't understand that,
why did I hire you?

631
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,089
Police report summarized.

Medallion bids,
attendees, and results.

634
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,364
That's why you hired me.

635
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,201
I thought you were all over
the Joy situation.

636
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,038
Instead,
you're all over page six.

637
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,374
You wanted me to do
pro bono work, this is it.

638
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,910
Pro bono enhances
a firm's image.

639
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:13,013
This makes us look
like wealthy bullies

640
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,814
against an everyman cabbie.

641
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,350
Does that seem like
it enhances our image to you?

642
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,052
I refuse to answer that,
on the grounds

643
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,253
that I don't want to.

644
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,458
Someone had a fun night.

645
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:29,062
Answer another call
you shouldn't have?

646
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,897
I... I... I didn't... I was...

647
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:32,966
Piece of advice...
when the big dog asks the puppy

648
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,502
something like that,
it's a rhetorical question.

649
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,703
Got it.

650
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:38,971
Before you go,

651
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,506
the phone call, the other day,
when you answered it

652
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,841
during the meeting...

653
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,477
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.

654
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,779
Who was it?

655
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,649
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.

656
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,184
What kind of emergency?

657
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,354
- Um...
- Was it a friend

658
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,988
who almost got you busted
for drug trafficking?

659
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,857
That friend? Trevor?

660
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,625
He's not dealing anymore,
Harvey.

661
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,760
So it was him.

662
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:02,395
He called you from jail?

663
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:05,831
You know, I make a living

664
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,533
learning how to read people,
Mike.

665
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,236
So if I saw it,
Jessica did too.

666
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,805
Is that the kind of impression
you want to leave around here?

667
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,607
This guy is not your friend.

668
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,609
He is an anchor dragging
you down. Get rid of him.

669
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:22,378
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.

670
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:23,712
I wasn't just gonna let
him rot in jail.

671
00:26:23,746 --> 00:26:25,280
What's gonna happen
the next time?

672
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:27,048
'Cause there will be
a next time.

673
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,450
You gonna bail him out?

674
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:30,851
Put yourself in jeopardy?

675
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:31,952
You know,
if it weren't for Trevor,

676
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:34,622
you and I never would've met.

677
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:36,490
Cut him loose.

678
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:43,463
We're here to see Mike Ross.

679
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:45,031
He's an associate.

680
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,366
His friend Trevor referred us.

681
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,768
Thank you.

682
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:50,536
Hey.

683
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:55,041
It looked like they knew you,
and not in a very good way.

684
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:00,780
♪ ♪

685
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:41,391
Hey!

686
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:44,795
Hey!

687
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,708
Excuse me, officer.

688
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,243
Is... is Central Park that way?

689
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,811
Yeah, just go right there.

690
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,113
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm... I'm...
I'm really terrible

691
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,747
with direction.

692
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,249
Is it this street, right here?

693
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,417
- Yeah, this street, yes.
- This street.

694
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,418
Right here?

695
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,452
- Yeah.
- Okay.

696
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:19,362
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.

697
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,565
I need to know
what the hell's going on.

698
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,405
Did you get
the red velvet cupcakes?

699
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:42,540
Yes, three dozen, extra icing.

700
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,242
How the hell did that happen?

701
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:49,513
Okay. You know what?

702
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:52,082
There. Problem solved.

703
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:56,053
I asked you,
how'd you get that tear?

704
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:02,727
A couple of guys
came to the firm.

705
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:05,363
They were looking for me.

706
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,899
I don't know what they wanted,
but I'm...

707
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,235
I'm pretty sure it something
to do with some shit Trevor did.

708
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,570
And that big brain of yours
doesn't remember

709
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:12,738
me saying to cut ties
with that loser?

710
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:13,905
You know what?

711
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,007
You've been blowing off
Joy's deal

712
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,542
all week for your friend, okay?
So please.

713
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:19,078
First of all,
Trevor's not your friend.

714
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:21,881
You want to know why
I'm loyal to Ray?

715
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:24,516
I was taking a limo,
and I left $3,000 in it.

716
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,619
Ray happened to be the driver.

717
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:28,788
He found it
and tracked me down.

718
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:30,123
Not a nickel of it was missing,

719
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,525
and his first reaction
when this accident occurred

720
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,093
was to ask if we were okay.

721
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:37,296
Now, what would Trevor's
have been?

722
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,231
Cut him off.

723
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:41,434
Now, as far as
the licensing deal goes,

724
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:43,136
just because you think
I'm blowing something off

725
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,537
doesn't mean I am.

726
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,106
Now, watch and learn.

727
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:51,646
Everything's set
for you to walk away.

728
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,282
We're selling your stake
as a block.

729
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,751
Your, uh, headhunter's

730
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:58,020
lining up your replacement
as we speak.

731
00:29:58,054 --> 00:29:59,054
Well, Harvey,

732
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,457
this was
the most wonderful surprise.

733
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:06,128
You're a long-time client
who wants to be with her family.

734
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,430
It's the least I could do.

735
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:08,865
And you'll have
all the free time in the world

736
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:10,833
to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.

737
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,101
Oh, that's great.

738
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,470
Now, how soon
can we send 'em home?

739
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,005
They're booked
on the first flight out,

740
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,007
tomorrow morning.

741
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,810
So when you had Donna
text you the girls' names...

742
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:21,945
I was talking
about her daughters.

743
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,047
And you were gonna
fly them out all along.

744
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,348
Do you remember when I said,

745
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:27,017
"You don't send a puppy
to clean up its own mess?"

746
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:28,118
Yes, Harvey, I do.

747
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,822
I'm not a puppy.

748
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:33,857
Court will come to order.

749
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:35,692
Mr. Santana,
your opening statement, please.

750
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:40,664
Driving a cab
is not very glamorous.

751
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:43,200
But it's an honest day's work.

752
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:44,835
Ever since I started,
I looked forward to a time

753
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,406
when I could tell customers
that they were riding in my cab.

754
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,975
That I was an owner-operator.

755
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,545
So I scrimped, and I saved,

756
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,016
until I finally had enough
put away to buy a medallion.

757
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,753
But...

758
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,889
Because of the actions
of this man,

759
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:07,792
I've lost that opportunity.

760
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,195
So make no mistake, this...

761
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:12,297
this trial is not about
a busted headlight.

762
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:15,067
This is a trial
about a broken dream.

763
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:18,037
Forget the case, they're gonna
make him president.

764
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:21,640
Statements
are like free throws... easy.

765
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:23,875
Nobody's playing defense.

766
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,410
Are we good at defense?

767
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:27,611
You would agree

768
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:30,447
that chauffeur drivers
cause more accidents...

769
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,915
Objection. Badgering.

770
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:32,916
Sustained.

771
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,050
Objection. Argumentative.

772
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:35,318
Leading the witness.

773
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,553
Ambiguous. Privileged.

774
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:40,157
Inflammatory. Sustained.

775
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,892
Anything further, Mr. Santana?

776
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:43,794
Yes, Your Honor,
I would like to call

777
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:46,130
to the stand Mr. Michael Ross,

778
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:48,365
please.

779
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,638
Uh...

780
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:57,673
What time had you called
for the limo

781
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,774
on the morning of the accident?

782
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,242
Uh, we were supposed to leave
at 8:30.

783
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:01,610
And what time
did you get to work?

784
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,612
Objection. Irrelevant.

785
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:05,080
It's highly relevant,
Your Honor.

786
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:07,582
It speaks to
the psychology of the driver,

787
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:08,617
Rahim Benghazi.

788
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,918
Overruled.

789
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:12,186
Answer Mr. Santana's question.

790
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,155
8:40.

791
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,356
So unless Mr. Benghazi

792
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,524
made up for that lost time,

793
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,994
you were going to be late
for that meeting, correct?

794
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,336
Yes.

795
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,672
No further questions,
Your Honor.

796
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,878
When the accident occurred,

797
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,980
you were on your way
to the medallion auction.

798
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:39,149
When and where was this auction
to take place?

799
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:41,618
9:00 a.m., City Hall.

800
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:42,686
According to the police report,

801
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,188
the accident occurred

802
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:47,624
at 8:53 a.m.

803
00:32:47,658 --> 00:32:49,192
That means you only had
seven minutes

804
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,894
to get downtown
in rush hour traffic.

805
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,696
Objection, irrelevant.

806
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,898
I believe when
I made the same objection,

807
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,532
you told his honor
it was highly relevant.

808
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:57,700
Overruled.

809
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,171
You were running late,

810
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:02,806
only the stakes for you
were much higher,

811
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,874
weren't they?

812
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:05,709
These things
never start on time.

813
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,611
Then why was
the first medallion

814
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,213
sold at 9:03 a.m.?

815
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,048
You were scared your chance

816
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,150
at a medallion
was going up in smoke,

817
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:14,852
and you ran a red.

818
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:17,756
Then you used the accident
to paint me

819
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,892
and Ray Benghazi
as a couple of scapegoats.

820
00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:21,193
You can't prove that.

821
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:22,194
What color was the light?

822
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:23,762
I take the fifth.

823
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:24,897
You can't take the fifth,
Mr. Santana.

824
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,433
This isn't a criminal case.

825
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,334
What color was the light?

826
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,337
He cut me off.

827
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,039
You claim to love
our legal system so much,

828
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:34,240
answer the question.

829
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:38,044
What color was the light?

830
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:39,979
What color was the light?

831
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,116
Your Honor?

832
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,384
Answer the question,
Mr. Santana.

833
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:55,392
It just meant so much to me.

834
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:00,129
Your Honor,

835
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,366
can I sidebar
with opposing counsel?

836
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,468
We can roll the dice
with the jury,

837
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,670
but I'd rather settle.

838
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,438
Well, how much
would I have to pay?

839
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:11,772
Nothing.

840
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,975
You take responsibility
for the accident,

841
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:15,943
and your insurance company
makes Ray whole.

842
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:16,977
In return,

843
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,845
I waive my right
to collect legal fees.

844
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:24,817
I don't know what to say.

845
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:27,285
Don't say anything.

846
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,221
I've got
a reputation to maintain.

847
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:32,590
That goes for you too, judge.

848
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,138
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.

849
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,340
Good to know your boy's
flaky with everyone.

850
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:54,375
I was taking it personal.

851
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,081
What do you want?

852
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:02,817
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000
he's never paid,

853
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,953
so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,

854
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:07,556
I don't have that kind of money,
okay? I can't.

855
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,490
Well, if you're not down here
in an hour with it,

856
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,058
we're gonna take it out
on Trevor.

857
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:13,628
Tell him where the money is.

858
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,429
Whatever you do, don't show up.

859
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,832
Trevor!

860
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,268
You have one hour.

861
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:22,738
Hello? Hello?

862
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,370
What do you think you're doing,

863
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,766
leaving in the middle
of a trial?

864
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,244
I got some things
to take care of.

865
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,279
You mean someone
to take care of.

866
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:38,747
You never cut Trevor off,
did you?

867
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:41,016
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble,

868
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,017
and I'm gonna help him.

869
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:43,651
You know what?
This is what addicts do.

870
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:46,420
The second they start
making progress, they screw up,

871
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:47,655
because deep down they think
it's only a matter of time

872
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:48,856
until they fail.

873
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,257
They'd rather fall
from the third floor

874
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,258
than the penthouse.

875
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,859
Nothing you say can stop me.

876
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:54,528
Then tell me
what the hell's going on.

877
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:04,373
He's clean. No wires.

878
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,507
Are you sure?

879
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,676
Yeah, I'm sure.

880
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,111
You remember what happened
with the guy.

881
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,847
He was 300 pounds.

882
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:13,217
Now, who'd you say
you were again?

883
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,618
Trevor's lawyer.

884
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,086
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.

885
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,921
He doesn't know he hired me.

886
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:20,757
Come on.

887
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:25,328
Open the briefcase.

888
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:33,103
Where's the goddamn money?

889
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:36,072
That photo is a screen shot,

890
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:37,907
taken from my firm's
security video.

891
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,009
We know what you look like.

892
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:41,544
And if Mike Ross
doesn't hear from me

893
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,580
in the next five minutes,
he's calling the police.

894
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,652
No, man. You're not comin'
in here and threatenin' us.

895
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:51,822
You're looking at kidnapping,
extortion, and drug-dealing,

896
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:53,056
and the district attorney

897
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:54,725
happens to be number three
on my speed dial.

898
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,794
Well, if we're looking
at all that time,

899
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,162
you might as well add murder.

900
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,966
I got a better idea.

901
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,935
Retainer agreement.

902
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:05,403
If you sign right here,

903
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:07,706
you'll become
one of my clients.

904
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,407
And I won't be able
to testify against you,

905
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:10,508
even if I wanted to.

906
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:13,344
What about the money?

907
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:15,813
This envelope contains $10,000.

908
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:17,248
Consider it a down payment
on Trevor's debt.

909
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:19,283
Only here's the thing,

910
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:20,986
I don't do pro bono work.

911
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
And my retainer agreement

912
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:25,323
requires a down payment
of $10,000.

913
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:28,361
Now, as your attorney,
my job is to give you advice.

914
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:31,130
So here's the deal.

915
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:34,500
Sign the agreement.

916
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,373
I thought I said not to come.

917
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:43,109
Remember that 40 bucks
from the fifth grade you owe me?

918
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:44,477
If you were dead,
how would I collect?

919
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,380
Oh, man.

920
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:49,415
I'm sorry, I just...

921
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,918
Put you in trouble
just by hanging out with you.

922
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:52,952
So why'd you do it?

923
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,454
'Cause I'm a dick.

924
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,125
Bet you didn't think
you'd have to save my ass

925
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,960
so soon after bailing me out.

926
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,395
I wasn't the one who saved you.

927
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:03,530
Yeah. Well, as a friend,
the guy puts me to shame.

928
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,899
Harvey's not my friend,
trust me.

929
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:09,336
Well, he didn't put his ass
on the line because of me.

930
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,872
Listen, I pled you down
to a misdemeanor...

931
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:13,340
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.

932
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,343
And I paid the fine.

933
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,011
I think it might be a good idea

934
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,646
if you got out of town
for a while.

935
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,083
Montana.

936
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:23,885
Well, you said
you wanted a clean slate.

937
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,886
I figured 20 hours on a bus
ought to do the trick.

938
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,722
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.

939
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:30,224
Wait.

940
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:35,162
When I get back,

941
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:36,564
you know who the first person
I'm gonna call is.

942
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:39,166
Yeah. The one person you know
who'll answer.

943
00:38:59,021 --> 00:38:59,988
For you.

944
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:01,222
What's this?

945
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,391
I'm very happy
you took Ray on pro bono.

946
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,294
You, on the other hand,
can afford our services.

947
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:08,696
You want me to pay me
to represent me?

948
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:10,598
Mm-hmm. Ten hours
at $1,000 an hour.

949
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,667
Eh, yeah,
I'll let you do the math.

950
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,935
You can't be serious.

951
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,603
I'll tell you
what I am serious about.

952
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,305
I hear you're finally
mentoring the kid.

953
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,307
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

954
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,642
Really, because I understand

955
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:22,410
that you dropped
the puppy analogy on him,

956
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,079
which is exactly
what I used on you.

957
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,047
May have slipped out
by accident.

958
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:27,916
Well, accident, on purpose,

959
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,718
the really important thing is,

960
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:30,986
is that I'm taller than you.

961
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,122
Yeah.

962
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,636
Yup,
you look much thinner in that.

963
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:48,106
You planted that story,
be man enough to own it.

964
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,142
I don't traffic
in the tabloids, Harvey.

965
00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:51,176
But I can see how
whoever planted this

966
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,177
might find it amusing.

967
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:54,846
You know,
the great Harvey Specter

968
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:55,981
bullying a humble cab driver.

969
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:58,283
I mean,
it's a no-win situation, really.

970
00:39:58,318 --> 00:39:59,552
Well, maybe you didn't hear.

971
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:01,420
I won the no-win situation.

972
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:04,456
Did it ever occur to you

973
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:05,524
that if you hadn't
done that to me,

974
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:07,493
I actually would have
owed you one?

975
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:09,561
Maybe if you didn't humiliate
me in front of the associates...

976
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:10,963
Louis,

977
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:14,366
for an average attorney,
100 million is a career case.

978
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,535
If I'm mocking you, it means
I think you're above average.

979
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:25,543
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.

980
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:37,388
You put Trevor on the bus
to the boondocks?

981
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:39,123
Yeah. Can I ask you a question?

982
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:40,725
After all this,

983
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,926
you really
think I'm still buying

984
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,062
the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap
thing?

985
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:47,632
Joy sent a little token
of her appreciation.

986
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:52,003
She got your hair just right.

987
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:54,773
Did she ever make
one of these for you?

988
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,141
Not that you'll ever see.

989
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:02,847
