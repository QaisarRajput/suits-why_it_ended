Harvard trivia,
the lightning round.

[Snaps] Go.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,277
Pulitzer prizes. 46.

4
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,028
- Nobel peace prizes.
- Five.

5
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:12,129
What is the oldest book in
the Harvard library collection?

6
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:13,460
- The Bible.
- Wrong.

7
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,761
The gutenberg Bible.

8
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,402
Everyone knows
it's the gutenberg Bible.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,634
Yes, but you didn't say it.

10
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:19,736
The rules dictate
you must be precise,

11
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:21,237
as the law is
a very precise endeavor.

12
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,170
- How many U.S. pr...
- Eight.

13
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:25,836
That's not fair, you didn't
even finish the question.

14
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:27,737
And yet it's right.
The question was gonna be

15
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,572
"how many U.S. presidents
attended Harvard?"

16
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,510
- You want names?
- No, we get it.

17
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:34,882
Final round. Ross ahead by one.

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,456
One question each.
Points are double.

19
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:39,625
Double 'cause he wants
to keep you in the game, Seth.

20
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,461
Bring it on, Ross.
I bleed crimson.

21
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:43,931
Oh, venomous banter.
This is adorable, I love it.

22
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,802
Ross, square pizza.
Where do you get it?

23
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,605
Are you kidding?

24
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:52,307
Any self-respecting
Harvard alumnus

25
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,175
would know the answer to that.

26
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,876
Late night studying
and you want square pizza,

27
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,211
where do you go?

28
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:59,646
Um...

29
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:01,214
You know,
I'm more of a burger guy.

30
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:04,016
I study better on protein.

[General laughter, boos]

I mean, that's just...
Pathetic.

00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:09,754
It's Pinocchio's.

34
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:11,691
Mm, I answer mine, I win.

35
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,126
Yeah, I know.

36
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,101
How many current
U.S. supreme court justices

37
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:19,502
are from our Alma mater?

38
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,406
[Overlapping chatter]
Everybody knows that.

39
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,708
Five.

40
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,711
Hah! See, I told you
Keller was better.

41
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,212
[Cheers and applause]
You owe me 20.

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,715
- Awesome.
- Got anything to say, Ross?

43
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:31,350
Nope.
Just that the answer's wrong.

44
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:34,420
Scalia, Roberts,
Kennedy, Breyer, Kagan.

45
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:35,888
- Ginsberg.
- Ruth Bader Ginsberg

46
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:38,723
went to Columbia.
She graduated from Columbia,

47
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,758
after she attended Harvard
for two years.

48
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,360
The question was phrased

49
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,428
"how many justices were
from Harvard?"

50
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,296
<i>Well, she was on
the Harvard law review.</i>

51
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,298
And when she arrived
at Columbia as a transfer,

52
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,699
she was from Harvard.

53
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,569
The rules dictate
that you must be precise,

54
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:55,273
as the law is
a precise endeavor.

55
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,141
[Broken applause]
Told you Ross was hot.

for second place.

Pro Bono, one of your very own.

63
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,946
- Louis knows what?
- My dirty little secret.

64
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,414
- You're Canadian?
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

65
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,883
No, he knows that
I didn't go to Harvard.

66
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,318
No, he doesn't.

67
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,652
How can you
be so sure about that?

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,020
Because you're walking
with me right now.

69
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,755
He did this whole
Harvard trivia thing,

70
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:38,756
and then he brought up
this pizza...

71
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,325
Doesn't mean he knows.

72
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:41,792
Look, I think we need to hack

73
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,927
into Harvard's system
or something.

74

unless you give them reason to.

Louis is devious,
but he's not bold.

82
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,948
He won't think we did this.

83
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,051
Because he'd never
think to do it himself.

84
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,453
Doubloons?

85
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,255
The ridiculousness of
your suggestion

86
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,424
warranted the use of
a silly word.

87
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,559
Got it.

88

[Soft knocking]

Mm-hmm. You know him?

91
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,013
I know of him.

92
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,049
Why was he holding your hands?
Kissing them?

93
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,684
What are you implying, Harvey?

94
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,385
I don't know, maybe
you two are going steady.

95
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,122
I was implying
that it looked like

96
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,157
he was grateful to you
for taking his case.

97
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,293
Good, 'cause that's
exactly what it was.

98
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,329
That's a bad move.
We may make money

99
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,397
billing out on their defense,
but when we lose...

100
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,700
Which we will... It's gonna
hurt us in the long run.

101
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:51,036
- How do you know we'll lose?
- Because it's my job to know.

And his company's ALS
wonder drug is killing people.

103
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,042
ALS is incurable.

104
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,777
And everyone
who is taking that drug

105
00:03:57,844 --> 00:03:59,412
is going to die anyway.

106
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,148
Hm. That's your defense?

107
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:04,750
If he kills them a little
faster, it's a public service?

108
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,921
Our defense is
those allegations are untrue.

109
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,490
He has taken
this story all over town,

110
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,425
and not a single firm thinks
he has a case.

111
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,027
Which is why he came to me.

112
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,896
Because he wants someone
who believes in him.

113
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,432
And what is it exactly
that makes you believe in him?

- A wedding gift.

131

I'm sorry it's so late,
but it's hard to be on time

132
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,871
when I never
knew you were married.

133

Are you seeing anyone, Harvey?

134
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,275
Hm?

135
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:30,110
You don't wanna tell me,
and I don't really care.

136
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,746
Because you and I share
the same trait

137
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,347
of keeping our
personal lives personal.

138
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,982
You were married.

139
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,184
It happened when you were at
Harvard, didn't work out.

140
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:40,119
We were too dedicated
to our careers,

141
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,222
and that's all
I'm going to say about it.

142
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,990
Okay. You're right.

143
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:46,092
It's none of my business.

144
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,427
I'm still not taking this case.
Why is that?

145
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,129
Because sometimes I do things
that my clients don't like.

146
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,499
And if their ex-wives
are looking over my shoulders,

147
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,934
that's not really a problem.

148
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:58,070
But when their ex-wives
are also my managing partner,

149
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,972
that hamstrings me.

150
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,642
And if I'm gonna turn
this loser into a winner,

151
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,443
I can't be hamstrung.
I can't have that.

- You won't interfere?
- What did I just say?

154
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:15,321
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to develop a new drug

155
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,792
if you're not Pfizer,
or Amgen, or Merck?

156
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,127
This is important, Harvey.

157
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:24,264
If Quentin came to you looking
for someone to trust him,

158
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,899
why aren't you handling
this case yourself?

159
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,501
That's none of your concern.

00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,703
Well, I'm not asking you
that as your colleague,

161

I'm asking you
as Quentin's attorney.

162
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,510
After Quentin and I separated,

163
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:42,647
he started seeing
one of his research consultants.

164

165
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,818
But he never married her.

166
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,253
She doesn't want me
on the case.

167
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,520
Oh, terrific.

168
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,989
You're sticking me with
a losing case,

169
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,290
and a girlfriend
who isn't gonna like me

170
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,825
anymore than she likes you.

171
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,160
Well, I'm sure
it's not the first time

172
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,962
someone hasn't liked you,
Harvey.

173

[Retreating footsteps]
Who doesn't like me?

174
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,970
Picture the devil
without the charm.

175
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,838
Okay, so Karinski owned
this building for two years?

176
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,607
Yeah, then things got bad.

177
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,910
Three below, the heat went out
and I nearly froze to death.

178
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,378
Then a gas leak in my stove.

179
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:14,214
You could smell the damn thing,
but he said it was fine.

180
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:16,416
I called for a month,
then I had to replace it myself.

181
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,485
Why didn't you just move?

182
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,455
This is the apartment
that I grew up in.

183
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,922
It's the only place
I've ever known.

184
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,924
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

185
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,327
My parents...
Not with me anymore.

186
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,397
I'm not leaving the
one connection I have to them.

187
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,767
You said you weren't sleeping.
Are you stressed out, or...?

188
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,070
- Bedbugs.
- No.

189
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,405
My place is literally
crawling with them.

190
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,842
Could you sleep knowing the
minute you turn out the light,

191
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,744
they're coming for you?
No, I couldn't.

192
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,847
Well, Karinski won't do
anything about it without proof,

193
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,015
and I can't get someone
from the city down

194
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,350
to verify they're there.

195
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,220
Don't worry. I can.

196
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,256
Two weeks. Next Thursday.

I-I-I-I don't think
that you heard me.

198

I need someone
down there today.

199
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,728
- Two weeks, next Thursday.
- Okay.

200
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,898
Uh, I'd like to speak
to your supervisor, please.

201
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,299
You can do that next Wednesday.

202
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,436
Okay, glenda, let me
tell you what I'm gonna do

203
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,237
between now
and next Wednesday...

204
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:06,739
I know exactly
what you're gonna do.

205
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,407
You're gonna do what
every lawyer threatens to do.

206
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,242
You're gonna
file a 409/3 grievance

207
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,110
claiming that I did
not fulfill my obligation

208
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,611
to promptly direct you
to my supervisor.

209
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,247
A grievance that will
be passed on to my supervisor

210
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,049
next Wednesday.

211
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:21,886
No, what I'm gonna do
is hire a private investigator

212
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:24,356
to look into
every aspect of your life

213
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:26,992
from the day you were born
until next Tuesday.

214
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,228
And then I'm gonna use
whatever it is they find

215
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,130
to make you wish
that your biggest problem

216
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:35,335
was keeping this job
that you seem to hate so much.

217
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,306
Yeah, I'm not like
every other lawyer, glenda.

218
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,607
What did you say your name was?

219
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,410
Specter.

220
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:46,346
Harvey Specter.

221

- You're a baseball fan?
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,921
Then I assume you know
Lou gehrig was a bad man.

223
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:58,191
They didn't call him
the iron horse for nothing.

224
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,227
Then he got ALS.
You know what it did to him?

225
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,430
His hands locked up,
then his legs,

226
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,432
his speech,
eventually his breathing.

227
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,700
Couldn't control 'em.

228
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,403
His mind knew what it wanted,
but his body...

229
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,806
He was trapped inside,
unable to do anything.

230
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:14,242
Even today, you get ALS,

231
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,810
within three to five years,
you die.

232
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,346
Or sooner, if someone takes
your drug and their liver fails.

233
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:20,982
Our drug makes people's
remaining years better,

234
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,784
and it doubles
their life expectancy.

235
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,485
Except for the people
who's livers are failing.

236
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:26,521
- You don't...
- Lisa.

237

[Whispers] It's okay.

238
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:32,360
I can see why Jessica likes you.
You cut through the bullshit.

239
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,296
That's something
I always loved about her.

240
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:37,432
She just does it with
a little less charm than I do.

241
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,000
Isn't she
a little taller than you?

242
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,735
- It's the heels.
- Let me tell you what it takes

243
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:42,871
to get a drug approved today.

244
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,873
We were $139 million
into development

245
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,109
before we ever hit the shelves.

246
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:49,245
We jumped through
every hoop they threw at us,

247
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,447
and we proved our drug
was safe for eight years.

248
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,048
So you're saying
these claims are baseless?

249
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,251
We're talking
about six terminal patients

250
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:57,219
with a wide array of
medical issues

251
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,788
and they're saying
my company's drug caused this?

252
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,857
<i>They were drinking coffee
on the Titanic.</i>

253
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,794
I don't think that put
Leonardo Dicaprio in the water.

254
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,229
Since Jessica vouched for you,

255
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,465
I'm gonna go ahead and
believe what you're telling me.

256
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:12,101
But since these other firms
determined you have exposure,

257
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,969
here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna pay them.

258
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:15,638
We're gonna pay them
a little bit of money

259
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,674
so you can keep saving lives,
because if we drag this out,

260
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,943
people won't think of your drug
as a way to save lives,

261
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,313
they'll think of it as
a death sentence.

262
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,449
The guy from
the housing department's

264
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,686
How did you manage that?

265
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,054
You know, they're
actually pretty receptive

266
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:35,091
when you explain
the situation to them.

267
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,560
That's what you have to do
to prevent the spread.

268
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,396
I had to get rid of most
of my things...

269
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:41,631
Clothes,
record collection, books.

catcher in the rye,</i>

271

you know what that was worth?
No.

272
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:48,037
The bugs can live dormant
for 18 months.

273
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,772
You just have
to throw everything out.

Funny you should mention that,

because the apartment
is not habitable.

That's my code.

But if you

There's a court order.
You got three days to get out.

I went to the client's place,

it was overrun with bedbugs,
so I went back to the office...

You tracked bedbugs

- No.
- You walked in there naked?

No, Donna met me in
the downstairs men's room...

Okay, Donna's fired, and
you're buying me an extra suit.

By the way,

00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,445
about the strengths
and weaknesses of our cases,

314
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,347
but frankly, that's gonna
bore the hell out of me.

315
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,185
Seriously?

316
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:47,588
- It could be much lower.
- It could be much higher.

317
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,691
Then let's pretend
it's just right.

318
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:53,060
My client's lives are
being cut short.

319
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,963
And according to
accepted calculations,

320
00:12:56,031 --> 00:13:00,134
the current value of a life
is $7.9 million.

321
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:03,170
You're not even
offering pennies on that.

322
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,305
Those happen
to be e.P.A. Calculations

323
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,374
based on
a full life expectancy.

324
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,876
Adjusted for plaintiffs

325
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,578
who's expectancy
is just a fragment of this,

326
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:14,882
yields a value of $143,427.

327
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:18,018
Approximately.

328
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:21,422
What your child fails
to understand is that

329
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,492
for someone with only
three to five years to live,

330
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,462
each day is
worth infinitely more.

331
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,932
But the real crux
is the punitive damages.

332
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,403
Because if your client
wants to sell me the idea

333
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:38,341
that he didn't know about
these side effects years ago,

334
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,676
I'm not buying it.

335
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:42,445
Which is why
we want $250 million.

336
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:43,946
- What?
- Quentin.

337
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,549
No, man. This is outrageous.

338
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,750
Do you know what you're doing?

339
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,318
You're bankrupting this company

340
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,387
and taking away years of life
from real people

341
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,656
who are walking, talking,
and breathing easier

342
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,291
because of the drug we make.

343
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,228
I don't represent those people.

344
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,930
- My clients...
- Have tenuous claims at best.

345
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:03,032
And unless one of your six
is Rupert Murdoch,

346
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,101
you're out of your mind.
[Sighs]

347
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,338
Okay.

348
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,308
You printed that?

349
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,844
Well, not yet. But I will.

350
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:16,079
You realize that's libelous.

351
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,081
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

352
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,550
But after it runs,
you and I both know,

353
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,051
it won't much matter.

354
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,687
We're done here.
I don't take to extortion.

355
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,622
I'm not gonna be bullied by
an ambulance-chaser,

356
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,459
no matter how nice his suit.
It is nice, isn't it?

357
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,527
Italian. And it fits.

358
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:35,064
$250 million, Mr. Sainz.

359
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:37,966
I'll give you four days.

360
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,414
Church wants to play, we play.

361
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,116
[Thud]

362
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,551
I have housing court
in the morning.

363
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,920
It's housing court.
Your grandmother could win.

364
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,156
- [Sighs]
- Let's see just how real

365
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,724
his clients'
liver problems are.

366
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,660
And if they are real,
we suggest they're from

367
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,463
the disease itself,
or they took the wrong dose,

368
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,999
or they took a cocktail
of combined drugs.

369
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,036
Also, I wanna see
Quentin's company financials.

370
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,237
I already asked for them once.

371
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,972
I want you to call them
and follow-up.

372
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,074
I wanna know everything
Church could go after.

373
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:16,143
So we've gone from
settlement to scorched earth.

374
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:18,846
I didn't feel like writing
a $1/4 billion check.

375
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,481
- It's a negotiation.
- Exactly.

376
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,383
That's why I'm arming myself
for the next round.

377
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,251
By digging into Quentin?

378
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,153
I'm a boy scout.
I like to be prepared.

379
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,088
Hmm.

380
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,559
So you think
you'll look like a boy scout

381
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:34,093
by putting dying people
on the stand

382
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,596
and tearing them apart?

383
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:36,797
[Thuds] Mm.

384
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,332
You're gonna
look like an asshole.

385
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,434
For every one they claim
has a side effect,

386
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:42,404
we have 600 who don't.

387
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,374
And if I need to look like
an asshole to convince the jury

388
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,877
that hundreds are
more important than the one,

389
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,745
I'm not gonna lose
a minute's sleep over it.

390
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:54,250
Well, I have court
in the morning.

391
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,686
Oh, I'm... I'm not clear.

392
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:59,122
Was this a conversation with
my managing partner

393
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,656
or my client's ex-wife?

394
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:03,092
You need to
settle this case, Harvey.

395
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,061
Which I will do
if you stay out of it...

396
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,897
As you promised.

397
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,567
Make it go away.

398
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,171
- Rachel.
- Go away.

399
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:15,706
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, oh.

400
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:19,143
Who's picking on you now, Mikey?
Mom and dad are fighting.

401
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,111
Harvey and Jessica.
What do you care?

402
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,747
Oh, I'm just rattled.

403
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,550
My first trial tomorrow
in housing court.

404
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,786
Housing court?

405
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,422
I could win at housing court.
You'll be fine.

406
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,258
- [Sighs]
- But not if you wear that suit.

407
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,369
Carvello versus
Karinski properties.

408
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,104
So how does this usually work?

409
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:51,208
Uh, well, usually
the trial starts,

410
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:54,110
and there's the judge,
and then... You know,

411
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,812
people say things.

412
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,115
You've never done
this before, have you?

413
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,817
Well,
I never drove a car before

414
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,286
the first time I drove one,
and I'm still here, aren't I?

415
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,189
[Sighs]

416
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,058
This is your first time?

417
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,926
I'm your first?

418
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,064
Don't worry, I promise
not to be gentle.

419
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,633
Frank. It's nice to see you.

420
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,135
One last time.

421
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,838
If it pleases the court...

422
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:22,308
It pleases the court
to decide who speaks and when.

423
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,712
I'll sit down.

424
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,814
We're talking about $4,000
in withheld rent pas...

425
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,850
Yes, your honor.
But we have receipts

426
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,652
for repairs, lost clothing,
as well as...

427
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,089
$4,000. Yes, your honor.

428
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,424
[Whispers]
She was talking to me.

429
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,862
Oh. [Chuckles]

430
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,631
Why hasn't he paid, counselor?

431
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,366
Uh, that one was for you.

432
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,968
Bedbugs, your honor.

433
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:52,504
I have receipts that show
my client's financial outlay

434
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,407
to rectify the problem
far exceeds the amount.

435
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,444
Housing department certified
the presence of bedbugs?

436
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,179
- Uh, yes, your honor.
- Abatement?

437
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,418
Excuse me.

438
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:08,221
I'll do it. There you go.

439
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,758
Your honor, this is
an eviction hearing.

440
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,960
The pertinent question is
not habitability,

441
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,595
but whether or not rent
has been paid.

442
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:19,298
Actually, city code states
that rent may be withheld

443
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,401
if the warranty of
habitability is breached.

444
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,104
Mm.

445
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,006
In that case, we request
to see the checks.

446
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,573
Mr. Ross' client
has placed in escrow.

447
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,943
- The... Uh...
- Checks, in escrow.

448
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,778
Pending the outcome of
a rent abatement hearing?

449
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:37,617
- That's not in the code.
- It is the accepted practice.

450
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:40,320
And therefore
binding in this courtroom.

451
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:43,391
Your client did put money
in escrow, I assume.

452
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,759
- I didn't have any money left...
- Your honor...

453
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,427
[Gavel pounds] Eviction upheld.

454
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,030
- But your honor, he...
- Did you see me bang the gavel?

455
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:51,467
That means step aside.
Next case.

456
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,904
You never forget your first.

457
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,213
You know what happens
to pitchers

458
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,848
when they get shelled
in rookie league, Mike?

459
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,616
You think they make it
to the bigs?

460
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:11,019
Or do they just end up

461
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,222
on some sad American legion
team of has-beens?

462
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,923
I get it, I lost. I'm sorry.

463
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:16,858
[Chuckles]

464
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:20,362
Well, you're sorry.

465
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,232
- In that case...
- No, I am sorry.

466
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,534
But right now I have
some research to do for Harvey,

467
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,469
so if you'll excuse me.
Remember when you stole

468
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,304
that client I had you bring in?

469
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:30,839
That was a good time
for you, wasn't it?

470
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,875
See, I gave you a nothing case
so that when you did win

471
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,945
it would still do
nothing for your career.

472
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:40,382
But I still
expected you to win.

473
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:43,484
So yeah, I guess...
Go back to your research.

474
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,720
Maybe that is your niche.

475
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,755
[Chuckles]

476
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,457
Maybe it is.

477
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:00,467
Most mornings,
I can make it out of the chair

478
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,804
and get across the floor.
[Giggles]

479
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,172
And I can hold my daughter.

480
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:10,811
How many were in the study?

481
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,247
412, over 2 years.

482
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:15,915
And we have videos of
all of them.

483
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,850
25% were given placebos,

484
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:20,453
the rest,
varying doses of Amylinx.

485
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,455
And more than half are
like that one,

486
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,223
showing significant
signs of improvement.

487
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,725
And you're telling me there
was nothing affecting the liver?

488
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,360
Yes.

489
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,896
If you're just coming to
question that, we'll move on.

490
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,934
You don't like it that Quentin
went to his ex-wife, do you?

491
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,869
No, I don't.

492
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,106
I don't want any garbage from
the past getting in the way.

493
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,676
I mean, what Quentin's done here
is nothing short of miraculous.

494
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,513
I think I may have found a way
to keep that miracle going.

495
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,249
I was going through
the plaintiff's medical files,

496
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,186
and then I found this.

497
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,723
This is good.

498
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,291
This is really good.

499
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,693
Jones versus Norco...

500
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,195
Washburn versus
Hawthorne incorporated...

501
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:05,698
Actually, seven cases
that Mr. Church solicited

502
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,466
lawsuits against
pharmaceutical companies.

503
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:11,170
In each case, he was able
to exact a settlement

504
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,438
because the company
knew that even if they won,

505
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,675
a protracted battle would
do more damage than settling.

506
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,076
You have evidence of that?

507
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,479
Plaintiff number two
in our case, Eleanor Baker.

508
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,080
She also happens to be

509
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,684
plaintiff number seven in
Jones versus Norco.

510
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,253
He's recycling plaintiffs.
That's very green of you.

511
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,922
Mr. Church?

512
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,193
Mr. Specter has his
documents, I have mine

513
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,897
showing that prior to
fda approval of his drug,

514
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:39,267
Quentin Sainz's company
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

515
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:42,436
Three months after
that drug hit the market,

516
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:45,840
sales rocketed to
$38 million a quarter,

517
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,276
which is clear financial motive

518
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,045
for falsifying clinical trials.

519
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:52,014
Now, your honor,
does that sound like

520
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,984
a groundless claim to you?

521
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,686
[Whisper] I told you
to go over those financials.

522
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:59,022
I asked him five times,
he never gave them to me.

523
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,458
- Your honor.
- Mr. Specter,

524
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,694
you can question his tactics
all you like at trial,

525
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:05,062
but he's right.

526
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,997
That right there is
financial motive for fraud

527
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,967
this case is moving forward.
[Gavel drops]

528
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:11,502
Thank you, your honor.

529
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:31,564
Jessica,
what're you doing here?

530
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:32,799
Get in.

531
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,501
I was just about to
get some coffee.

532
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:45,678
Heard about your
little setback in court.

533
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:48,414
Getting blind-sided
by my own client holding back

534
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:50,083
isn't a setback,
it's an embarrassment.

535
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,752
- What are you talking about?
- Did you ever think

536
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,588
it's time to consider that
he isn't the upstanding man

537
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:56,157
that you think he is?

538
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:59,361
[Sighs] When we were married...

539
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,397
When I took a client
Quentin knew was guilty,

540
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,832
he never shut up about it.

541
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,268
He went on, and on,
about right and wrong.

542
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,669
Sounds annoyingly
self-righteous.

543
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:08,037
It was.

544
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:10,273
But it's also how I know
he didn't do this.

545
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:13,409
For all his faults, Quentin has
never lied to me before.

546
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,846
And he's not lying about this.

547
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,783
So stop questioning his ethics
and start winning this case.

548
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,918
We had a deal that
you were gonna stay out of it.

549
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,620
You don't know
everything I know.

550
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,124
- All right.
- That's not staying out of it.

551
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,659
No, you're right.

552
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,462
I'm not staying out
of it anymore.

553
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:40,706
I'm sorry.

554
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:42,608
You looked into
his background this deeply?

555
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,710
The investigation
reveals what it reveals.

556
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:47,079
If he lied about this,
he could've lied about anything.

557
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:48,480
You think I didn't know

558
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,215
he started with Lisa
before we were separated?

559
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,619
This is old news, Harvey.
I moved on a long time ago.

560
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:57,188
Jessica, it's
a pattern of behavior.

561
00:23:57,255 --> 00:23:58,656
Quentin came to me
because he knew

562
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:01,792
I thought he was a good man,
and I still do.

563
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,261
You obviously don't.

564
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,430
I'm taking the case.

565
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:09,934
What about Lisa?

566
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:12,137
If Lisa has a problem with it,

567
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:16,642
then Lisa can
take it up with me.

568
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:17,843
It's kind of ironic, isn't it?

569
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,879
You and I both
lost in court yesterday.

570
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:22,715
You lost... In housing court?

571
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,784
How does one
lose in housing court?

572
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,319
People win there
without lawyers.

573
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,388
Well, he had a lawyer,
Tanaka, and she...

574
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:30,557
- Vivien Tanaka?
- Yeah, what, you know her?

575
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,292
If your landlord's
using Vivien Tanaka,

576
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,128
this isn't about bedbugs.

577
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:37,098
Vivien Tanaka represents half
the high-rises in Manhattan.

578
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,501
This isn't a petty rent dispute.
Your guy's going condo.

579
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:41,236
Well, that's great.

580
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:43,305
Forcing Frank out
for conversion is harassment,

581
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:44,739
I can go after him for that.

582
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,875
No, you wanna take down Vivien,

583
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,578
you better go in there
with more than just one client.

584
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,713
You show the pattern,
the settlement goes up.

585
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,081
If they did this to him,

586
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:54,816
I guarantee
they've done this to others.

587
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,351
So I should find other
people in Frank's building?

588
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,021
Think bigger.

589
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:01,924
Bigger how?

590
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,664
Karinski owns five buildings

591
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:10,366
and they all used to be
rent-controlled,

592
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,401
but now they go for
a million and a half a unit.

593
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:13,836
Nice profit margin.

594
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,537
I went to look for
housing department complaints

595
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:17,473
in the year
prior to his remodel.

596
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,441
In each one of them,
tenants who couldn't

597
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:20,809
buy into the conversion
ended up with

598
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:23,545
some complaint...
Garbage, heat, air.

599
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:26,281
All of them, one by one,
Karinski drove them out.

600
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:27,616
You couldn't get their
names from housing complaints?

601
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:29,084
No, it gave me some names.

602
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,519
But I need to make this
bigger than just his building.

603
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:33,521
Look, I only get one hour
off a day for lunch,

604
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:35,656
and I never take it.
Do you really need me for this?

605
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,158
See these people
who are leaving the building?

606
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:39,027
Mm-hmm.

607
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,928
The entire building
looks like them.

608
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,031
I know I clean up okay, but...

609
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,533
Mm, you need me
to class you up a bit.

610
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,069
- Not class, but...
- Class.

611
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,671
All right, whatever
gets you through the door.

612
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:51,439
Come on, are you ready? Yeah.

613
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,775
Hi, there. My wife and I

614
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,277
are here to see
some of the new units.

615
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,812
Isn't that right, honey? Mmhmm.

616
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,048
So what do you think,
sweetheart?

617
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:01,783
Hm, it's fine.

618
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,985
But I like the place
on 52nd better.

619
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,721
52nd, that's
awful close to your mother.

620
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:08,590
No, no, no, we're
not talking about my mother.

621
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:10,992
Well, I... Look,
it doesn't matter to me,

622
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,227
I mean, I love
being near your mother.

623
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:15,063
I love your mother.

624
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,531
So why don't you tell us

625
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:17,798
something about

784
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:30,993
You are one of them.

785
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,261
And they're one of you.

786
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:40,202
Mike, we got work to do,
where are you?

787
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,139
Oh, I'm looking at you
right now in conference room c.

788
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,941
I'm sorry,
can you please excuse me?

789
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:48,477
Aa meeting? Here in the office?

790
00:33:48,545 --> 00:33:49,945
Funny. No, it's my lawsuit.

791
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:51,881
- Which suit is that?
- Against Johnny Karinski.

792
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,683
Between Frank's building

793
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,585
and the one Rachel and I
are about to buy into.

794
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:57,687
Oh, yeah. We're married.

795
00:33:57,755 --> 00:33:59,023
It's a long story.

796
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,791
Look, you said
think bigger, right?

797
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:03,061
I tracked down
15 former tenants

798
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,963
who are willing to testify
to all manner of harassment

799
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,198
that forced them
out of their apartments.

800
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,499
You did this overnight?

801
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,234
Yeah, I couldn't sleep anyway.

802
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:12,003
Kept thinking I felt bedbugs.

803
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,573
But I can get these people
in front of a judge

804
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,508
to tell their story,
and there is no way

805
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,511
that Vivien Tanaka can spin
this to save Karinski's ass.

806
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,281
You should hear their stories.

807
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:25,750
It'd break your heart.
Uh, if you had a heart.

808
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:27,386
Emotion is fine,

809
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:29,755
but you better have some cold,
hard facts to back it up.

810
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,823
Because Vivien Tanaka
is no pushover.

811
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:33,659
But...

812
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:36,028
It's good work. Keep at it.

813
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,996
I'm gonna go do
what I gotta go do.

814
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:48,240
[Sighs] We need more.

815
00:34:48,308 --> 00:34:49,675
[Whispers]
How're we gonna get more?

816
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:54,313
Mike?

817
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,815
Is this the building
we were in yesterday?

818
00:34:55,883 --> 00:35:00,120
No rent, no apartment.
That's my code.

819
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:03,524
Uh, yeah. Before and after.

820
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,893
[Exhales]

821
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,696
We need to go carpet shopping.

822
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,967
I see you found my ad.

823
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,269
Trying to steal
my thunder, Harvey?

824
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:16,970
Business school 101,

825
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:19,106
you have a crisis,
you acknowledge the problem.

826
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:21,641
You wanna be Tylenol,
not Toyota.

827
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,511
A little late for you
to acknowledge this is a crisis.

828
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:30,417
Ladies and gentlemen,

829
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:32,719
thank you very much
for coming here today.

830
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:35,221
Quentin Sainz placed this ad

831
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,123
because your lawsuit
made it clear

832
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,693
that his drug had side effects
that he didn't know about.

833
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:43,429
We wanted to know how
widespread this problem was.

834
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:45,866
We had an
outpouring of response.

835
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:49,670
Not from people
struggling like yourselves,

836
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:52,072
but from people desperate
to keep the drug available.

837
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:56,344
You think we're lying.

838
00:35:56,411 --> 00:35:58,345
You're here because
you think this company

839
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,047
has been hiding things
from you.

840
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:03,217
And you're right. They have.

841
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:06,086
But Quentin wants to come clean.

842
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:07,521
He wants to show you

843
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:09,256
exactly what it is
that he's been hiding.

844
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:15,462
I can't really open it.
I can't hold anything,

845
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,532
and I don't know how
much longer I can keep working.

846
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,002
It'll get better, it will.

847
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:24,037
You know it will.

848
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:27,641
I guess.

849
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,510
I bet my life on it.

850
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:37,118
It's not fair you
got ALS in the first place.

851
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,587
And it's definitely
not fair you had side effects

852
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,756
from the drug I created
and I didn't.

853
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:47,328
But now that I know they exist,
I wanna fix them.

854
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:51,766
So that people like you...

855
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,703
And maybe even you,
can have what I have right now.

856
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,472
But he can't.

857
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,641
He can't if he gives you
what you're asking.

858
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:02,643
We're not saying that
you don't deserve compensation.

859
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:05,247
Our commitment to you is this.

860
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:09,617
We are offering you partial
ownership in his company.

861
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,420
A company that is
trying to save lives.

862
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:15,323
Money isn't going
to help you live longer.

863
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,126
Taking the deal,
and letting Quentin

864
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,662
try and fix the problem could.

865
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,297
Like it or not...

866
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,967
You're all in the same boat.

867
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,935
Give Quentin the opportunity

868
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,738
to keep that boat from sinking.

869
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:50,279
They really took the offer.

870
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,982
Uh-huh, Church didn't like it.

871
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:55,050
But they didn't like Church.

872
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:57,085
They liked you. Hm.

873
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:58,954
And me.

874
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:01,756
[Chuckles] Who wouldn't?

875
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,357
Oh, your mother was
never a fan.

876
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:04,925
You wanna know the truth,

877
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:06,560
my father wasn't
much of a fan either.

878
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:09,430
Now that is a lie
and I know it.

879
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,131
Yeah. The real truth is,

880
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,833
they'd both take
you over Lisa in a minute.

881
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:24,746
I'm sorry.

882
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:27,650
I'm sorry too.

883
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:34,757
From now on...
Back to no more lies.

884
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:38,127
Well, if we're gonna do that...

885
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:41,297
You remember that time
that your jag got sideswiped

886
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:42,665
when it was
parked outside the house?

887
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,534
Yeah.

888
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,469
Yeah, it didn't
exactly go down that way.

889
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,176
I was mad. [Blusters]

890
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:53,343
- [Giggles]
- You were mad?

891
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,784
Oh, you brought a sack lunch.
We would've shared.

892
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,752
Amusing.

893
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:04,287
As was this,
your little lawsuit.

894
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:05,655
[Chuckles]

895
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,657
Take your sack of presents
and run, kid.

896
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,058
You're in way over your head.

897
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:11,060
Oh, I think he'll be just fine.

898
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:13,696
Hello, Vivien. Hello.

899
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,630
So the rookie
called in the veteran.

900
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:17,732
No, no, I'm just here to watch.

901
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,467
I love spectator sports.

902
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:22,303
You enjoy watching the Yankees
destroy a little league team?

903
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:23,838
David and goliath happens to be

904
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:25,372
one of my favorite stories.

905
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,243
Okay, I'll bite.
What's in the bag?

906
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:33,581
[Crinkling plastic]

907
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,717
- [Clears throat]
- Hey, hey, what're you doing?

908
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:37,486
Oh, do you recognize
this carpet?

909
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:39,121
Make him get that out of here.

910
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:40,890
This is your
own carpet, Mr. Karinski.

911
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,392
It's from
Frank Carvello's apartment.

912
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:46,429
Come on.
Feel the fibers, the texture,

913
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:49,365
it's almost alive.
You brought bedbugs in here.

914
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,968
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's vandalism, assault.

915
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:54,004
You know, I'm happy
that you put it that way,

916
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:56,372
because that's what we're gonna
be charging your client with.

917
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,874
What are you talking about?

918
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,744
He didn't just fail to
eradicate a bedbug infestation,

919
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,712
he actually created one.

920
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,415
Yeah, he pulled the carpet
from one of his old buildings...

921
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,084
Carpet that was already
infested...

922
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:09,519
And then he reinstalled it
in my client's apartment

923
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,722
to drive him out. That's crazy.

924
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,758
You might wanna warn
your client about perjury.

925
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:16,027
We've got sworn testimony
from the installer.

926
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:18,929
And a picture of
the same carpet

927
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,999
from one of his old buildings
before it was renovated.

928
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,235
By the way,
my wife and I really love

929
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:26,670
what you've
done with the place.

930
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,506
So it looks like
we're talking about, what?

931
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:33,177
Assault, violations of
rental codes, health codes,

932
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:36,547
and you know, just
basic codes of human decency.

933
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:38,849
And if a jury in
New York heard all that,

934
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,651
wow, imagine the damages.
Harvey...

935
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,019
Spectate, please.

936
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:43,653
Just get that carpet
out of here.

937
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,856
So, Vivien...

938
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:48,159
How am I doing for
my first time?

939
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:50,194
This still counts as
my first time, doesn't it?

940
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:55,333
Now let's talk about how much
this is going to cost you.

941
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,982
[Knocking] Yes?

942
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,350
Just thought
you'd like to know,

943
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:12,419
your case, the pro Bono...
I won.

944
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:14,555
How exciting for you.

945
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:15,922
But like I said,
it's just a pro Bono case,

946
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,291
it's not gonna help your career.

947
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:19,225
I did also manage
to sign 15 new clients

948
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,128
who are all suing
for the same harassment,

949
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,396
and they will be paying.

950
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:24,698
So you can multiply
this number...

951
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:28,168
Times 15.

952
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,435
That's not bad for
rookie league.

953
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,806
[Sighs] Come on.

954
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,208
Tell me that wasn't worth
missing your lunch hour for.

955
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,310
Mm, it makes me
proud to be your wife.

956
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:40,212
Yeah, wait,
what is that coming up?

957
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,047
Is that our third,
or our fourth anniversary?

958
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:44,316
It's our fifth.
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

959
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:46,151
Yeah. In fact, I think that

960
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,686
we should have
a date night to celebrate.

961
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:49,020
[Giggles] You're funny.

962
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,155
Hey.

963
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:53,058
I'm serious.

964
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,903
I can't date anyone
from the office.
