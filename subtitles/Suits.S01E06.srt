1
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:10,909
Harvey, I don't need
a perp walk

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,939
or a front page headline.

3
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:13,172
I just want the person
responsible.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,175
Then hand me the deal
we just negotiated

5
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,642
and justice will be served.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,142
You know what, if this were
anyone else but you,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,379
I wouldn't even be giving
the courtesy of this meeting.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,596
Becky, we're both benefiting
from this.

9
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,031
You've got nothing
on my client.

10
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,667
And I'm gonna help you get
the person responsible.

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:31,972
So let me just go do that?

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,812
You better make sure
Miss Stone signs this.

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,382
Otherwise, we don't have a deal.

14
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:37,619
How long
have we known each other?

15
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:38,720
Since you were
in the D.A.'s office.

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,358
Then you know
we'll have a deal.

17
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,368
Talk to ya.

18
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,017
How'd it go
with the Department of Justice?

19
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:56,953
Follow me, you'll find out.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,554
I get to sit in?

21
00:00:58,622 --> 00:00:59,955
With your head down
and your mouth shut.

22
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:01,557
This isn't a usual... Ah.

23
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,927
- What are you doing?
- Quick.

24
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:04,162
Act like you're telling me
something important.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,130
I am telling you
something important.

26
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,733
And then after the injunction,

27
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,505
you know, both parties decided
to reassess...

28
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,640
my God.

29
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:11,974
That woman with Rachel,

30
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:13,677
I took the LSATs for her
a couple years ago.

31
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:14,946
If she saw me,
she could blow my cover.

32
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:17,082
Oh, really?
And how would that go?

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,184
"Excuse me, when I was cheating
for my LSATs,

34
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:20,686
that was the guy
who took the test for me"?

35
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:22,189
Come on.

36
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:23,323
It could go down like that.

37
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,791
You don't know.
People say things.

38
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,194
Miss Stone, correct me
if any of this is wrong,

39
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:28,595
but you and I both know
it's not.

40
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,597
Please address me
and not my client, Mr. Specter.

41
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,432
You mean your client
who purchased $10 million

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,534
in Lunardi Pharmaceuticals

43
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,335
and then a day later

44
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:37,203
word of their FDA approval
got out

45
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,105
and the stock shot up
to $30 million?

46
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:40,373
She purchased that stock
for your clients,

47
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,941
Burt Kimball and Dean Morello,

48
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,810
based on a tip sheet
handed out by your clients.

49
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:46,146
An allegation that tainted
their reputation,

50
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:48,482
yet the D.O.J. looked into it
and found nothing.

51
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,951
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

52
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,154
I'll turn your client over
in person, no handcuffs.

53
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,590
It'll be a country club prison.

54
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,660
And I'll make sure
she's processed

55
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,295
as gently as possible
as long as she admits

56
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,097
that she made this trade
of her own accord.

57
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:02,933
It's a crappy deal
wrapped in pretty paper.

58
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,403
Why aren't we dealing
with the Department of Justice?

59
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,971
Because the D.O.J. wanted
to put you behind bars

60
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,978
for seven years, and I got 'em
down to 11 months.

61
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:13,780
Look, it's a great deal.

62
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:17,017
You're gonna sign it, you're
gonna serve your year in prison,

63
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,852
and every night when you climb
into your bunk,

64
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,220
you're gonna thank
your lucky stars

65
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,725
that Harvey Specter
negotiated on your behalf.

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,533
Nobody's ever gonna believe me,

67
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,701
and I don't have the resources

68
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,472
to fight this thing forever.

69
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,008
So I'll sign the goddamn deal.

70
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,415
But I'm not thanking anybody.

71
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,792
Harvey, you came through.

72
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,529
My company's reputation
means everything to me.

73
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,731
Thank you.

74
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:57,899
So I trust we won't be hearing

75
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,968
from the Department of Justice
again?

76
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,503
Unless you plan
on inviting them

77
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,072
to the company's
Christmas party, Bert, no.

78
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,942
I told Morello
you could fix this for us.

79
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,143
Thank you, Harvey.

80
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,249
Reality's starting to sink in.

81
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,351
Gabby's a little wound up
right now.

82
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,753
Let's give her a minute.

83
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,821
I've got the pretty papers
in my office

84
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,424
for you to look over.

85
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,393
Keep an eye on her.

86
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,238
You here to make sure
I don't change my mind

87
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:37,241
about the deal? No.

88
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,144
Would you?

89
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,915
You know,
my father was a teacher.

90
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,883
He worked hard,
followed the rules.

91
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,286
Last year, the district
cut his pension

92
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,721
to save their budget.

93
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,590
I went to Wall Street
so I could make some money

94
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:57,429
before getting
into teaching myself.

95
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,864
I never thought
I'd have to worry

96
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,233
if they let
convicted felons teach.

97
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:06,772
Can I get you some water
or something?

98
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,280
Oh...

99
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,348
I'm just gonna get you
some water.

100
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,522
Hey. I got it.

101
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,223
Thanks.

102
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,260
So that girl
you were with earlier,

103
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,462
she a friend of yours?
Theresa, yeah.

104
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,130
She used to be a paralegal here.

105
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,965
We were pretty close.

106
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,266
She worked at Pearson, Hardman?

107
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,701
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,703
And I just had the unique
pleasure of giving her

109
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,272
the summer intern tour
for prospective employees.

110
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,473
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,708
She's in her second year
of Harvard Law,

112
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,176
meeting with the partners
as we speak.

113
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,945
- Huh.
- I know.

114
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:46,613
We used to do everything
together.

115
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:50,183
And now, if she gets this job,
she will technically be my boss.

116
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:51,685
Oh, God.

117
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:52,953
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

118
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,455
Do you need to talk about it?

119
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:57,157
No. Not now. Thanks.

120
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,225
Oh, no, no. No.

121
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:00,328
What?

122
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,863
She's gone.

You left her alone

00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:36,771
to get her a water?

136
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,072
What, she didn't want a latte?

137
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,407
I was trying to be helpful.

138
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:41,343
You were very helpful to her.

139
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,543
You didn't see her, Harvey.
She was scared.

140
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,011
She was a wreck.

141
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,179
Maybe that had to do
with the fact that she was about

142
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,781
to go to prison for 11 months.

143
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,383
I think she was having the
reaction of an innocent woman.

144
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,684
And what was telling you that?

145
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,219
Your years
of investigative experience?

146
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,922
You know, I just... I listened
to her, that's all.

147
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,424
Let me tell you something,
okay.

148
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,591
Just because a pretty girl
tells you a story

149
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,193
doesn't mean it's true.

150
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,594
If she'd gone to trial,

151
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:01,163
the burden of proof would be
on the prosecution,

152
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,530
yet her own lawyer

153
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:03,898
told her to take the deal.

154
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,300
Not to mention
that innocent people

155
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:09,003
don't run.

156
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,872
I think this fell out
of her purse.

157
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,641
I found it here.

158
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,777
Why are you
telling me this now?

159
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:17,145
Because you were mad
at me before.

160
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,447
So your answer to that

161
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,248
is to delay giving me
important information?

162
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,884
Well, when you put it
like that.

163
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,053
Okay, I got to smooth things
over with the D.O.J.

164
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,989
That phone is our only lead.

165
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,858
Try not to lose it
before I get back.

166
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,126
Okay?

167
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:40,936
Becky, there's been
a slight hiccup

168
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:42,370
on the Gabby Stone business.

169
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:43,472
I don't want to hear
about any hiccups.

170
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,673
Did she sign the deal or not?

171
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,174
Well, she was about to.

172
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:48,143
My associate left her alone
for a second,

173
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,811
and she took off.

174
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,146
Gabby Stone's in the wind?

175
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:54,482
"In the wind"? Really?

176
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,184
The woman
isn't a world-class felon.

177
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,052
She'll turn up.

178
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Well, it better be soon,
or the deal's off the table

179
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,923
and I'm going
after your clients.

180
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,091
That's funny.

181
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,492
I don't think so.

182
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,260
The SEC decided
they had no case,

183
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,795
and their burden of proof
is lower.

184
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,563
If you had something
on my clients,

185
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,932
you would have charged them
already.

186
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,467
Harvey, I went out
on a limb for you.

187
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:14,969
You make me look bad on this,

188
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:19,039
I promise you,
you'll regret it.

189
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,909
Donna, where the hell's Mike?

190
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,446

191
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,622

194
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:43,898
Hey, anyone know a guy
named Bradley?

195
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,299
Ball!

196
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,436
The guy's who about to miss
the jumper.

197
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,205
Do you have a last name?

198
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:51,507
Brickstein.

199
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:53,109
Do I look
like I have time for jokes?

200
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:57,213
Reger.

201
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,151
Bradley.

202
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:07,822
Mr. Reger.

203
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,323
- Ohh.
- Come on, Reger.

204
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:11,592
Bradley Reger!

205
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,130
Sorry, can I help you?

206
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:19,668
I'm sure you've heard
about the investigation

207
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,572
regarding Gabby Stone.

208
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,773
Are you
with the Department of Justice?

209
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,543
I...

210
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:30,146
I have several questions
for you.

211
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,849
Did you help Gabby
when she was charged

212
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,185
with insider trading?

213
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,653
Of course I did.

214
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,788
She wasn't just a trader.
She was my friend.

215
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,523
I recommended a lawyer
and let her borrow some cash

216
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:42,558
after you guys
froze her account.

217
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,759
That was Henderson.

218
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,394
He's a stickler for procedure.

219
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,562
Tell me, when was the last time
you saw her?

220
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,865
Bradley, let me inform you

221
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,433
that withholding knowledge
of the whereabouts

222
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,402
of a known fugitive
is a federal offense.

223
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,071
Do you understand me?

224
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,539
Gabby came in here
20 minutes ago.

225
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,675
She asked to borrow my keycard
to Morello Assets offices,

226
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,043
and I gave it to her.

227
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,780
Well, the department
appreciates your honesty.

228
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,482
Oh, and, Mr. Reger, put
a little arc in your jump shot,

229
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,816
all right?
If poor shooting were a crime,

230
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,384
I'd be forced to arrest you
right here.

231
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:10,853
It's embarrassing.

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,987
Go get 'em.

233
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,997
Harvey, I know where she is.

234
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,602
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd get her.

235
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,170
And I would let you.

236
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,772
I just wanted to make sure
she didn't get away again.

237
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,141
The water was right
outside the room, okay?

238
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,443
And you said innocent people
don't run.

239
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,578
Do guilty people run back
to the scene of the crime?

240
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,013
You don't know
what she's doing.

241
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,981
She could be planning
on taking a baseball bat

242
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,549
to all these computers
for all we know.

243
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:50,357
Gabby, what are you doing?

244
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,725
That stock was on my tip sheet.

245
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,226
It was on mine.

246
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,429
If I could find that tip sheet,

247
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,397
I could prove my innocence.

248
00:09:57,465 --> 00:10:01,569
Is this what guilty people do?

249
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,237
I know they're your clients,

250
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,605
but can you help me, please?

251
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:05,773
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,274
You can either come with us,

253
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,944
or we'll have the Department
of Justice bring you in.

254
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,654
So I meant to ask you,

255
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,389
how did your friend's interview
go yesterday?

256
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,025
Theresa?
She didn't get the internship.

257
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,427
So how do you feel about that?

258
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,062
To be honest, I'm relieved.

259
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,597
I mean, she would have been
a daily reminder

260
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,031
of what I couldn't do,

261
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,166
that I'll never score
high enough

262
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,668
on the LSATs
or get into law school.

263
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,604
You know,
that doesn't have to be true.

264
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,239
It is. I need to accept

265
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,540
that I will always be
a paralegal

266
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,008
because of this stupid test.

267
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,789
I had a hard time
sleeping last night.

268
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,057
You want to know why? No.

269
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,525
Because Gabby Stone
is innocent.

270
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,194
Oh, I slept like a baby.

271
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,461
I don't think you believe that.

272
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,029
You think she's innocent too.

273
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:03,164
You just don't want
to pursue it.

274
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:04,364
She's not our client.

275
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,300
No, Morello is our client.

276
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,501
And if someone else
in that office is responsible

277
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,570
and they do it again,
won't that put our client

278
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:11,771
in jeopardy?

279
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,573
Ahh. Ooh, yep.

280
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,008
I'm right, and you know it.

281
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,643
And now you have
the responsibility

282
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,547
to investigate.

283
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,616
Did you tell that guy
at the basketball court

284
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,719
that you were an attorney
for the Department of Justice?

285
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,891
Not explicitly.

286
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,893
I mean, people hear
what they want to hear.

287
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,796
I won't impersonate
a federal agent again.

288
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:35,932
Probably a good idea.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,002
Yeah.

290
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,428
Oh, hey, Mike, can I give you

291
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,063
my roommate's cat
for the weekend?

292
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,965
Let's get it over with.
I have some actual work to do.

293
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,300
No, no, no,
it's not what you think.

294
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,768
It's just very annoying,

295
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,236
and I figured
if you were looking after it,

296
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,604
the cat's as good as gone,
right?

297
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,873
Gentlemen.

298
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,374
What's going on?

299
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,810
Some sort of shenanigans?

300
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:07,278
Uh, no, it's nothing.

301
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:09,046
It's just stuff
between associates.

302
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,314
I said, "What's going on?"

303
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:13,184
Seth's just giving me
a hard time

304
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,787
for losing Gabby Stone
yesterday.

305
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,055
Oh, but we know at this firm

306
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,291
that we don't dwell
on our colleagues' mistakes,

307
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,826
right?

308
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,394
I mean, just because one

309
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:25,429
of your fellow associates
is incompetent doesn't mean

310
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,730
you have to constantly remind
this moron

311
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,433
what a careless idiot
he really is, right?

312
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,936
You.

313
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,108
Harold, I called you
two nights ago,

314
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,009
and you didn't answer
your phone,

315
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,477
which is really funny,

316
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:42,078
because you're
a first-year associate,

317
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,646
who's lucky enough
to be working here

318
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:46,315
at Pearson/Hardroao, so, when
I need to get a hold of you,

319
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,618
you will be reachable
at all times.

320
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,153
I don't care
if you're in a coma,

321
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,654
hospital
that's been burning down,

322
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:53,389
your mother's about to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge,

323
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,690
you will pick up your phone.

324
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:55,958
- Absolutely.
- Got it?

325
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,126
Yes.

326
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,596
Okay, thanks.
Can you leave my office, please?

327
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,472
Harvey, once this whole
Morello thing gets fixed,

328
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,208
remind me to be irritated
with you for not billing more

329
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,077
on the Swindon merger.

330
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:17,313
The fact is mergers
are boring, okay?

331
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,582
Plus, I'm busy. Also, mergers?

332
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:20,816
Boring.

333
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,385
How'd you get these?

334
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,788
Oh, you mean tickets to
the Royal Shakespeare Company's

335
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:25,756
production of <i>King Lear?</i>

336
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,090
This show was sold out

337
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:28,091
the minute these tickets
went on sale.

338
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,492
I live for <i>King Lear.</i>

339
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,995
- How did you know that?
- It's my job to know that.

340
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,263
But why?

341
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:36,200
Louis, your billables
are outstanding.

342
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:39,103
You've landed
three high-profile clients

343
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,872
in a month, and I want
to show you my appreciation.

344
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,808
And I'm very happy
that you're excited.

345
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,909
So should we get dinner
before or after the play?

346
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,147
Uh, um, I-I don't know.

347
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,582
Jessica, do you remember
when we went

348
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,050
to that Yankee game
and you caught that foul ball

349
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,618
and you ate all my nachos?

350
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,053
Did we go to the steakhouse
that night?

351
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,955
Oh, that was a good meal.

352
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:01,625
That was fun.

353
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,627
Have a good time.

354
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:06,663
You know what, Louis,
dinner after.

355
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,331
I'll have Norma
make a reservation.

356
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,101
Fantastic.

357
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,711
Dean, Gabby Stone's
still making noises

358
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,014
about these tip sheets.

359
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,882
She insists that she had
a different sheet

360
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,183
on the day she bought Lunardi.

361
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,585
She was lying.

362
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,620
I understand,
but, after she broke

363
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,755
into your offices last night,

364
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:33,123
the D.O.J. might be inclined

365
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,660
to start rattling cases again.

366
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,262
So, for the record,

367
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,396
you're telling me the truth,
right?

368
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,599
Harvey,

369
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,000
you work for me, remember?

370
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:44,868
Well, as your lawyer,
I need to be able

371
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:46,770
to tell the D.O.J.
we're all aboveboard.

372
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:48,338
- Of course.
- So you won't mind

373
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,339
if I look around for myself?

374
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,673
We've had a clean record

375
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,142
for 50 years.

376
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,479
Please, Harvey, look around.

377
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,283
Why is that on my desk?

378
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,519
'Cause the LSATs are a week
from Saturday.

379
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,387
Great. Go away. I'm busy.

380
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,122
There are only four tests
a year, which means,

381
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,423
if you miss this one,
you're gonna have to wait

382
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,524
another three months.
I can do math too,

383
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,160
Good Will Hunting.

384
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,196
When did I say I was ready
to retake the LSATs?

385
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,531
I thought that,
after our talk...

386
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:15,665
Nothing about our talk
said I'm interested

387
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:16,800
in bombing the test again.

388
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,168
You're not gonna bomb it again.

389
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,702
- How do you know?
- Because the first time

390
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,703
you took it, you were missing

391
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,371
one essential ingredient...

392
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:23,606
Me.

393
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,740
Not interested.

394
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,246
If I let you help me,

395
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,380
will you leave me alone?

396
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,782
Mm-hmm.

397
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,651
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

398
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,619
Get excited.

399
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:42,557
Whoo-hoo.

400
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,493
Hey, I forget, why are we
looking into Gabby Stone again?

401
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,395
Oh, right,
because I said she's innocent,

402
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:48,663
and now you agree with me.

403
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:49,731
No, I don't agree with you

404
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,265
that she's innocent,

405
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,400
but, if there's even
the slightest chance

406
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,869
that someone else is involved,

407
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:56,870
they're putting
the whole company at risk,

408
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:58,238
and I can't have that.

409
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:01,307
Okay, so you disagree
with what we agree about?

410
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,642
Oh, I'll agree with that.

411
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,616
I don't feel sorry
for Gabby Stone at all.

412
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,617
Because?

413
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,651
I found her.

414
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,086
I was her immediate supervisor.

415
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:13,522
I nurtured her.

416
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,924
Then she tries to cheat
and give us a bad name.

417
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,959
How commonplace would you say
cheating is here?

418
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,095
It's not. It's not the kind
of shop we run.

419
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,931
So when Miss Stone
made the trade

420
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,365
and the investment tripled
in value,

421
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,633
you weren't suspicious?

422
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:25,601
My job's not to worry
about the traders

423
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,135
that are making money.

424
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,806
My job's to worry
about the traders who aren't.

425
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,637
So how exactly
does the tip sheet system work?

426
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,605
Our technical analyst
predicts stocks

427
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,907
that are likely to have
larger-than-expected volatility.

428
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,842
These predictions are handed out
to our traders

429
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,711
on a daily basis in the form
of a tip sheet.

430
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,114
All these traders
get the same tip sheet?

431
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:14,081
Exactly.
They're printed on red paper,

432
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:15,382
so they can't be copied.

433
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,917
Every trader is responsible
for returning

434
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:18,719
their sheet
at the end of the day,

435
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,253
so they can be shredded.
So no records exist?

436
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:21,655
We keep electronic copies.

437
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,389
I'll need to see those copies
for the last year.

438
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:24,524
I thought you might.

439
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:25,992
I'm assuming you own a computer.

440
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,493
One more thing.

441
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:28,728
I'll need to see a list
of all the trades.

442
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,329
Morello Assets made
in the last year.

443
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,865
Well, I can't give you that.

444
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,066
Why not?

445
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,101
Tip sheets have expired.

446
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,672
But our current positions...
that's proprietary information.

447
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,674
And I can't release that
on just your say-so.

448
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:42,942
That's not a request.

449
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,410
We need to protect the company.

450
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,845
And we're covered
under attorney-client privilege.

451
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:48,381
And I'm telling you
I'm not giving you sh...

452
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:51,150
You think I don't know what
attorney-client privilege is?

453
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:53,587
You know, you corporate lawyers
look down your noses at us

454
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:55,655
because we didn't go
to Ivy League schools.

455
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,624
Just because I don't have
a fancy degree

456
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,825
doesn't mean you get
to come into my house

457
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:00,393
and order me around.

458
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,761
And you go whine to Morello

459
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:04,830
and I'll knock you on your ass
like the pussy you are.

460
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:08,468
Well, Sam, I'm sorry
that you feel that way,

461
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:10,604
but I've been working
for your boss Dean Morello

462
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:11,738
for a very long time,

463
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,373
and let me tell you something.

464
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,142
You try to stonewall me,

465
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,378
you'll be out on the street
in less than a week.

466
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:18,780
As for the other stuff,

467
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,250
do I think
that I'm smarter than you?

468
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,584
You're damn right I do.

469
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:24,487
But if you think that means

470
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:27,256
that I can't kick your ass
up and down this floor,

471
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:30,159
take a swing
and see what happens.

472
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,365
I didn't think so.

473
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,103
That was amazing.

474
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,672
It was like he was Mr. T
and you were Rocky,

475
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,974
but not like Rocky at the
beginning when he was all scared

476
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,076
of Mr. T, but at the end,

477
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,410
when he was all like,

478
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:48,912
"Ooh, give it your best shot."

479
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,146
You know?

480
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,682
"Adrian!" Yes!

481
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,884
That's funny, but you might
want to wipe that grin

482
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:55,986
off your face. What? Why?

483
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,554
Because without those trades,

484
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,122
we don't have sh...,
and your little girlfriend's

485
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,490
gonna rot in jail.

486
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,424
And by the way, you got to work
on your Stallone.

487
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:02,792
You need a lower register.

488
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,361
"Uhh."

489
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,062
That was
an incredible Stallone.

490
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,831
I've been doing that since I was
a kid, and you can't touch it.

491
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,199
- "Uhh."
- Don't do that

492
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,500
with food in your mouth.
No, I swallowed it.

493
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,103
"Uhh."
There's food in your mouth.

494
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,337
- "Adrian."
- That's disgusting.

495
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,842
Come on. You got this one.

496
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,078
It's "A".

497
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,247
No, it's "C".

498
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:24,982
Actually, it's "D".
It's definitely "D".

499
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,450
Final answer?

500
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:28,785
Yes, "D".

501
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,186
It's "A".

502
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:33,189
Rachel, you got to remember

503
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,124
they're asking why the argument
is most vulnerable.

504
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,593
I can make the case

505
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,927
that they're
all vulnerable arguments.

506
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,662
You could, but your
first instinct was "A".

507
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,830
You got to go with your gut.
Right.

508
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:42,231
So what if my gut can find

509
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,332
the exception
where "A" is wrong.

510
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,366
What am I supposed to do then?

511
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,534
- You ignore it.
- I can't.

512
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,502
That's easier said than done.

513
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,004
The test isn't trying

514
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,740
to trick you, Rachel.
But sometimes it is, Mike.

515
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,642
- Well, you got to let that go.
- I can't.

516
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,610
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want

517
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:56,181
to get any questions wrong.

518
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,150
Okay.
I think we found your problem.

519
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,986
You're so afraid of getting
fooled by a few trick questions

520
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,421
that you're letting it mess
you up with all the other ones.

521
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,456
Look, Rachel, you want
to get into Harvard,

522
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,591
you need a 170. Okay?

523
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,960
If you let a few
of these trick questions go,

524
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,561
you're gonna be fine.

525
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,697
But if you keep trying
to be perfect,

526
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:13,832
you're gonna overthink
this whole thing.

527
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,134
You're gonna end up with a 130.

528
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,968
Rachel.

529
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:19,904
Nobody gets
all the trick questions.

530
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,539
What about you?

531
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:23,941
First grade,

532
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,943
they gave me
an achievement test.

533
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,145
I scored in the 99th percentile,

534
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,214
so they kept giving me
achievement tests

535
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:32,850
all the way up
to the eighth grade level.

536
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:35,186
And I kept getting
in the 99th percentile

537
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,088
with every one of 'em.

538
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,091
You couldn't get the 100th?

539
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,294
There is no 100th.

540
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:47,933
Next question. Come on.

541
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,434
<i>King Lear.</i>

542
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:50,902
I happen to like <i>King Lear.</i>

543
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,938
And unlike some people I know,

544
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,641
Louie's references don't begin
and end with <i>Top Gun.</i>

545
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,509
Hey, I love Louis,
and I don't care

546
00:20:57,577 --> 00:21:00,412
what you say,
I am not leaving my wingman.

547
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,781
See, that's funny,
because that's from <i>Top Gun.</i>

548
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:06,418
He's a wild card.
Flies by the seat of his pants.

549
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:08,888
Think I can't quote <i>Top Gun.</i>

550
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:10,089
Get the hell out of here.

551
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:11,390
Oh, that was good.

552
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,393
Hey, Mike.

553
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,694
Burt Kimball's coming
to see me.

554
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:15,895
I need you in the meeting.

555
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,197
Oh, the number two at Morello?

556
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:18,732
Bet he's coming to yell at you

557
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,601
after your big showdown there
yesterday.

558
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:21,936
If you need me,
I got your back.

559
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:25,073
Thinking about finally going
to law school?

560
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:27,409
Oh, no,
I'm helping Rachel study.

561
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:28,843
Pretty paralegal. Got it.

562
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:30,545
Okay. It's not like that.

563
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,047
It's exactly like that.

564
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,482
Oh, that reminds me.

565
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,884
How did you manage
to take the LSATs for a woman?

566
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,019
What do you mean?

567
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,587
We took the test the same day.

568
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:40,422
She signed my name on hers,
and I signed hers on mine.

569
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,091
Why? What's so funny?

570
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:45,194
I just pictured you in drag.

571
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,895
I could pull that off.

572
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:50,399
I've got soft features.

573
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,134
I want to apologize
for Samuel's behavior.

574
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:54,503
He's had a chip on his shoulder

575
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,737
ever since
the Department of Justice

576
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,239
investigated Miss Stone's
malfeasance.

577
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:00,175
He's very protective
of the firm.

578
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:01,943
That's a good man
to have in your corner.

579
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:04,146
Well, so are you.

580
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:05,948
In these folders, you'll find

581
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:08,917
every trade made by Morello
Assets in the last year.

582
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,786
Personally delivered by
Burt Kimball, I'm flattered.

583
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,721
Well, we just want to make sure

584
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,856
you've got everything you need,
Harvey.

585
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,157
We really appreciate
your diligence.

586
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,192
Now I better get back
to the office.

587
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,195
The Australian markets
are just opening up.

588
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:23,664
Good to see you.
Always a pleasure, Burt.

589
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:27,702
Harvey, this is great.

590
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,238
We can take
these tip sheets and put them...

591
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,305
what are you doing?

592
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,640
This guy's not that friendly

593
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,875
to his own mother.

594
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:36,544
He's hiding something,
and I'm pissed.

595
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:37,945
What are you talking about?

596
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,681
Those aren't the real trades.

597
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:43,251
Okay. So how do we get them?

598
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,756
Right. How do I get them?

599
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,057
Hmm.

600
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:58,837
Hello?

601
00:22:58,838 --> 00:22:59,445
You figure out how to get

602
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,546
the most profitable trades yet,
Mike?

603
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,781
The Morello brokers hang out
at a bar

604
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:02,882
called the Closing Bell.

605
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,241
I'm on my way now. Good.

606
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:06,742
Just remember you're working.
I'll talk to you later.

00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,470
Oh, man. You know, you drink

that beer any slower,
I'm gonna have

Vince Landis, Morello asset.

Yeah, that's me.

622
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,278
Yeah. Russell Ginther.

623
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:19,680
The Ginth.

624
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,281
The Ginthesizer.

625
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:23,049
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, Gervich Investments.

626
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:25,217
Man, we got shithoused here
a couple weeks ago.

627
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,585
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

628
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,888
You, me, Pepiol, Causwell,

629
00:24:28,956 --> 00:24:30,289
Williamson.

630
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,425
That guy, dick.
You still owe me 20 bucks.

631
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,327
Yeah, right. Russell.

632
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:36,495
- Right, Russell.
- You still begging for scraps

633
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:37,463
over there at Gervich or what?

634
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:38,898
You wish.

635
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:41,600
Hey, I need a shot.
What is this?

636
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,636
No, drink mine, please.

637
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:45,238
Mm. Jaeger?

638
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:46,372
You're better than that, man.

639
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,713
Money!

640
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:59,420
God, you guys are a bunch
of pussies.

641
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:02,590
I guarantee you
my biggest trades kick the ass

642
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:03,591
out of your biggest trades.

643
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,192
I don't think so, brother.

644
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,031
Last month, I made $2 million
on Cahill Metal in one hour.

645
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,265
$2 million?

646
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,767
I made $4 million
off of Montroluxx

647
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:13,801
back in February.

648
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,336
That stock tripled over night.

649
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:16,737
What's up? $4 million?

650
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,171
Oh, that's adorable.

651
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:20,107
How about the $6 million
I just cleared

652
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,541
on Rypien Micro Devices.

653
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,710
Oh, yeah?
What do you think my boy here

654
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,245
made on Piper Web Systems?
What, this guy?

655
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:26,780
- Right here.
- Uh-huh.

656
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:28,215
Uh, I don't know.
A pack of chewing gum

657
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,651
and your sister's panties.

658
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:35,289
Oh, it's on.

659
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:37,958
Ohh!

660
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:39,993
Vince Landis! $7 million off

661
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,861
of Drogin Limited.

662
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:44,097
$8 million off of Epling RTX.

663
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:48,201
$9 million off
of RMA Integrated Products.

664
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,537
Well, gentlemen, greed is good.

665
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,705
So is his sister. Right?

666
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,841
Come on, man.
That's his sister.

667
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,442
That's not cool.

668
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,910
Dude, you just made,
like, the same joke.

669
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:00,446
Aahh!

670
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:06,586
Hey, Bradley's finally here.

671
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:09,088
Uh, all right, ladies.
Listen, I got to split.

672
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:10,590
It's been real.

673
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:11,791
I'll get drinks next time,
all right?

674
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,427
- Right.
- Make money, money, make money.

675
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,095
♪ ♪

676
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,814
Ah.

677
00:26:35,418 --> 00:26:38,053
Harvey. I got the trades.

678
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:39,988
Good. We'll talk tomorrow.

679
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,223
What? No. I'm coming over now.

680
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,558
You're drunk. Do not come over.

681
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,762
All right. Cool.
I'll see you in a minute.

682
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,931
Hey.

683
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,466
Harvey, come on.

684
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:51,868
We got to save Gabby.

685
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:53,903
Gabrilini.

686
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:57,274
Oh.
Oh, you got a sweet place, dude.

687
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:59,343
Don't ever call me dude.

688
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,245
Do you think that maybe
I could take it off your hands,

689
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:03,815
like, when you go out of town?

690
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:05,349
Like a house-sitting-type
situation?

691
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,551
Remind me to have Donna
get you a spare key.

692
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,053
You have the trades?

693
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
Tada.

694
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:12,022
Good.

695
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,690
Hey, when can we...

696
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,225
I'm still upset that
I didn't get the internship.

697
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:16,593
It would have been so much fun
to work together,

698
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,762
don't you think?
Oh, absolutely.

699
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,664
Let me ask you something.

700
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:25,067
How did you turn it around
with the LSATs?

701
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,169
What do you mean?

702
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:28,071
Well, come on.

703
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:29,573
You took 'em,
didn't do so well,

704
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:30,807
and now you're at Harvard Law.

705
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,377
It's exactly what I want
to be doing.

706
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,578
So you can tell me.

707
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,347
What'd you do,
sleep with the grader?

708
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,650
What?

709
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:46,290
I paid someone
to take them for me.

710
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:52,029
What?

711
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:53,030
There's this guy.

712
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,499
I heard about him

713
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,068
from a friend of a friend's.

714
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,503
Paid him 1,000 bucks

715
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,838
and he took the LSATs for me.

716
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,273
He got me a 172.

717
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,642
You cheated on the LSATs?

718
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,611
When we were paralegals,
we were smarter

719
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:07,845
than half the associates.

720
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:10,115
Why should I be denied
my chance

721
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:11,883
because I can't pass
some stupid test?

722
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,653
I'm living my dream, Rache.

723
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:16,556
I'm not gonna apologize for it
to anyone.

724
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,097
Come on. Come on.

725
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,804
Hello?

726
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,505
Mikey, yo, it's Scott.

727
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:33,641
Scott? How are you, man?

728
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,643
I haven't talked to you
in forever.

729
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:38,179
Are you still taking LSATs
for other people?

730
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:40,548
I got a customer for you.

731
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:41,950
No, man.

732
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:43,519
I'm not in that business
anymore.

733
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:45,020
I'm sorry. Trust me.

734
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:47,056
You want to take
this meeting, dude.

735
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:50,226
This chick is smoking hot.

736
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,794
What's her name?

737
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:54,631
Rachel Zane.

738
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,165
You didn't give her my name,
did you?

739
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,134
No. Of course not.

740
00:28:58,202 --> 00:28:59,770
I'm not taking
that meeting, man.

741
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,058
What do you want me
to sign now?

742
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,359
A confession
that I killed Kennedy?

743
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:33,561
I'm not gonna pretend

744
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:34,575
to be your best friend,
Miss Stone.

745
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:36,442
But my interests happen to be
aligned with yours right now,

746
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,344
so please sit down.

747
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,651
Your colleagues'
most profitable trades.

748
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,820
Why are you showing them to me?

749
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,022
Every single one of them
comes from stocks

750
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,325
that Morello Assets
didn't officially recommend.

751
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:53,727
This is either a hell
of a coincidence,

752
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:56,197
or these traders were all given
different tip sheets.

753
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,765
So you believe me when I said

754
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,733
my tip sheet had
Lunardi Pharmaceuticals on it.

755
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,335
Well, I'm getting there,

756
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,403
but you got flagged
by the D.O.J.

757
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,805
And no one else at Morello did,

758
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,005
so I want to know why.

759
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:09,408
What's different here?

760
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,610
None of these trades
are for more than $9 million.

761
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,412
That's Morello's
recommended amount.

762
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,148
And your Lunardi purchase
was for $10 million.

763
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:19,352
Maybe someone figured out
that any trade under $10 million

764
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,687
wouldn't draw D.O.J. attention.

765
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:23,257
Why'd you make a trade
for $1 million more

766
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:24,825
than the recommended amount?

767
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:26,994
Look at me.

768
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:30,031
I'm not exactly
fraternity material.

769
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,733
It's a cutthroat world,

770
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:34,069
and I wasn't performing well.

771
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:37,805
So I took a chance,
and I tried to hit it big.

772
00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:40,041
I picked the wrong trade.

773
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:43,110
Gabby, if you knew
you were innocent,

774
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:44,979
then why didn't you fight this
harder?

775
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,184
After I saw how much money
the trade made,

776
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:52,420
I suspected something.

777
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:53,921
I went to Burt Kimball,

778
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:57,057
he reassured me that I made
a profitable trade

779
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,325
and did nothing wrong.

780
00:30:58,393 --> 00:31:01,763
He even told me
I had a $300,000 bonus

781
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,066
coming at the end
of the quarter.

782
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,301
I should have gone to someone,

783
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:10,305
said something.

784
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:13,442
I made one mistake,

785
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,944
and I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

786
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:23,118
Scott. Yeah, it's Mike Ross.

787
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:27,390
This Rachel Zane,
tell her I'll take the meeting.

788
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,159
Just don't tell her my name.

789
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:30,961
Who's that on the phone?

790
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:35,432
It's nothing.

791
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:46,578
You thinking about Gabby?

792
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:49,113
I'm thinking about her lawyer.

793
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:50,948
- What?
- Knowing what she said,

794
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,716
why would that Zegan guy
agree to a deal

795
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:55,118
that puts his client behind bars
without even putting up a fight?

796
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:56,720
I can't stand
that kind of shoddy work.

797
00:31:56,788 --> 00:31:58,555
It's like the bad version
of both of us.

798
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:00,624
He doesn't care about his client
and he's not about winning.

799
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:02,492
He's got even less style
than you.

800
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
I don't really see
how that's relevant.

801
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:04,861
Like at all. Hold on.

802
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:06,029
How did she get this lawyer?

803
00:32:06,097 --> 00:32:07,530
Her friend Bradley.

804
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:08,898
The one who also works
at Morello?

805
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,499
Yeah.

806
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,267
I don't think Bradley's
as good a friend

807
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,435
as she thinks he is.

808
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:15,870
Here's what you're gonna do.

809
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,842
I looked into it.
You were right.

810
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,377
Put this together fast.

811
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,379
I care about Gabby.

812
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:27,282
You were right too.

813
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,919
You want me to go with you?

814
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:34,957
I'm sorry, but I got
to take care of this one myself.

815
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:45,568
Hot dogs, hamburgers.

816
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:47,371
- Thank you.
- Hot dogs, hamburgers.

817
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:50,107
Rachel?

818
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,208
What are you doing
all the way over here?

819
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:55,011
This guy has
the best soft pretzels in town.

820
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,046
Do you want to try it?

821
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:57,314
No, I'm good.

822
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:59,215
Hey, how are you feeling
about the LSATs?

823
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:01,117
I was really happy with all
the prep we did yesterday.

824
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,285
I'm really excited for you.

825
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,586
You're excited for me?

826
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:05,621
Why do you even care?
Hot dogs, hamburgers.

827
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,089
- I was just asking.
- Well, just stop asking.

828
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:09,158
Look, I came down here

829
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,492
because I just want
to be by myself

830
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,893
and I bump into you,
and the first thing

831
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,729
you want to talk about
is the LSATs.

832
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,365
Hey, sorry.

833
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:19,402
The truth is, I came down here
to clear my head too.

834
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:20,770
About what?

835
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:22,072
Gabby Stone.

836
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:23,473
The girl who did
the insider trading?

837
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,375
She actually suspected
that something was wrong

838
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:27,578
after the trade, but she didn't
do anything about it.

839
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,346
She didn't want
to jeopardize her career.

840
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,215
Now she's gonna be paying

841
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:34,017
for that mistake
for the rest of her life.

842
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:36,453
Anyway, I'm sorry
I ruined your alone time.

843
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,022
I'll see you back at the office.

844
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:46,028
Let me ask you something, Nick.

845
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,330
Does Burt Kimball drag his feet
paying you too?

846
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:49,698
Excuse me?

847
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,233
'Cause in my experience,
getting money

848
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:53,502
from that asshole is like
getting blood from a stone.

849
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,870
I don't know
what you're talking about.

850
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,071
Yes, you do.

851
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:57,673
See, after I saw your client

852
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,310
sitting in jail,
I got to wondering.

853
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,179
How'd she find you?

854
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:03,980
- I'm gonna call security.
- Absolutely.

855
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:06,016
See, it turns out
that her friend Bradley

856
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,318
recommended you.

857
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:08,886
Bradley, who's been
at Morello Assets

858
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:10,188
for the past seven years.

859
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,090
So I checked.

860
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:14,558
You know what I found?

861
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:15,960
You represented Burt Kimball

862
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,828
in a civil suit 12 years ago.

863
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,096
It just so happens
you also represented.

864
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:25,468
Lunardi Pharmaceuticals in
their FDA approval proceedings.

865
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:26,902
That doesn't mean anything.

866
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,837
You've seen my relationship
with the D.O.J.

867
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:30,072
Want me to point them
in your direction?

868
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,973
Or do you want to admit to me

869
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,809
that Burt Kimball's
paying you off?

870
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:51,268
Harvey,

871
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,170
I don't understand.

872
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,506
I thought all this business
was done with.

873
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:56,808
It's almost sorted out, Dean.

874
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,042
I'm just here to let you know

875
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,343
that Burt's a crook.

876
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:00,811
What did you say?

877
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:01,812
Harvey.

878
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,913
He used a lawyer

879
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,114
to periodically provide him

880
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,148
with insider information.

881
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,584
Once he got this information,

882
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:10,686
he handed out one tip sheet
different from all the others,

883
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:13,088
so the trader, in this instance,
Gabrielle Stone,

884
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,790
would make a trade not knowing

885
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,491
that she was acting
on an illegal tip.

886
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,660
It was actually ingenious.

887
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:20,663
If the trade
was ever under suspicion,

888
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,265
even the trader couldn't point
to Burt.

889
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:24,334
We've heard more than enough,
thank you.

890
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:25,535
I don't think so.

891
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:27,371
Miss Stone made two mistakes.

892
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:30,007
One, she made a trade
for more than $9 million.

893
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:32,410
And the other was not going
to the D.O.J.

894
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,778
the second the stock shot up
through the roof.

895
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,714
You son of a bitch.

896
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,783
Harvey, this is a lot
to digest.

897
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:39,919
Well, I'll make it easy
for you, Dean.

898
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,720
He's a cancer.

899
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,856
You don't cut him loose, he's
gonna kill your whole company.

900
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,557
How dare you walk in here

901
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,359
and accuse me with these things?

902
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,529
I mean, you are my lawyer.

903
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:52,731
No, Burt, I'm the lawyer
for Morello Asset Management.

904
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,700
As far as the law is concerned,

905
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:55,801
Dean Morello's my client,
not you.

906
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:57,269
Dumb son of a bitch.

907
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:59,105
Burt, you're fired.

908
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:00,206
What?

909
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,707
Effective immediately.

910
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:03,209
You're gonna fire me?
Because of this?

911
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,612
I hope you're happy.

912
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,382
'Cause without me,
this hedge fund's nothing.

913
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,917
I'll be happy
when the Department of Justice

914
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,552
puts your ass in handcuffs.

915
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,788
Enjoy your freedom, Burt,
because they're coming for you.

916
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:17,624
And since you're a bigger trophy
than Gabrielle Stone,

917
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:20,894
you're gonna get a whole lot
more than 11 months.

918
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,631
Harvey, I want you to know

919
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:28,867
that I knew nothing
about any of this.

920
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:32,203
Dean, when I was 13 years old,

921
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:34,305
my little brother
was getting bullied by a kid

922
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,607
in the neighborhood.

923
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,675
One day, I confronted
the kid's father.

924
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,477
He told me he didn't know
anything about it.

925
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:42,647
You know what his problem was?

926
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:46,284
It was his goddamn job to know.

927
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:58,396
Thanks for getting me out.

928
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,732
We're just sorry
we couldn't get you your bonus.

929
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,466
It wasn't mine to begin with.

930
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,835
But without it, I don't know
how I'm gonna pay you.

931
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:06,136
Don't worry about it.

932
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,805
Dean Morello's
footing this bill.

933
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:10,440
You believed in me.

934
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:15,178
I can't tell you how grateful
I am to both of you.

935
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,413
Never doubted you for a second.

936
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,552
Oh, Gabby, I wanted
to give you something.

937
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,789
Left it on your desk.

938
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,361
Thank you.

939
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:32,730
All right, well,
I'm gonna find some water.

940
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:36,134
You don't come back soon,

941
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:40,004
we're sending out
a search party.

942
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:42,340
You never doubted her
for a second?

943
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:43,307
I didn't doubt her
for a second.

944
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,742
I doubted her for days.

945
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,110
Yeah, that's not what
you just led her to believe.

946
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:47,878
People hear
what they want to hear.

947
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:49,246
Oh, I meant to ask you,

948
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,848
that big guy
that you got in a fight with,

949
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,316
Mr. T,
was he in on this whole thing?

950
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:56,619
No, he was just a dick.

951
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:04,462
That was
the most brilliant portrayal

952
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,564
of <i>King Lear</i> I have ever seen.

953
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,866
"Come up between the dragon
and his wrath."

954
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,334
That was...

955
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:12,471
Thank you for tonight,
Jessica, really.

956
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:13,639
This was nice.

957
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:15,807
This is really, really nice.

958
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,442
You're welcome, Louis.

959
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,711
And, yes, this was...
this was really nice.

960
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:24,116
Listen, I just want you to know
how much I appreciate

961
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:26,185
everything that you do
for this firm.

962
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,953
I take a lot of pride
in my work.

963
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,889
I know, and you're very good
at what you do.

964
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:33,559
Okay, can you just please say
that once in front

965
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:35,194
of Harvey?

966
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:36,762
Louis, I know you and Harvey

967
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,166
have a rivalry.

968
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:43,636
And the truth
is that, right now,

969
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:46,172
Harvey is more valuable
to the firm.

970
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,575
But that doesn't always mean

971
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:52,210
that he is going to be on top.

972
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:55,713
Because another truth is
is that I can't always count

973
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:58,149
on Harvey to listen to me,

974
00:38:58,217 --> 00:38:59,317
but I can count on you.

975
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:01,653
Yeah. Yes, you can.

976
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:04,290
So you keep doing
what you're doing, Louis,

977
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:05,725
and you're gonna be just fine.

978
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:07,260
And if he doesn't know it
already,

979
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,697
I promise
Harvey is going to understand

980
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,699
just how valuable
you are to me.

981
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,071
You know, next week
there's a revival of <i>Cats.</i>

982
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,573
No.

983
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,815
Nice touch.
Tickets to the Yankee game.

984
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:29,050
Found 'em on my desk.

985
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,385
Can't wait. You're welcome.

986
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,986
Nachos are on you this time.

987
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,855
Oh, those tickets
aren't for you and me.

988
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:36,758
They're for you and Louis.

989
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:38,059
Sunday the 20th.

990
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,360
Did I mention
that I'm busy that night?

991
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:40,628
I know you are.

992
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:42,430
You're busy going
to the Yankee game

993
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:43,431
with Louis.

994
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:45,966
Son, your ego's writing checks

995
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,069
that your body can't cash.

996
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,637
Oh, see, that's funny,
because now I'm quoting.

997
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:52,138
<i>Top gun</i> and...
get out of my office.

998
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:56,576
Very funny. Very funny.

999
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,277
Very funny.

1000
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,048
Mike.

1001
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:04,017
Hey, you got a second?

1002
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:06,219
I just...
I just want to thank you.

1003
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:07,421
Thank me for what?

1004
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,822
For going out of your way

1005
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,224
to help me with the LSATs.

1006
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,592
It's nothing.

1007
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,793
I'm sure you'd do
the same for me.

1008
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,728
I put a lot of pressure
on myself.

1009
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:16,196
I always have.

1010
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,264
You're right.

1011
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,599
I'm a perfectionist.

1012
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,301
It's okay.

1013
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,802
No, it's not okay.

1014
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,140
My dad, he always wanted a son.

1015
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,508
Never something
that they brought up.

1016
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:28,610
It was just sort of there.

1017
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:31,914
And I never felt
like I was good enough for him.

1018
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,683
Which is why I don't like
to put myself in positions

1019
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:35,785
where I might fail.

1020
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:39,222
So I decided
to just push the LSATs,

1021
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,857
give myself
a little more time to study.

1022
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:43,425
That's good. That's great.

1023
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:45,427
I think you made
the right choice.

1024
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:48,063
Really? Why?

1025
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,464
You were the one that's been
pushing me to take them

1026
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,531
next week.

1027
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,632
I just meant that I, you know,

1028
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,934
support the decision you made.

1029
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:56,570
Why are you suddenly changing
your tune?

1030
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:59,373
Because if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

1031
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:01,743
Listen, I got to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1032
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,044
No, that's not why.

1033
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,813
All that interest in Theresa

1034
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,749
and then the other guy
didn't show up, but you did.

1035
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,584
You were gonna take
the test for me.

1036
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:10,052
What guy?
What are you talking about?

1037
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,053
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1038
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,022
You're the test genius, right?

1039
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,924
- Um...
- Mike, I could pick up

1040
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,226
the phone
and find out right now.

1041
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:25,000
Yes, I took the test
for your friend Theresa.

1042
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,002
That's the whole reason
you were trying to help me.

1043
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,336
Because you thought
if you didn't,

1044
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,804
you were gonna get caught.
That's not true.

1045
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:31,606
How am I supposed
to believe that?

1046
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:33,407
Honestly, how am I supposed
to believe anything you say

1047
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:34,575
when the whole time
you were at Harvard

1048
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:35,943
studying to be a lawyer,

1049
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,878
you were actually cheating
for other people?

1050
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:39,246
Yes, I was helping people
cheat, okay, but...

1051
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,048
But what?

1052
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,927
It's not the whole story.
