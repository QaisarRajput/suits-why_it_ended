00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,898
Some morning meetings yourself.
[clicks tongue]

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,100
- Don't you worry
about my mornings.

162
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,736
What you need to worry about
is logan sanders.

163
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:28,673
He drive one of his father's
subsidiaries into bankruptcy?

164
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,276
- The opposite.
Boy got his sh... together.

165
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,778
Max is retiring,
and logan's taking over.

166
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,514
- Let me guess.
He wants a meeting.

167
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,917
With you, tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.M.

168
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,086
- Great.
Push it a week.

169
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,255
- Harvey, this kid considers
himself a young lion.

170
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,124
And the easiest way
for him to do that

171
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,959
Is to change lawyers.

172
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,694
- Maybe, but the last thing
a lion wants

173
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,230
Is to have his dinner handed
to him on a silver platter.

174
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,966
- You're gonna give him a hunt.

175
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,701
Did you think of that
all on your own?

176
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,802
- I'm extra sharp.

177
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,638
I haven't worked
a minute all morning.

178
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,673
See, that's funny, 'cause
I was late from all the sex.

179
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,208
- Get the hell out of my office.

180
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,911
- ♪ Bow chicka bow bow ♪

181
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,687
Look what the cat dragged in.

182
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,690
And you're wearing a vest.
- Here it comes.

183
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,126
- Here what comes?
Mazel tov.

184
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,094
Congratulations
on your special day.

185
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,863
- That's a good one.
- Harvey, leave him alone.

186
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,197
He looks better than you do.

187
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,333
- Thank you, donna.
- You're welcome.

188
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,834
Oh, and mr. Peanut called,

189
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,570
And he said he'd be happy
to lend you his top hat.

190
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,039
- Are you two finished?
- I could go all day.

191
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,340
- I think the vest
has had enough.

192
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,108
- Yeah.

193
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,944
- So you come all the way
down here just to let me know

194
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,012
That you were right
about waiter gillie?

195
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,681
- I came all the way over here
to tell you

196
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,982
I am done playing
in the kiddie pool.

197
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,850
- I'm listening.
- I'm going after a whale.

198
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,819
- I think I'm in love.
Let's go to war.

199
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,854
- That's the thing.

200
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,256
We're not going to war.

201
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,726
- Mike, the second
whoever it is finds out

202
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,227
That you've got 5%
of their company,

203
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,796
We're going to war
whether you like it or not.

204
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,365
- They're not gonna find
that out because I don't own 5%.

205
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,068
- Do I need to give you
a tutorial on the procedure?

206
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,736
You start by buying shares.

207
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,971
- I know what
the procedure is, harvey.

208
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,238
- Well, how many shares
have you bought?

209
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,907
- None.
- This phrase,

210
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,243
I don't think it means
what you think it means.

211
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,080
- Well, as inconceivable
as it might be to you, harvey,

212
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,815
I'm actually
not going in hostile.

213
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:17,983
- What are you talking about?

214
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,286
To buy their company
in order to keep it alive,

215
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,121
Instead of selling it for parts.

216
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,889
- You're offering someone
hugs and rainbows.

217
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,392
- I'm offering someone
the chance to survive

218
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,160
And banking
that they'll take that chance

219
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,262
Rather than give up.

220
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,831
- You don't have the money,
do you?

221
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,965
- No, I don't.

222
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,001
But even if I did,
I wouldn't use it.

223
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,403
- Well,
welcome to what every person

224
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,938
Who doesn't have money
has ever said.

225
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,007
- Oh, I get it.

226
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,275
You think this is the meeting
where you make fun of my idea.

227
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:50,849
That my idea is happening
whether you like it or not.

228
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,283
- Where's the fun
in that meeting?

229
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,818
- Oh, the fun?

230
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,788
It's all right over here
on this side of the table.

231
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,390
Hey, I'll give you a chance
to get acquainted

232
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,991
With the new reality.

233
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,192
I'll be in my office.

234
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,961
Get back to me
by the end of the day.

235
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,129
- Wow.

236
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:07,832
Looks like our baby boy's
all growns up.

237
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,135
- Hey, tell me, sweetheart,
you guys validate parking?

238
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,137
- Oh, yeah, sure thing.

239
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,738
I've got it right here.

240
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,173
- And how many hours
is that good for?

241
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,441
- What's it matter?

242
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,244
We're just gonna charge it
back to you anyway.

243
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,214
- You know my secretary is,
like, so much younger

244
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,685
Did he say "fitter"?

245
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,288
- What did you find out?

246
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,357
- Woodall's resurfacing.
- Me too. When?

247
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,958
- Next week.
- Me too. Where?

248
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,860
- S.E.C.
- Me too. Title?

249
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,829
- Supervisor.
- Director.

250
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,030
- Me too.
I just threw that in

251
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,865
To make sure
you weren't yes-man-ing me.

252
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,901
- I found out
the name of the man

253
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,035
Woodall's sending after us.

254
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,438
Jeff malone.

255
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,374
- Jeff malone is a beast.

256
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,878
To beat a beast
is with a bigger beast.

257
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,949
And let harvey and jessica know
that I had the foresight

258
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,384
To look for it,
the cunning to find it,

259
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,785
And the balls to stop it.

260
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,220
- Then you take on malone.

261
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,055
- Next stop: Name partner.

262
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,825
- Pearson specter litt.
- Okay, you know what?

263
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,428
Just let's not count
our chickens before they hatch.

264
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,830
But just for sh... s and giggles,
say it one more time.

265
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:16,334
- Donna, I got paul porter's
annual restructuring proposal.

266
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,337
Can you file it
under "I don't give a sh... "?

267
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,172
- What about mike?
You want me to have rachel

268
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,741
Prepare a dog and pony show
for him?

269
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,743
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

270
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,945
- Harvey, I need to talk
to you right now

271
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,046
About something very important.

272
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,414
- Harvey, why won't it
be necessary?

273
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,116
- 'Cause you don't beg
the girl to go out with you.

274
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,250
You wait.

275
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,119
She'll call.
- That's not even...

276
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,355
- Excuse me. Hold on a second.
Um, what if they don't call?

277
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,890
- They always call.

278
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,291
- Well, what about people
who aren't you?

279
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,427
- You mean you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

280
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,362
- If they don't call,
then they don't call.

281
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,164
But once they smell
your desperation,

282
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,465
They won't respect you,

283
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,334
And you'll never get
what you want anyway.

284
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,302
I'm sorry, did you want
to talk to me about something?

285
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,104
- It can wait.

286
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,906
- Come to think of it,

287
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,808
Tell rachel
when she's back from school

288
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,879
She can have
the rest of the day off.

289
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,116
- Harvey.

290
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,153
You do that, you might as well
send mike a telegram that says,

291
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,188
"I'm not putting any thought
into your idea."

292
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,023
- Yeah, might as well.

293
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,292
- Okay, are you sure that's how
you want to play this?

294
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:19,564
- You did, but this isn't about
whether or not mike calls back.

295
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,533
This is about you
not letting mike call the shots.

296
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,168
- I let him call the shots,
all he's gonna do

297
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,969
Is shoot himself in the foot.
- Maybe.

298
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,805
But if this was anybody
other than mike,

299
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,306
You wouldn't be acting
like this.

300
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,474
- Bullsh... I don't let
tony gianopolous push me around.

301
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,178
- No, of course you don't let
tony push you around,

302
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,914
But I've never seen you
mock one of his ideas.

303
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,215
- Yeah, because his ideas
aren't ridiculous.

304
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,517
- This is mike's first big idea.

305
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,120
- And I just told you,
his first big idea sucks.

306
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,556
- And if you use rachel
to deliver that message,

307
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:45,558
This is gonna end badly.

308
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,929
- Okay, act like a child
who doesn't want to be told

309
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,531
And you need to start
treating him like one.

310
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,567
- Donna, the next time
I need help figuring out

311
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,403
How to treat a client,
I'll let you know.

312
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,839
- Okay, great.

313
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,051
- Harvey, what can I do for you?

314
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,053
- There's a jeff malone
waiting in the conference room

315
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,187
Wanting to see both of us.

316
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,189
Any idea who he is?

317
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,092
- I've run into him before.
He's a hotshot at the s.E.C.

318
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,495
- What do you think he wants?
- Let's go find out.

319
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,867
- Ms. Pearson.

320
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,168
You must be harvey specter.

321
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,170
I'm jeff malone.
- I know who you are.

322
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,538
My question is,
why are you here?

323
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,407
- You seem hostile.
- You investigate

324
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,210
Publicly traded companies.
We're not publicly traded.

325
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,912
- No, but your clients are.

326
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,947
- Hence his question
and our hostility.

327
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,916
- Our?
- We tend to stick together

328
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,151
When an uninvited guest
interrupts our dinner.

329
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,454
- Well, I didn't bring any wine,
but when I go,

330
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,055
I hope you'll be happy
that I dropped by.

331
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,024
- Yeah, I doubt that.

332
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,393
- So why don't you tell us
which client you're here for

333
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,061
And be on your way?

334
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,497
- All of them.

335
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,067
- Since when does the s.E.C.
Go around intimidating law firms

336
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,602
By going after their clients?

337
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,104
- They don't, but they will

338
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,306
When eric woodall starts there
next week.

339
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,441
- He comes at our clients
after what he did,

340
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,045
This time, he won't get fired,
he'll end up in jail.

341
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,247
- Except it won't be woodall
who's coming.

342
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,482
It'll be him.

343
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,617
- Exactly.

344
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,420
Listen, I'm gonna be getting
a vaguely worded assignment

345
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,588
With a not-so-vague agenda

346
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,123
Of getting up
your clients' asses

347
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,191
With the full power
of the s.E.C.

348
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,326
And when they ask why...

349
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,328
And they always ask why...

350
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,696
I'm gonna be expected
to tell them

351
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,398
That it's because
they're clients of your firm.

352
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,302
- Because he doesn't want
to work for woodall.

353
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,071
He wants to work here.

354
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,441
- I've always heard
how good you were.

355
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,144
It's nice to see it's true.

356
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,313
Anyway, here's the thing.

357
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,316
I'm really tired
of being a public servant,

358
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,184
And more importantly,
I've always thought

359
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,453
That eric woodall was a, um...

360
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,255
Oh, sh...,
I'll just go ahead and say it.

361
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,558
- Finally, something
we can agree on.

362
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
- Seems to me the only thing
left for us to agree on, harvey,

363
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,728
Is my starting salary.

364
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,164
[chuckles] I'm just kidding.

365
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,333
I'm sure
all your new senior partners

366
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,168
Get paid the same.

367
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,336
- Before you start picking out
floor patterns

368
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,603
For your new office,

369
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,073
I'd like to discuss this
with my partner first.

370
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,709
- I'd expect nothing less.

371
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,311
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

372
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,246
I haven't been formally given
this assignment yet,

373
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,481
So I have no conflict.

374
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,716
But in one more week I will,

375
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,184
Which means this offer
will be gone.

376
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,318
- Is that a threat?

377
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,621
That I want to be
in business with, jessica.

378
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,691
It's just the truth.

379
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,596
- I like him.

380
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,568
- How did it go with harvey?

381
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,071
- Didn't.

382
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,173
- What do you mean "it didn't"?

383
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,110
You're the only man here
who can take on jeff malone.

384
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,645
How could he not see that?
- I didn't bring it up.

385
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,348
- Louis, winter is coming.

386
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,017
- I know,
and I'm the night's watch.

387
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,020
But right now
we need to be patient.

388
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,390
- Patience
is not your strong suit.

389
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,724
- Well, today it is.

390
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,326
Because if there's one thing
that I've always known,

391
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,528
It's that you do not call
the pretty girl.

392
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,263
You wait for her to call you.

393
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,465
- Louis, I'm seeing someone.

394
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,268
Though I have no idea why
you're saying that right now.

395
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,738
They're gonna find out
about jeff malone soon enough

396
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,209
And when he does, they're gonna
come right over to me.

397
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,345
- Like him all you want.
I'm not hiring him.

398
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,780
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

399
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,314
- Because you don't like
making decisions

400
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,083
Staring down the barrel
of a shotgun.

401
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,551
- Jessica pearson.
Nice to meet you.

402
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,453
- Jessica,
the man walked in here

403
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,088
And offered to fight for us.

404
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,523
If it's not him,
who's it gonna be?

405
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,392
- The guy in the office
next door.

406
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,796
- Harvey, louis knows
everything there is to know

407
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:45,798
About the s.E.C.

408
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,665
He's damn good, and you know it.

409
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,734
- This guy isn't damn good.
He's a killer.

410
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,203
- And he's a prosecutor.
We need a defender.

411
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,504
- If I'm in a dark alley,

412
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,239
I'd take the killer
over the defender

413
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:59,343
And eric woodall's gonna put us
in a dark alley.

414
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,745
- Louis is a known quantity.

415
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,814
And right now jeff malone's
biggest selling point

416
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,615
Is telling us
that woodall is coming.

417
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,850
- Louis sure as hell didn't,

418
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,685
Which means
he either didn't know

419
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,287
Or he wasn't man enough
to come in here

420
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,389
And take the job for himself.

421
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,525
- Harvey, do you know why
I don't like being strong-armed

422
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:19,197
Because I'll never be able
to trust the person who did it.

423
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,399
- Then figure out a way
to get someone as good

424
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,268
Or hire this guy
and come to terms with it.

425
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,536
Because if it's louis
against malone

426
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,606
In a street fight,
I'm picking that dude.

427
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,616
- Oh, thank you.

428
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,852
With the mysterious
harvey specter?

429
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,287
- Being a dick
doesn't make him mysterious.

430
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,289
- Well, then I guess
you're an open book.

431
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,425
- You know, I was gonna give you
those daft punk tickets,

432
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,861
But now after that,
I think I'll give them to edna.

433
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,296
- Okay, first of all, edna
was 63 when daft punk was born.

434
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,198
- Really?
With that skin?

435
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,233
- You know what, I worked hard
to get you those things.

436
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,568
- I dropped the hammer
on harvey,

437
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,637
Which means rachel's
gonna be working all night.

438
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,906
Hey, what are you doing here?

439
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,908
- Donna texted me
when I was at columbia...

440
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,711
- And told me
that harvey gave me

441
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,313
The rest of the day off
because I'm kicking ass.

442
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,282
- He's giving you
the rest of the day off?

443
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:16,621
We could celebrate over dinner
before the concert.

444
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,756
What, are you jealous 'cause
he never did that for you?

445
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,359
- [laughs] um, no.
That's great.

446
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,461
You pick a place.
I'll meet you there.

447
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,796
I got to set up some meetings
for tomorrow first.

448
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:26,898
- What about the little owl?

449
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,168
- Yeah.
- Okay.

450
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,679
- Mike, what are you doing here?

451
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,550
- You delivered a message,
so now I'm delivering one.

452
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,421
Pearson specter
is formally in review.

453
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,256
- What did you just say to me?

454
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,792
- You want my business,
you're gonna have to earn it.

455
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,195
- I have earned it.
- By sh... ing on my plan?

456
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,496
- You don't have a plan.

457
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,764
You're running into a wall.

458
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:00,865
It's not my job
to crash into it with you.

459
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,333
- Crash into it?

460
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,768
You didn't even ask me
who I'm going after.

461
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,836
- I didn't have to
because it doesn't matter.

462
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,605
But go ahead. Who is it?
- Gillie industries.

463
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,640
- That's not a whale.
That's a monster.

464
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:13,211
A man like waiter gillie isn't
gonna listen to a guy like you

465
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,413
Offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

466
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,715
- That's exactly
what you said to me

467
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,684
Before I got him to sell me
his distribution centers.

468
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,385
- Congratulations.
You got to walk his dog.

469
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,788
That doesn't mean he's gonna
let you marry his daughter.

470
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,457
- Listen to me.
You want to be my guy?

471
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,925
You stop telling me
why I can't do this,

472
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,294
And you start figuring out
how I can.

473
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,397
You get some money,
start buying some shares,

474
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,299
And you walk in there
with a club

475
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,502
- Harvey, when I told you
my plan's happening

476
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,004
Whether you like it or not,
I meant it.

477
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,706
I'm interviewing law firms
tomorrow.

478
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,808
You show up with a better
attitude and another move,

479
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,844
Or you just lost a client.

480
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,320
- Talk about what?

481
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:00,524
- About whatever's going on
with you and harvey.

482
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,695
- Why does everybody think
that I was born yesterday?

483
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,797
I tell you that he gives me
the rest of the day off work,

484
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
You vanish until dinner,
and then you're pissed off

485
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,034
For the rest of the night,

486
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,003
So it doesn't take
a rocket scientist.

487
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,838
- Clearly.

488
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,440
I meant "I love you."

489
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,309
- Mm-hmm, nice recovery.

490
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,910
Doesn't get you
out of answering my question.

491
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,911
- You really want to know?

492
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,780
I'll tell you.

493
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,549
Harvey was michael jordan.

494
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,387
Now it's lebron's time,
and he can't take it.

495
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,922
- That's a pretty big accusation
to make.

496
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,458
- Well, there's more
to the story than you know.

497
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,926
- What?
- Right, so come on.

498
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,396
I said I didn't want to get
between you two.

499
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,764
- What?

500
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,466
- [sighs]

501
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,835
Let's just say
that you kicking ass for him

502
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,039
Isn't the reason
you got the day off.

503
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,879
- I thought
you had law school today.

504
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,882
- I do right after this.

505
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,950
- He told you.

506
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,719
- Did you think he wouldn't?

507
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,554
Look, if you want to send
a message to mike,

508
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,057
If you want me to send
a message to mike,

509
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,759
Tell me when and where, but...

510
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:12,396
Please don't ever use me
like that again.

511
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,333
- You're right.

512
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,702
- I'm what now?

513
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,637
- I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

514
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,405
- Is it April fools' day?

515
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,907
- No, but don't ever
let it be said

516
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,041
That I can't admit
when I'm wrong.

517
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,710
- Then I will stop saying that.

518
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,411
- Didn't you say
you have class today?

519
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,814
- I'm on my way.

520
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,649
- What was that all about?

521
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,586
- Administrative stuff.
You and rachel.

522
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,522
- You mean about how everything
I said would happen happened,

523
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,624
And now you realize I was right
the whole time?

524
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,792
- No one likes a gloater, donna.

525
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,128
The harvey specter university
of gloating

526
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,563
Is gonna have to shut down.

527
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:49,567
- I can still give lectures
on the weekend.

528
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,901
You want to hear it?

529
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,937
You were right.

530
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,071
- [sighs]

531
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,439
- Call ray.

532
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,742
I'm gonna go let mike know
I'm his lawyer.

533
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:01,479
- You're gonna push
a meeting with me?

534
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,648
- Harvey, logan sanders
is here to see you.

535
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,817
- First of all,
I don't appreciate

536
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,686
You stomping into my office
with an attitude.

537
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,521
- Yeah, well, I don't appreciate
being put off,

538
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,822
Especially when I know
that you never pushed a meeting

539
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,090
With my father.

540
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,692
- Your father
never went to jessica

541
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,127
To set a meeting with me.

542
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,696
- Then I assume that next time
I call you directly,

543
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,997
You'll pick up the phone.

544
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,101
- Logan, let me give you
the abcs of me.

545
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,804
I don't take meetings.
I set them.

546
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,540
And my respect isn't demanded.
It's earned.

547
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,410
- That's only two things.
What's "c"?

548
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,812
- "C" is for people who show me
they know "a" and "b."

549
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,715
- Well, since we're quoting
<i>jerry maguire,</i>

550
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,683
All I want is for you
to show me the money.

551
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,953
- You just took step number one
towards earning my respect.

552
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,922
And I dig that about you.
- Great.

553
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,825
Would it be too much trouble for
me to discuss my business now?

554
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,494
- Well, I was gonna move on
to<i> crimson tide,</i>

555
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,796
But, yeah, go ahead.

556
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,497
Knock yourself out.

557
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,433
- You ever hear of a family
called the winwards?

558
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,835
- No. Should I?

559
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,103
- In 1950, they were worth
the equivalent

560
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,539
Of a billion dollars.

561
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,608
By 1988, one of them owned
a couple of dry cleaners.

562
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,943
And it didn't happen
because they squandered it.

563
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,179
It happened
because they stayed a dinosaur.

564
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,713
- You don't want to become
a dinosaur.

565
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,881
- No.
[sighs]

566
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,485
I like to think of myself
as a shark.

567
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,153
Keep moving forward or die.

568
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,888
- You're talking
hostile takeover.

569
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,090
- You think I'd be here
if I wasn't?

570
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,193
- You just took step number two
towards earning my respect.

571
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:26,697
- Gillie industries,
and I already own 4.9%.

572
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,099
- Logan, we have to end
this conversation right now.

573
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,201
- What are you talking about?

574
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,836
I thought I just earned
your respect.

575
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,505
- What do you mean,
you have a conflict?

576
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,773
- I mean we have a conflict.

577
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,775
- What are you gonna do
about it?

578
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,877
- I'm gonna go and resolve it.

579
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,080
- Well, you better do it fast,
because I am in on this.

580
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,249
And that means you're either
with me or against me.

581
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,953
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

582
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,065
- Hey. Prunie?

583
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,567
- What is that?
- It's a prune smoothie.

584
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,969
I invented it myself.

585
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,170
- Rain check.

586
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:10,708
Louis, guess who
stopped by yesterday

587
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,710
For an impromptu meeting
with jessica and harvey.

588
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,578
- Please tell me
it was dick cheney.

589
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,547
- Why would you want it
to be dick cheney?

590
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,816
- Why wouldn't I want it
to be iron dick?

591
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,251
Holy sh..., I think I know
who you were talking about.

592
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,152
- I think you do too.

593
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:26,190
Whose name happens to rhyme
with schmeff schmalone?

594
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,692
- Schmess it is,
and schmess it does.

595
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,094
- Well, schmuck me.

596
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,962
- Louis, we have a problem.

597
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,064
- What's the problem?
As if I didn't know.

598
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,668
[chuckles]

599
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,539
- I just got out of a meeting
with logan sanders.

600
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,641
- Logan sanders?

601
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,976
This isn't about...
- About what?

602
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,012
- The... n-never mind.

603
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,580
What's the problem?

604
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,581
- He wants to go
after the same company

605
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,250
- So what's the problem?
Mike brought it to you first.

606
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:57,721
- The problem is mike formally
put us in review.

607
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,591
- Holy sh...
That's why you're coming to me.

608
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,059
You're gonna lose mike,

609
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,727
And you want to know
if there's any way around it?

610
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,096
- Is there?
- No, harvey.

611
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,166
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to drop mike.

612
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,080
- What happened with harvey?
- Nothing.

613
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,749
He had an emergency with mike.

614
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,620
- Fine, but don't you think now
is the time to act for yourself?

615
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,589
- No, we have a good plan,
and we're sticking to it.

616
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,191
They're stewing on malone,
and the more they stew...

617
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,994
- The more leverage we have.

618
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:41,365
- And as I've said,
all we need to do is be patient.

619
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:45,636
- Well, patience may be
one of your virtues,

620
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,771
But it is not one of mine.

621
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,378
I didn't want to jinx it.

622
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,047
- You didn't.

623
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,724
Katrina, this is
one of the sweetest things

624
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:10,027
- I want to make sure
you don't waste your opportunity

625
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,997
To get this.

626
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,100
- I promise I won't.

627
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,771
[shudders]

628
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,011
- What are you doing here?

629
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,779
We shouldn't be seen together.

630
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,114
- You had no problem walking
into my place of business.

631
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,016
Why should I have a problem
walking into yours?

632
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,284
- Because unless you're here
to tell me that I have the job,

633
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,854
Then you're putting
my position here in jeopardy.

634
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,088
- How do you think I felt

635
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,423
When I found the man
that I'm sleeping with

636
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,192
Standing in my conference room?

637
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,761
- Jessica, will you please
lower your voice?

638
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:46,263
With a sh... eating grin
on your face

639
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,766
And tried to strong-arm me
into giving you a job.

640
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,802
- Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

641
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,405
[laughs]
- You're not funny.

642
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,674
Why didn't you come to me first
with this?

643
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,776
- Because if I had come to you
with this first,

644
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:01,211
You would have thought I was
trading on our relationship.

645
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,880
- Aren't you?
- No.

646
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,416
I would have gone
to both of you, all right?

647
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,017
So I went to both of you.

648
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,853
Now it may not
have been perfect, but...

649
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,455
There was no perfect way
of doing it,

650
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,291
- Now that sounds
pretty perfect to me.

651
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,727
- Do I have to draw you
a picture?

652
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,861
I'm not the one
that made up the saying

653
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,899
- Am I the sh... or the food in
this little painting of yours?

654
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,233
Because if we're just a fling,

655
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,301
Then what difference
does it make

656
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,070
Whether I work with you or not?

657
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,005
- I didn't say
we're just a fling.

658
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,873
- Then if there really
is a chance for us,

659
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:34,244
- Because I've seen what happens
when things go south

660
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,813
Between partners,

661
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,781
And I'm not willing to put
my business in jeopardy.

662
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:38,982
- Your business.

663
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:42,186
- Yes, my business.

664
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,155
The one that I have fought
tooth and nail to keep together,

665
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,292
The same business that
you strolled into with a shotgun

666
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:53,130
And said, "marry me,
or I'll start shooting."

667
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,232
- Jess, if you want me
to apologize

668
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,034
For the way that I asked,
then I will.

669
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,803
But I don't ask for things
that I don't want.

670
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,339
And what I want is to work
at pearson specter

671
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,142
And to keep seeing you.

672
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:09,279
- Those two things
are not both gonna happen.

673
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,181
- Then I guess
you have to decide

674
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,950
What's more important to you...

675
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:17,221
What we have or what you have.

676
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,028
- Hey, mike.

677
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,263
There's another prospect here
to see you,

678
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,998
But he's late,
and his tie's too fat.

679
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,768
- You tell her to say
all that garbage?

680
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,302
- He didn't need to,
johnnie fat tie.

681
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,271
- Yeah, I guess I have time
for one more meeting.

682
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,039
- Mike, I need to talk to you.
- Although, I'm sorry, sir.

683
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,208
You've missed the pastries.
I can call you some up.

684
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,810
- Listen to me.

685
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,345
I came down here
because I wanted to tell you

686
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,280
If you want to run
through this wall,

687
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,281
I'm ready to run through it
with you.

688
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,283
- Good.

689
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,018
- But I can't.

690
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
- What?

691
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,187
- What I can do is tell you

692
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,455
I'm ready
to run through another one.

693
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,023
- What the hell
are you talking about?

694
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,292
- We have a conflict.
- Bullsh...

695
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,494
Who is it?
- It's not bullsh...

696
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,562
- Then who is it?

697
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,030
- You know
I can't tell you that.

698
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:04,968
The day after you tell me
that my idea isn't good enough.

699
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,270
- I don't find it convenient
at all,

700
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:09,306
And now I have to go
with the other client.

701
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,308
- I put you in review because
you refused to get on board.

702
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,044
I want to run
through another wall with you,

703
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,980
And we still can
if you drop this.

704
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,183
- And why should I be the one
to drop it?

705
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:22,152
- Because they're not going to,
and I have to stick with them.

706
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,854
And I'm telling you,
you're gonna lose.

707
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,922
- What, because
you're on the other side?

708
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,156
- Because their plan is better.

709
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:30,160
Who has a brand-new vested
interest in me bowing out.

710
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,029
- I'm gonna let that go.

711
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,430
But if you don't let this go,

712
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:38,535
I can't represent you
on anything until it's over.

713
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:43,006
- Then I guess we're done here.

714
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,059
- You cook?

715
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,161
- You come home to this
in your kitchen,

716
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,330
And that's what you're going
to ask me?

717
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,464
- Well, I was gonna ask you

718
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:08,932
How the hell you got
into my apartment,

719
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,035
But I knew
you weren't gonna tell me.

720
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:16,406
I should think about taking
some morning meetings?

721
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,278
- I can't say that
it's never crossed my mind,

722
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,579
But you really think
it's a good idea...

723
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,881
- Jeff malone.

724
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,650
- Well, he's not my type.

725
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:27,918
You gotta be kidding me.

726
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,119
Why didn't you tell me
yesterday?

727
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,587
- Because I wasn't gonna
hire him yesterday,

728
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,456
So it was none of your business.

729
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,525
But today I might, so now it is.

730
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,895
- And you want to know
how I feel about it.

731
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:41,365
- Well, I already told you
how I feel about hiring him.

732
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,432
This doesn't change that.

733
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,535
- Good to know.

734
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:50,173
- Seems like something else
is on your mind.

735
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,609
- He doesn't
just want to work together.

736
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,045
He wants us
to keep seeing each other.

737
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:57,047
- And you don't want to risk
the one to have the other.

738
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:00,183
- No. I don't.

739
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,618
- I've been there.

740
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,320
- I know.

741
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:08,492
- Then you need to figure out
which is more important.

742
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:11,995
- I guess I do.

743
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,334
- So you two have, um...

744
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,970
- Yes.

745
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:22,940
- So he's seen you naked?

746
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:26,109
- That's usually
how these things work.

747
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,451
Are you picturing me naked
right now?

748
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,453
- Maybe.

749
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,255
Yes.

750
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,058
- Go wash your hands.

751
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,331
Don't spend too much time
in that bathroom.

752
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,199
- Let me get this straight.

753
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,968
You come to me
with a killer idea,

754
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,436
And all of a sudden
you don't want to do it anymore

755
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:56,573
- I don't want to do it because
it's not a killer idea anymore.

756
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,709
- Why the hell not?
- Because harvey has a conflict,

757
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:01,044
Which means somebody already
has a dog in the fight.

758
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,412
- Who gives a sh...?
- I do.

759
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,415
'Cause whoever it is
is already buying shares.

760
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,084
- You didn't come in here
to give up.

761
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,552
You came in here
to get my money.

762
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,521
- I give you my money,
now I have downside.

763
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,123
- Jonathan, look.

764
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,459
You said you wanted a home run.

765
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,626
You gotta pull out
your checkbook,

766
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,095
'cause I can't compete
without it.

767
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,997
- You could yesterday.
- Now it's today.

768
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,398
- And you're still
going in there

769
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,566
Another banker in a suit,

770
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,335
Hoping he'll trust you
based on nothing.

771
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,172
- I've got more than nothing.

772
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,508
- What the hell
are you talking about?

773
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,343
- Trust me.

774
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,746
I did my homework.

775
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,547
- Batter up.

776
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,023
- I said I'd tell you

777
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,090
What we were gonna do
with your centers

778
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,358
Five seconds after we closed.

779
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,061
- When did we close?

780
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,096
- About three seconds ago.

781
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,432
- I guess we better hurry.

782
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,170
All right, what's going
to happen to my employees?

783
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,738
- We're going to sell
your distribution centers

784
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,107
To a pharmaceutical company

785
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,575
As distribution centers.

786
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,743
They use your workers.

787
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,613
They hit the ground running.
Win-win.

788

But that's not why you're here.

790
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,656
- No, it isn't.

791
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:22,092
- I'm not interested
in selling my business.

792
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,261
- I know that,
because I know why

793
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,096
You've thrown your whole life
into this company

794
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,565
And why you chose the movie
business in the first place.

795
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,667
- What's your point?

796
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,603
- Phillip.

797
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,772
Your son.

798
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,475
You loved watching movies
together.

799
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,243
That's why you started
this company

800
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,212
And why you won't let go
of what it's become

801
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,313
For any amount of money.

802
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,582
- How do you know that?

803
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,717
- I told you.

804
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,754
I do my homework.

805
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,223
[exhales]

806
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,491
You lost him,

807
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,126
And you needed an outlet,

808
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,497
And that's what this company
is to you now...

809
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,499
Your family.

810
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,767
- I told you, I'm not selling.

811
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,635
- And I told you,
they're coming after you

812
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,771
Whether you like it or not.

813
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,706
And the difference
between me and them

814
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,308
Is they want to tear
your company apart,

815
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,510
And I want to keep it together.

816
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,112
- You don't have the resources
to do that.

817
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,180
- Yes.

818
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,417
I do.

819
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,486
As of an hour ago,
I started investing.

820
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:26,490
So by this time next week,
I will own 4.9%.

821
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,792
I didn't have to tell you that.

822
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:32,696
- And that's supposed
to make me trust you?

823
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,437
- I lost both of my parents
when I was 11 years old,

824
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:44,508
So I know a little something
about needing family.

825
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,744
Walter...

826
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,914
I can't guarantee you we'll win,

827
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,317
But I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

828
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,422
- All right, I'm in.

829
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,265
- Listen, zane,
I want that goddamn filing

830
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,866
On my desk nine seconds ago,
or you can forget

831
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,168
You ever worked here.

832
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,435
Now excuse me.

833
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,904
I've got to go be a dick
to someone.

834
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,206
- Sit down.

835
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,441
- [sighs]

836
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,310
Is this about you and mike?

837
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,646
- Listen to me...
this is gonna be a street fight,

838
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,515
And there's only gonna be
one man standing when it's over.

839
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,317
So I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

840
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,319
- You don't need to.

841
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
I don't want out.
I want in.

842
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,789
And when I said, "you want me
to send a message to mike?"

843
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,193
- I was just gonna ask
if you were comfortable

844
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,427
Getting me coffee
in the mornings.

845
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,496
- I'm serious.

846
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,631
I didn't back down
from a fight with my dad,

847
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,267
And I'm not going to back down
from one with mike.

848
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,670
- Good.

849
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,939
Now, I actually am
gonna get coffee.

850
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,840
- Great.
One sugar, a splash of cream,

851
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,476
And don't skimp on the hazelnut.

852
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,712
Too soon.

853
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,814
- Instead of failing
to be charming,

854

Why don't you do
something useful and get moving

On drawing up a tender offer
for logan sanders?

856
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,654
- Logan?
No, you mean max sanders.

857
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,556
- I keep forgetting that you're
in law school half the time.

858
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,958
Max is retired.

859
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,228
It's logan's show now.

- You wanted to see me?

862
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,803
- We need to move up
our timeline.

863
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,372
- Well, I'm buying shares
as fast as I can.

- I'm talking
about a tender offer.

865
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,275
- The plan is shock and awe.

866
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,010
If we rush a tender offer,
we won't have enough leverage

867
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,578
To force people to vote with us.

868
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,646
- It's fine
to have shock and awe

869
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:30,780
When you're the only one
in the game,

But waiter gillie
knows we're coming,

And he got himself an ally.

872
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,785
- How do you know that?

873
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,887
- Because I do.

874
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,656
- Your conflict...
who is it?

875
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,459
- I can't talk about it.
- Well, when the hell can you?

00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,028

get out of this if you want to.

Mike's not gonna sign that thing
if you tell him not to.

I wanted to see.

Donna, would you happen to have
the measurements

He waited,

I see you have the movies.
- Mm-hmm.

900
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,651

you've decided

Which relationship
you want us to have.

902
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:46,856
