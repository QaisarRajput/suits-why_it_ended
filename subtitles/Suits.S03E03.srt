you have them fooled, Cameron,

eventually.

This is bullshit, Cameron.
We had a deal.

A deal where your client

173

admitted to bribing
a foreign official.

that she paid off?

After that, six people
were killed by his troops.

I give my driver a tip,
and then he runs over someone.

177

Doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

But if the person
he hit was me,

And I did.

190

She admitted that was a bribe

191

would tie her to those deaths,

472
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,411
Yeah, it's like a name
and a title in one.

473
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,663
You'll see.

474
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,314
I've heard.

475
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:09,916
Secretarial pool's
been buzzing

476
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,834
about some new, feisty ginger
for a fortnight.

477
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,203
Look, if you're trying
to charm your way

478
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,671
into Harvey's office,
it's not gonna happen.

479
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,089
Mm, no, I'm not trying
to charm my way

480
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,257
into Harvey's office.

481
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,791
Oh, what were you
trying for?

482
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,593
Well, actually,
I was gonna try for--

483
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,761
Donna, I need you
to send Louis

484
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,463
everything we have
on Tony Gianopolous.

485
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,547
He's running point.

486
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,965
Harvey, a pleasure.
I'm Stephen.

487
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,268
I know who you are,
and I know why you're here.

488
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,688
You're Darby's fixer, and you're
here to hijack my case.

489
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:35,808
Did you text him
whilst we were--

490
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,528
You said you're good?

491
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,862
I'm good too.

492
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,482
This isn't over.

493
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,317
Is that a threat?

494
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:45,351
Mm, you take it
in whatever tone

495
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,354
pleases you the most.

496
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,327
You're right.

497
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:57,747
I am Darby's fixer, but I'm not
here to hijack anything.

498
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,165
When I got on a plane
at Heathrow,

499
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,467
this was still
merely bribery.

500
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,002
I've only just learned
of the murder charges now

501
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,304
as I touched down.

502
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,207
It just means the timing
changed, not the motive.

503
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,060
Forget the bombshell
the prosecution's just dropped.

504
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:15,315
Let's talk about the bombshell
outside your office.

505
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,433
Donna?

506
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,884
She's got a body
like Elizabeth Hurley

507
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,436
and the sass
of Maggie Thatcher.

508
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,689
I went out with Liz.

509
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,108
Don't sell her short
in the sass department.

510
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,527
Oh, I'm well aware
of her sass.

511
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:28,528
'99.

512
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:29,662
'98.

513
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,564
Really?

514
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,416
Well, you're obviously
a better man than I am.

515
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:36,235
Don't beat yourself up.
You got plenty of company.

516
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,571
By the way,
before you say anything else,

517
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,791
she can hear
every word we say.

518
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,177
Now, I've got
a murder charge to defend,

519
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,546
so why don't you tell me
why the hell you're really here?

520
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:49,632
Well, I'm here to oversee
cultural integration.

521
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,351
Cultural integration.

522
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,853
Standard part of the merger,
been on the books for two weeks.

523
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,937
And why do you need me?

524
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,522
Well, smoothing over

525
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,725
these transitional periods
is never easy.

526
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,943
It's not child's play.

527
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,780
You're an influencer here.
People listen to you.

528
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,948
I want you to help them
listen to me.

529
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,450
I get it.

530
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,569
You want me
to pave the way for you.

531
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,953
Here's the thing.

532
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,406
I don't pave the way
for people.

533
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,575
People pave the way for me.

534
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,828
Mm.

535
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,630
I get it.

536
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,466
Steer clear of you,
and you and I

537
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,919
will get along
just fine.

538
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,556
Welcome to New York.

539
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:38,864
So, have you met
Stephen Huntley yet.

540
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,698
- I did.
- What'd you think?

541
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,310
Turns out we have
some things in common.

542
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:46,571
Turns out he didn't
show up empty-handed.

543
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:47,839
That's $1/2 million.

544
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,424
Mmhmm, first dividend check
of the merger.

545
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,708
That was my buy-in amount.

546
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,261
Maybe it wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

547
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,930
Wait a second.
What was your check for?

548
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,215
More than that.

549
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,299
1.2?

550
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,801
I'm not telling.

551
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,687
1.5?

552
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,556
You're three times
more valuable than me?

553
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:07,108
Oh, I don't think that.
The check thinks that.

554
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,359
Does the check think
the only thing

555
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,445
that guy's here for
is cultural integration?

556
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,730
The check
wasn't born yesterday.

557
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,199
He is to Darby
what you are to me,

558
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,733
and I wouldn't send you
to do that.

559
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:16,784
No, you wouldn't.

560
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,152
So what'd you tell him?

561
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,622
I told him as long
as he steers clear of me,

562
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,623
he'll be fine.

563
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,991
You told him wrong.

564
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:27,328
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

565
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,132
She's right, you know.

566
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,134
Cultural integration's
scheduled for a week.

567
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,554
Stephen Huntley booked a room
at the Peninsula for a month.

568
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,423
Is it a room or a suite?
It's important.

569
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:40,592
- A suite.
- Good work.

570
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,927
- It's what I do.
- There's only one problem.

571
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:47,348
Jessica just told me
to look into him one second ago.

572
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,517
- I anticipated her needs.
- No, you didn't.

573
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,769
I anticipated your needs?

574
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,439
You anticipated your needs.
And by "your needs," I mean--

575
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,275
Okay, my needs are not
the topic of this conversation.

576
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,743
All I'm saying is,
you went to the trouble

577
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,829
of specifically finding out
he booked a suite.

578
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,832
- W--
- Save it.

579
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:16,127
Can I talk to you
for a second?

580
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:20,498
Not if it's about working
with Harvey on this case.

581
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,519
Look, this isn't easy for me
to do, but for some reason,

582
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,106
you and I keep locking horns,
and now I'm out in the cold.

583
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,725
I know how I got here, but
I don't know how to get back.

584
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,310
What do you want, Katrina?

585
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:35,280
I want to figure out a way
we can coexist in this firm.

586
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,514
You want to know a way?

587
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,683
When you see me coming,
give me a wide berth.

588
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,868
You know what?
I'm apologizing to you.

589
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,704
You don't have to be a dick.

590
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,205
I'm a dick?

591
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,023
You have treated
everyone at this firm

592
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:48,242
below your station
like shit.

593
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,411
Now all of a sudden
you want to be my best friend?

594
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,246
Oh, I get it.

595
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,698
This isn't about me and you.

596
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:56,551
This is about me
and your little girlfriend.

597
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,087
Rachel
is not my girlfriend.

598
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,974
This has nothing to do with her,
and this conversation is over.

599
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,979
Funny how you know exactly
who I was talking about.

600
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,225
Thank you.

601
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:24,162
Harvey, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this lunch?

602
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,114
I wanted to thank you
for the check.

603
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,533
Oh, I thought
that'd change your attitude.

604
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,584
It did.

605
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,419
In fact,
you gave something to me,

606
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,954
I want to give
something to you.

607
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,906
What is it?

608
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,008
It's a hotel bill.

609
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,261
I paid it.
Then I checked you out.

610
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,581
Hope you left housekeeping
a hefty gratuity.

611
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,799
You're not here
to deliver checks

612
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,768
or make
smooth transitions,

613
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,519
and if you're not
gonna tell me the truth,

614
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,021
you don't need
to be here at all.

615
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,222
Well, that's gonna make it

616
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:54,609
extremely difficult
for me to help you

617
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,612
take over the firm
from Jessica.

618
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,764
I know about your deal
with Edward.

619
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:00,898
He sent me here to help.

620
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,617
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

621
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,035
Well, you told me
Miss Moneypenny was listening.

622
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,953
I didn't know
whether you wanted her to hear.

623
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:10,408
So you're here to help me
take over the firm from Jessica?

624
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:13,378
What exactly does that mean?
You know what it means.

625
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,580
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

626
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:16,748
I'm not a baby-sitter.

627
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,717
I'm a fixer.

00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:42,660
What are you working on?

789
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:44,628
Oh, let me rephrase.

790
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,965
Why the hell aren't you
working on Ava's defense?

791
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:52,169
Uh, because we got fired.

792
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,971
That's no reason
not to work on her defense.

793
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,422
Look, Harvey,

794
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,141
I know we're just getting back
on the same team and all,

795
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,309
and I don't want
to disagree with you,

796
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,016
but it's actually
a very excellent reason.

797
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,312
Wrong.

798
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,547
Odds are Cameron's
expecting her to do this,

799
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:04,715
and we get a call tomorrow

800
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,016
to get her
out of a new bribery charge.

801
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,051
And then whatever lawyer
she replaces us with

802
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,770
can't stand up
to Cameron in court.

803
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,272
'Cause he's not gonna
stop working on this.

804
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:12,740
And neither are we.

805
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:14,241
One more thing.

806
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:16,026
Don't.
Don't what?

807
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:17,244
You think I don't know

808
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:18,996
what you were doing
in there with Rachel?

809
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,081
You saw it too?

810
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,334
I did,
and I need you to let it go.

811
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,703
Wait, so you're saying
she threw a punch,

812
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,338
and you don't want me
to throw a punch back?

813
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,707
I'm saying we're
in the middle of a murder trial,

814
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:32,909
and I need you
to let it go.

815
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:40,250
Harvey, is there something
you'd like to tell me about Ava?

816
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:42,553
Yeah, some clients can be
a pain in the ass.

817
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:44,221
Some ex-clients too.

818
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,056
- Temporary situation.
- Good, good.

819
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:48,025
'Cause I just wanted to make
sure you were still all over it.

820
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,643
Did you want to make sure
the sun was still shining

821
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,562
and the sky
was still blue?

822
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:54,598
I'd be humble
after I got fired.

823
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:57,067
If I ever got fired.

824
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,325
I don't know what it's like
in the D.A.'s office now,

825
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:05,492
but if I did
what you did

826
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,911
to someone who was with me
in the trenches,

827
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,963
I'd be done,
like you are now.

828
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:13,217
You have no idea what the
story is between me and Mike.

829
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,501
I don't care
what the story is.

830
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:17,287
You hired me,
and then you hung me out to dry.

831
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,390
You don't give me cases.
You don't give me a word.

832
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,591
What am I supposed to do?

833
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,459
We both know
how you got here.

834
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,596
You expect more from me?
That's not my problem.

835
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:26,930
I do know how I got here,

836
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:30,133
which is how I know
you're not gonna fire me.

837
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:32,152
So keep your empty threats
to yourself.

838
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:34,355
When I said, "you're done,"

839
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,807
I meant your future
at this firm is over,

840
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:38,325
because you will
never be anything

841
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,911
more than you are
right now.

842
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,782
And if you ever do
anything like that

843
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,583
to Mike Ross again,

844
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,535
I don't give a shit
what our deal was.

845
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,538
You'll be gone.

846
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,663
Hey.

847
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:01,799
Remember that thing
we were gonna do to Katrina?

848
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,183
We don't need
to do it anymore.

849
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,268
- What are you talking about?
- Harvey just did it.

850
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,887
He went to talk to her?

851
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:09,106
He laid her out.

852
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:13,694
Yeah, you don't want to be
on his bad side either.

853
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:14,862
You know, we could still
send her that thing.

854
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:15,979
Really?

855
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,648
No, actually,
Harvey told me not to.

856
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,866
So?
He's not so tough.

857
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah,
but we could take him.

858
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:20,951
What's he gonna do?

859
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,487
Talk to us with his words?

860
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:24,621
Wag a finger at us.

861
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:25,789
Maybe give us a time-out.

862
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:27,958
Maybe even slap us
with a lawsuit.

863
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,376
[Chuckles]

864
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,331
[Gasps]
High five.

865
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,633
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,143
We don't need to bribe
the witnesses.

867
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:41,672
We need them to sue us,
right?

868
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,924
The alien tort statute
allows foreign nationals

869
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,509
to bring civil claims
in U.S. court.

870
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,844
And then we settle.

871
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:48,479
Might be a payoff,
but it's a legal payoff.

872
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,213
And the witnesses
aren't Americans,

873
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:51,482
so Cameron
can't subpoena them.

874
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:52,716
Exactly.

875
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,050
Good, but they need
a legitimate claim,

876
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:56,153
or we could be on the hook
for bribery ourselves.

877
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,354
What are they suing us for?

878
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:58,966
Harvey, they witnessed
multiple murders.

879
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:00,741
That would be
emotionally distressing.

880
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:02,359
Might even
suffer from P.T.S.D.

881
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,944
Which would prevent them
from getting on the plane

882
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:05,412
and testifying
in our case.

883
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:06,864
Get it going.

884
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:08,699
You got a lawyer
to take the other side?

885
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,066
I have someone in mind,

886
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:11,869
but we need a way to get
those witnesses to go for it.

887
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,237
No, right now our problem
isn't getting them to go for it.

888
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,957
It's getting to Ava before she
gets someone to bribe them.

889
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,342
Hey, Harvey.

890
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:22,045
I heard about what you did
with Katrina.

891
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:25,182
I know I asked you not to,
and I wasn't going to,

892
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,301
but I saw her,
and I couldn't help it.

893
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:28,352
I get it.

894
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:29,753
She brings that out
in people,

895
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:33,724
but listen,
just don't let it happen again.

896
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:39,029
Son of a bitch.

897
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:08,186
I'd call you
a lying son of a bitch,

898
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:10,238
but you were
true to your word.

899
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,574
- Yeah, what word's that?
- You're not like me.

900
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,359
I didn't hijack
your client, Harvey.

901
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,277
Oh, no, you waited
for her to fire me,

902
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,363
and then you swooped in
with an illegal fix.

903
00:36:18,414 --> 00:36:19,581
You're wrong.

904
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:21,115
You gonna look me in the eye
and tell me

905
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,560
you didn't just meet with her
about bribing those witnesses?

906
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:25,370
That's exactly
what I met with her about.

907
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:27,422
She asked me if I was willing,
and I said I was.

908
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:31,209
I also told her that
in this particular situation,

909
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,878
it'd be counterproductive.

910
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,630
You looked
into Cameron Dennis.

911
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,383
She bribes those witnesses,
he'll be lying in wait.

912
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:39,801
And that's what
you told her?

913
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,219
Yeah, amongst other things.

914
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,304
You told her
to stick with the lawyer

915
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:44,606
she picked
in the first place?

916
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,859
More or less.

917
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:49,277
Harvey, listen,
I told you,

918
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:51,479
you don't have
to trust me, okay?

919
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:53,114
But Darby does.

920
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,482
And Darby wants this win.

921
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,150
Therefore, so do I.

922
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,570
I'm guessing you think
that means that I owe you.

923
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:01,873
No, I think it means
you're gonna pay me.

924
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,447
You look happy.

925
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:10,999
Dodged a bullet.

926
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,383
You got Ava back.

927
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:15,136
Stephen got Ava back.
Turns out he's here to help.

928
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:16,754
And you believe that?

929
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:19,007
He got Ava back.

930
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,726
Mike's on his way over there
as we speak.

931
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:22,727
Mike?

932
00:37:22,794 --> 00:37:23,845
He made the call.

933
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:25,396
Why not let him
score the touchdown?

934
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:28,016
And you must have
someplace else to be.

935
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,400
Blonde or brunette?

936
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:30,401
Neither.

937
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:33,238
I have to go repay a debt.

938
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:38,910
So once this is all
taken care of, I wire the money.

939
00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:43,448
And Cameron's witnesses
never take the stand.

940
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:46,367
Harvey told me
this maneuver was your idea.

941
00:37:46,452 --> 00:37:50,288
I'm not one to take credit,
but, yes, it was.

942
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,423
He trusts you,
doesn't he?

943
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:53,824
I like to think so.

944
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,843
So you know
how he thinks?

945
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:57,345
What I know
about how Harvey thinks

946
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:59,881
is that you can never be sure
what Harvey's gonna think.

947
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:01,766
What do you think
he thinks?

948
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:05,720
I think
that he's not really interested

949
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:07,355
in whether
you did it or not.

950
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,507
He's interested
in what the evidence is

951
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,175
and what we can
make it say.

952
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,443
I want to know.

953
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:16,030
- Then you should ask him.
- I'm asking you.

954
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,952
I have no idea
whether Harvey thinks

955
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,122
you had those people
murdered or not,

956
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:26,624
but even if I did,
I would never say anything

957
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:30,211
because he wouldn't
want me to.

958
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,663
He's picked
a good number two.

959
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:34,415
I like to think so.

960
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,467
What do you think?

961

to the best
of my ability.

963
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:46,260
To say anything else would be
as big a betrayal to Harvey

964
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:49,263
as discussing
what he thinks.

965
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:12,754
Let me guess,
you won the Testosterone 500,

966

and you're here to brag.

967
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:16,574
Actually,
Harvey took the checkered flag,

968
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,875
and I'm here for you.

969

Why would I go out

Well, losing
has its benefits.

971

If he thinks
he's a better man than me,

972
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:25,099
then he won't get jealous.

973
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,824
Oh, Harvey's got
nothing to be jealous of.

Not yet.
