00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,804
I'm offering you a deal...
One for you, one for me.

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,750
- You are not getting my office.
- Oh, yes, I am

4
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:06,968
'cause she's gone, Harvey.

5
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:08,507
It's time for you
to take the reins.

6
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:09,921
I'm here to ask you out.

7
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:11,756
As of this morning,
I'm the head of my firm,

8
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,672
and, when I thought
of sharing that with someone,

9
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:14,767
I thought of you.

10
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:15,843
One dinner.

11
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,226
I figured out what I want,
and I want to be

12
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,289
a partner at this firm.

13
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,015
All I'm asking is
for a seat at the table.

14
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,679
I'll have Louis about it.

15
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:24,475
You're afraid to take
responsibility for this firm,

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,968
and you won't admit it
to yourself!

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,421
You told me that you're
now head of the firm.

18
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,107
I am... i just haven't
told Louis yet.

19
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,522
I think this may have
been a mistake.

20
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:31,889
You don't think
I've had fantasies

21
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:33,045
that one day you'd take me

22
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,344
in your arms and kiss me?

23
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,405
Those fantasies weren't
of a man who's still too afraid

24
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,248
to take control of a firm
that bears his name.

25
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:39,953
I'm not giving up
my associates!

26
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:40,998
That's enough.

27

Donna asked for a seat
at the table,

28
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:43,609
and I gave her one.

29
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:45,265
You don't make her Goddamn
senior partner.

30

she'd tell you to do

Jessica isn't here,

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,580
to do with how she died.

312
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:01,978
And manner of death
isn't at issue here.

313
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,056
The contract is.
He's got a point.

314
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,923
Your honor, they're claiming
that my client entered

315
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,900
into a policy in bad faith.

316
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,467
Well, what kind of faith is it
when a company pores through

317
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:13,001
a woman's social media history
just to stick it

318
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,962
to her grieving husband
and three children?

319
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,040
Better faith than a man
that pretended to be an attorney

320
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,754
for the better part
of three years.

321
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,589
What are you talking about?

322
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,739
Your honor, this is Mr. Ross'
Harvard diploma.

323
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:27,873
The only problem is Mr. Ross
never actually went to Harvard.

324
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:31,725
The only place he did graduate
from was danbury federal prison

325
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,536
where he spent time
for impersonating a lawyer.

326
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,981
All right, that is
inadmissible and irrelevant.

327
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,775
You're claiming bad faith.
Your whole life is bad faith.

328
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,372
I think a jury should have
a chance to hear that.

329
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,200
- Your honor, this...
- Your motion to dismiss

330
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:47,961
is denied, Mr. Ackerman, but,
Mr. Ross, I am inclined to agree

331
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,111
that your history is relevant
to this case, which means,

332
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:54,690
if he wants to bring it up
at trial, I'm not stopping him.

333
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,489
So that's how you're gonna
play it?

334
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,942
- Excuse me?
- You're not gonna give me

335
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,499
your real settlement offer
right now?

336
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,302
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

337
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,555
Bullshit... I knew there was
a reason that woman

338
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,587
didn't give me an offer before.

339
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,547
Now I know it's because
you wanted me to see that.

340
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,356
Now that you mention it,
I did take the Liberty

341
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,544
of whipping up a little
standard boilerplate.

342
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,677
No admission of guilt,
you settle for pennies

343
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,215
on the dollar, and that's
take it or leave it.

344
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,442
Well, then let me
tell you right now...

345
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,978
We're leaving it.
You're required to present

346
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,869
this to your client.
Well, I'm also required

347
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,419
to give them my legal opinion,

348
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,517
which is that you stand to lose
a lot more than that.

349
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,048
Maybe you missed what
just went on back there.

350
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:30,416
What went on back there
is the judge ruled in my favor,

351
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,079
and you didn't get
your case dismissed.

352
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,604
He also showed his hand.

353

Now, how do you think
12 jurors are gonna rule

354
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:37,861
when it's plain as day
that the guy hearing the case

355
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:39,924

Harvey, I'm sure

And I told him last night that
I would back his decisions.
