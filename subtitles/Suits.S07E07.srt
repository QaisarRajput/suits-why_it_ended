1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:01,631
I'm talking about
the both of us,

2
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:04,035
convincing Hardman that two
kickass junior partners

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:06,966
are worth as much as one new
senior partner.

4
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:09,186
You had the chance to triple
our business,

5
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:10,988
and all you had to do was
take a knee.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,723
Tell me right now you weren't
the one

7
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,392
that Fletcher Engines
my game plan.

8
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:15,860
Hardman told me he wasn't
gonna make you partner anyway.

9
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:17,395
And once he offered it to me,

10
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:18,996
all I had to do was...
- Sell me out.

11
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:21,098
Mike's pro Bono
is against some prison.

12
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,133
And guess who builds
those prisons.

13
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:23,868
I gave him my word.

14
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,869
And you once gave your word
to me

15
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,003
and went back on it.

16
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,772
I had to lie to Harvey's face.

17
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:28,973
You either go and work
at the clinic

18
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,441
or you stay at Pearson Specter.

19
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,876
But you can't play them both
for fools

20
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,844
and put me in the middle.

21
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,446
I have a binding agreement
signed by his legal clinic,

22
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:37,014
stating that they would have
no outside help

23
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:38,115
from Pearson Specter Litt
on this case.

24
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:39,884
Yet they did.

25
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,686
You convinced me the only way
to heal

26
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:42,753
was to keep this from happening
to someone else,

27
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,989
and now I have nothing.

28
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,123
This isn't just about you
protecting

29
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,758
your client's interests.

30
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,427
It's about you protecting
yourself.

31

Why don't you tell me
what's really going on here?

32
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,902
That's it.

33
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,904
They've had me
by the balls ever since.

34
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,740
Jesus--how'd you let yourself
get compromised like that?

35
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,041
This is my situation, Harvey.

36

No.
This is a firm situation,

37
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:08,045
and we need to cut ties

38

I don't believe this.

No, Alex.

43
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,053
What's bullshit is
you letting yourself

44
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,855
be put in that position
for the last five years.

45
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:19,824
- Letting?
- Yeah, letting.

46
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:21,926
And now I gotta get us out,
because you did this to me.

47
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,861
Well, as long as we're
throwing blame around, Harvey,

48
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,796
I didn't do shit to you.

49
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,465
You did this to me.

All in.

What's going on with you?

65
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,304
I was supposed to
make partner today,

66
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:10,074
but Louis Litt screwed me over,
so there.

That's why I'm pissed.

I don't understand, Harvey.

I thought you were Jessica
Pearson's guy over there.

00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:21,051
I thought so too,
but she didn't have my back.

Well, what if I had your back?

bring someone in.

I can get you in as partner.

What's in it for you?

80
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,863
Bratton's about to
make an offer

81
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,198
to some big-time earner
at Skadden.

are a hell of a lot better

00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,162
What are you doing here?

1099
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,363
I'm here to come clean to you.

1100
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:00,165
Does Harvey know you're here?

1101
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,833
No--in fact, he told me
not to talk to you at all,

1102
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:04,302
but you have a right
to know the truth, and...

1103
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:08,306
I'm tired of having this whole
thing hanging over my head.

1104
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:10,441
Come on in.

1105
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:20,051
After Alex told Bratton that
I wasn't coming, he was nothing.

1106
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:23,588
They gave him unwinnable cases
and worked him 90 hours a week

1107
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,557
until one day,
Bratton came to him

1108
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,492
and said there was a way back.

1109
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:29,060
All he had to do was take on

1110
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,461
Masterson Construction
as a client.

1111
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:32,096
- Exactly.
- And he said yes.

1112
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:33,331
<i>Of course I said yes.</i>

1113
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,333
There were no red flags.

1114
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:39,137
The waiver that put inmates to
work was just smart business.

1115
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,505
On the surface,
everything was legit.

1116
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,540
So how'd you figure out
it wasn't?

1117
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,410
One day, I was at Brunswick,
and a guard gave me a letter.

1118
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:47,378
It said an inmate had died
on the job site,

1119
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,347
and that it was being
covered up.

1120
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:52,350
Let me guess: you took it to
Pat Kreuger, Masterson's CEO,

1121
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:54,619
and he said that
he'd look into it.

1122
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,855
Two weeks later, that guard
was murdered by an inmate.

1123
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,122
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1124
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,224
And that's when he knew

1125
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:00,558
Masterson and Reform Corp.

1126
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,593
had been colluding
from the start.

1127
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,228
So what did he do?

1128
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,230
He went to
his managing partner,

1129
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,398
and Tommy Bratton said it wasn't
collusion between two parties.

1130
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,300
It was collusion between
three parties.

1131
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,536
They tied all my bonuses
to all the key dates...

1132
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:13,438
- The waiver...
- The start of construction...

1133
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,139
- The guard's death...
- It looked like

1134
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,241
I orchestrated
the whole damn thing.

1135
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,408
So you covered up a murder?

1136
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,444
I had no proof of anything.

1137
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,212
I had a wife and daughter, and
it looked like I was in on it.

1138
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:24,315
Harvey, that's horrible,
but this isn't on you.

1139
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,284
Alex still could've made a call
anonymously.

1140
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:29,420
And so could you when
you found out Mike was a fraud.

1141
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:31,522
You didn't have to be a party
to a crime, but you were.

1142
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:33,291
That crime wasn't a murder.

1143
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,159
Did you hear me, Donna?
They had him.

1144
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,561
I had a wife and daughter,
and they set me up.

1145
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:39,497
What was I supposed to do?

1146
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:42,133
Mike, I hate these people.

1147
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:43,668
They deserve to go away
for what they did,

1148
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,237
and every morning when I woke up
and every night

1149
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,406
when I went to sleep,
I wanted to make that happen,

1150
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:52,277
but I didn't, for one reason:

1151
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,412
I didn't want my daughter
to grow up without a father,

1152
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:56,147
and if you pursue this,

1153
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,448
there's no way I don't get
caught up in it.

1154
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,150
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

1155
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:00,685
When Bratton came after
our clients,

1156
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:04,155
Alex signed a declaration saying
he took full responsibility.

1157
00:42:04,157 --> 00:42:05,924
Harvey, if you're asking Mike
to let this thing go...

1158
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,458
I don't know if I can do that.

1159
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,260
I'm not asking you
to let it go.

1160
00:42:09,262 --> 00:42:11,663
I'm telling you what will happen
if you don't.

1161
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:19,003
