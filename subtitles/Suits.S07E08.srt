I'm here to tell you you're
backing the hell off my firm.

3
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,282
You got to sign something

when he's asking you to leave
a job that you love,

17

some of that money

When the whole thing was over?

impugning his integrity

535
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:33,748

Lewis, tell me
what's going on.

00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:01,298
You went all the way over there
to get them on board

00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,522

I'm not doing it.
Then what exactly

562
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,766
is your plan, because the
hearing's in five minutes

563
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,086

00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,687
because it's your
two month anniversary.

778
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:20,773
- How can you know that?
- Because I care about him.

779
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,398
And you coming into his life...

780
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,393
Is a memorable event.

781
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:31,015
Well, it was good
to see you, Donna.

782
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:36,703
Carbone.

783
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,929
I'm sorry.

784
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:41,054
It's a hole in the wall,

785
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:42,688
but it's one
of Harvey's favorite places.

786
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:44,585
So if you're looking
for a reservation...

787
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,000
actually, I already have one.

788
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,898
Oh, let me guess.

789
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,304
- At Carbone.
- Yes.

790
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,663
Well, I'm sure
you'll have a great time.

791
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:56,305
Thank you for
the recommendation, Donna.

792
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,726
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

793
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:06,460
- What is it, Rachel?
- Okay, I was thinking,

794
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:09,042
we never got to have
those drinks we talked about

795
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:10,410
and, Donna, I know you've been
going through

796
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,656
a lot of stuff, lately.

797
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,070
So I thought maybe
you could use a night

798
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:15,867
where you just
lose your troubles

799
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:18,265
and just feel good
about yourself.

800
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,359
- I could.
- So, what do you say?

801
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,929
Is Harriet Specter available

802
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:25,843
to go out with
Michelle Ross tonight?

803
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,757
I can't tonight,
Rachel; I have plans.

804
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:32,968
That's mysterious.
What do you have, a hot date?

805
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah.
Something like that.

806
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:40,859
- Is he in?
- Yes, but you can't

807
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,219
- go in there.
- Try and stop me.

808
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,218
- Wait a second.
- You son of a bitch.

809
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,640
You murdered Frank Gallo.

810
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,784
Ashley, I'll handle this.

811
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:54,640
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

812
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,453
- Bullshit!
- You said if I couldn't

813
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:57,898
stop him from testifying,

814
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:59,124
you'd find someone who could.

815
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,507
I meant I'd get
Thomas Bratton involved.

816
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:02,976
I didn't mean I'd kill a man.

817
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:05,140
And you did stop Gallo
from testifying,

818
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:06,328
so why would it matter?

819
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,216
Because he wanted to make sure
that Robert Zane

820
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,938
didn't reverse it,
so you had him murdered.

821
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:13,273
And how exactly did I arrange
this supposed murder?

822
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,953
The same damn way you killed
that guard and covered it up.

823
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,874
Once again, Harvey, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

824
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,093
And you can accuse me
of anything you want,

825
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:22,929
but that man was
a hardened criminal

826
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:25,687
who could've been killed
by anyone for anything.

827
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,080
And I am not gonna lose
a second of sleep over it.

828
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:30,812
I beg to differ.

829
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,132
- Robert.
- What the hell

830
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,312
is going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on.

831
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,273
I got something
for you to see.

832
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:42,538
And it's not on Netflix.

833
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:46,574
Frank Gallo,
prisoner 09842.

834
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,445
Danbury Federal Prison.

835
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,445
All right.
Enough bullshit.

836
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,796
I'm your lawyer.
None of this is admissible.

837
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,726
Now tell me the truth,

838
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:57,343
so I know what I'm dealing with.

839
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:00,163
All right, you want the truth,
let's just get to it.

840
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:04,413
There was a guard, sent a letter
to some lawyer on the outside

841
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,710
who was getting suspicious of
what was going on in there.

842
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:09,294
They wanted me to remind him

843
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:10,663
of where he was
in the food chain.

844
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:14,503
- And you were happy to do it.
- No, I wasn't.

845
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,832
We were hard men in there.

846
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:19,116
Tough guys, murderers.

847
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:22,085
That guard was just
a sweet, old man.

848
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,413
Never hurt a soul
in all his years.

849
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:26,897
And you expect me
to believe all that.

850
00:33:27,077 --> 00:33:29,061
You can believe it or not,
it's the truth.

851
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:30,885
So I told them I wouldn't do it

852
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,319
until whoever was
running the show

853
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:34,522
came to me directly.

854
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,669
And they made that happen.

855
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,811
They had no choice.

856
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:37,999
Next day, the guy showed up

857
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:39,213
right in my God damn cell

858
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,835
like he owned the place,

859
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:43,083
- which he did.
- And who exactly was that?

860
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:47,702
Roger Shapiro.
CEO of Reform Corp.

861
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,405
<i>And then what happened?</i>

862
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:51,335
<i>I, uh...</i>

863
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:54,022
<i>I got him alone that night
in the mess hall.</i>

864
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,476
Wouldn't you know, the old man
still had some fight in him.

865
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:59,390
Next thing I knew,
it was him or me, so...

866
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,471
I had to put him down.

867
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:03,429
You killed him.

868
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,632
Yeah.

869
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:08,923
I killed him.

870
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:11,054
And then what did you do?

871
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:14,585
I told them I was done, out,
no more.

872
00:34:14,798 --> 00:34:17,858
<i>Next night, Roger Shapiro
sent five of my friends</i>

873
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:19,835
<i>to do the same thing to me.</i>

874
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:23,140
Looks like you're in
some deep shit, Roger.

875
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,788
- I don't believe it.
- So you two

876
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:27,225
were in on this together.
To quote you,

877
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,022
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

878
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,132
I certainly didn't go to
Robert's house this morning

879
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,999
and tell him that I think that
you had Frank Gallo murdered

880
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,413
so he wouldn't be able
to testify.

881
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,340
And I certainly didn't say
if you had,

882
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,827
you made a huge mistake
because now this tape

883
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:42,366
is a death bed confession

884
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,233
and by law is admissible.

885
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,046
And all that bullshit
I came up with,

886
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:48,461
about Robert being intimidated
by Frank Gallo,

887
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,484
well, that doesn't apply anymore

888
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:52,679
because Frank Gallo's dead.

889
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,499
- So what do you want?
- What I want

890
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,593
is for you to go away
for murder.

891
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:01,085
But that's not gonna happen

892
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:04,004
so I'll settle for the number
I wanted in the first place.

893
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,600
But you're never gonna pull
this shit again on prisoners

894
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,944
because if you do, I don't care
about Alex Williams.

895
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,159
This tape goes
to the department of justice

896
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:15,541
and you are headed
to one of your own prisons,

897
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:17,289
five seconds later.

898
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,809
I think that's something
that I could work with.

899
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:33,309
Now, if there's nothing else,
I'd like you both to leave.

900
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:35,317
Oh, we're not done
with you yet.

901
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:36,981
- What now?
- I'll tell you what now,

902
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,532
you're gonna write up
something for me

903
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,278
and you're not gonna like it.

904
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:41,863
But if you wanna
stay out of prison,

905
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,317
you're gonna make damn sure

906
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,505
it says exactly
what I need it to.

907
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,934
What the hell is this?

908
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:56,348
Tommy.

909
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,991
You mind telling me
how the hell you got in here?

910
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,833
People like me here, Tommy.

911
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,512
That's how I got in.

912
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:05,856
But the question you should be
asking is why I'm here.

913
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,520
I don't give a shit
why you're here.

914
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,106
I want my God damn
affidavit back.

915
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:11,294
Sure thing. You also want me
to sign over

916
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,500
the deed to my house in
the Hamptons, while I'm at it?

917
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:15,294
You can keep
your shitty house.

918
00:36:15,553 --> 00:36:16,957
Because you're gonna need
someplace to go

919
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:19,070
after you resign.
What did you just say to me?

920
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:21,165
He said he's here
for his affidavit

921
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:24,048
and your resignation,
you smug piece of shit.

922
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:26,386
What you guys,
plan on beating it out of me?

923
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,083
Because that's the only way
you'd get it.

924
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,434
We don't need to
beat up an old man, Tommy.

925
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,669
We just need to show you this.

926
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:36,215
- What's that?
- That's a signed confession

927
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,942
from Robert Shapiro,
say he entered into a conspiracy

928
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,075
with Masterson Construction
to defraud

929
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:42,583
the United States Government.

930
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:46,066
And that that conspiracy
was arranged by you.

931
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:49,044
No way.
Roger would never do that.

932
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,271
Oh, he did it.
For the same reason

933
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,270
you're gonna give us
what we want.

934
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:54,676
We had him by the balls.

935
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:57,075
Just like I got you
right now, Tommy.

936
00:36:57,373 --> 00:36:59,380
So you can pick up the phone
and call him,

937
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:01,723
or you can look at my face
and see I'm not lying.

938
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:04,166
But either way,
we're not leaving here

939
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,122
without getting what we want.

940
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,348
I'm not going
to stand here

941
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,653
and write my resignation letter
in front of you two, okay?

942
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:18,144
Then it's a good thing
we wrote one up for you.

945
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,287
By the way, remember when
I told you you owed me?

946
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:31,133
I'd pretty much
say we're even.

947
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:33,562
I don't think this word even
means what you think it means.

948
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,875
Oh, well, is that a fact?

949
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,756
You're damn right it is.
I turned down a job offer.

950
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:39,047
You were gonna go to prison.

951

You owe me for the rest

Got it. Me and you, square.

953
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,410
Once again, I don't think
the word square

954
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,199
means what you think it means.
You're right.

955

We still gotta go eat on you.

956

Sorry, can't tonight, Alex.
I got other plans.

957
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:56,079
What are you doing here?

958
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,258
I came to apologize
for what I did.

959
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,330
I thought you said
it was Rachel's idea.

960
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:02,140
It was, but you said

961
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:03,195
I should've stopped it

962
00:38:03,243 --> 00:38:06,328
in its tracks
and you were right.

963
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,640
Robert, I'm sorry.

964
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,979
I love Rachel. I would never
do anything to hurt her.

965
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:13,632
But I should've known to never
do anything to hurt you.

966
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:16,782
It takes a big man
to say that, Mike.

967
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:19,281
I appreciate it.

968
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,671
And I'd be lying if I didn't
admit it worked out

969
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,249
for everybody in the end.

970
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:25,421
Yeah, not everybody.

971
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:28,788
I'm not losing any sleep
over that son of a bitch.

972
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,399
He may not have threatened
Rachel to me,

973
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:32,093
but he sure as hell
threatened her to you.

974
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:35,319
I know.
And I know he was a murderer.

975
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,085
But... Harvey showed me that
tape.

976
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,726
You can see how much he cared
about his daughter.

977
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:42,869
Fact of the matter is,

978
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:46,156
they're never gonna see
each other again.

979
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:50,554
Then to Frank Gallo.

980
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:53,296
May he rest in peace.

981
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,476
<i>I told them I was done.
No more, out.</i>

982
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,120
Next night, Roger Shapiro
sent five of my friends

983
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:02,851
<i>to do the same thing to me.</i>

984
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,512
You're willing to testify
to that in court.

985
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,304
No way, I tell them that,
they'll put me away for murder.

986
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:13,156
- You're already away.
- Yeah, for seven more years.

987
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,433
I tell them this,
they'll put me away for life.

988
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:16,999
What if I can
get you immunity?

989
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,109
- You can't promise me that.
- No, I can't.

990
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,765
But if you did this for me,
there's no way

991
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,468
I'm gonna let them
convict you for murder.

992
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:26,579
Why should I believe you?

993
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:28,921
For the same reason you need
to take that stand.

994
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,634
I know what it's like
to have a daughter.

995
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,984
<i>And I know you cut that deal
with Mike Ross</i>

996
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,541
<i>so that she'd forgive you.</i>

997
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,265
<i>But she needs more than that
to forgive you.</i>

998
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:40,335
She needs to know her father
is a good man.

999
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,529
- I'm not a good man.
- Yeah, maybe not.

1000
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,812
But if you got up there
and told the world what you did,

1001
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,460
<i>and stopped these monsters from
ever doing it again...</i>

1002
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:52,292
<i>You let her see that...
She'll forgive you.</i>

1003
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,515
<i>And I swear
on my own daughter,</i>

1004
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:57,312
<i>I will not let you
go down for it.</i>

1005
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,007
Okay.

1006
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,124

And I certainly
don't expect you to
