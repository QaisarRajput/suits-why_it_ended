She asked if she could say
a few words about Dad.

And what,
you're gonna let her?

159
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:48,876

- She is not saying

160
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,833
a single word
as long as I'm here.

Yes, she is,

our dad into the ground,

I swear to God, I will beat
the shit out of you,

165
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:03,112
because she's my mother, and
I'm gonna let her say her piece.

It's good to see you.

Wish I could say
the same thing, Lily, but...

00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,823
I'd be lying if I did.

170
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,488
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

171
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,825
And whether you believe it

And I am sad to see him go.

Yeah, well,
I don't believe it,

there was a chance in hell
I was getting this job.

- I see you met Oliver here.

I guess the only thing left

00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,814
is for you to show me
where my desk is.

216
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:18,507
Right. It's, uh, right inside
that office right there.

00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:21,944
I didn't think
I was getting an office.

Look, just because
I'm paying you dick

219
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,426
doesn't mean I'm not gonna
give you the tools for the job.

What exactly is my job?
'Cause as far as I can tell,

00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,251
I'm the only one here

Everybody listen up.

00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,987
You have a new supervisor
starting today.

His name is Mike Ross.

225
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,058
Mike is from
Pearson Specter Litt,

226
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,527
and he knows more about law
than all of you combined.

227
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:42,363
So, if Mike tells you to do
something, you do it.

I don't mean to question
the new world order,

but what is his title?

230
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,137
Great question, Marissa.
Um...

in charge of you?

232
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,275
Any more queries?
I didn't think so.

233
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,544
All right, back to work.
Let's go.

doing this for you.

I'm gonna take
full advantage of it.

241
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,462
Then why don't you go back
to wherever your office is

242
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,930
and stay there for the rest

Miss Price missed
her court date,

which means I need to know
what your plan is.

My plan is
to have Miss Price

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,176
explain that she is
a single mother

00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,856
living in an apartment
with a broken window

and no heat for months, and
they're trying to kick her out.

299
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,250
And if all you're gonna do
is tell the judge

300
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,518
that it's not fair,
you're gonna lose.

301
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,588
You need legal foundation.

Then I hope you have backup,

have kicked out

300 tenants
in the past six years,

308

they are not messing around.

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,783
I will. Thank you.

[both chuckle]

940
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:33,344
- You're back.
- I am.

941
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,048
And I heard you took care
of my client.

942
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,950
Thanks, Louis.

943
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:42,053
You're welcome,
but we're partners,

944
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,988
and they're all our clients.

945
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:46,157
They are.

946
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:48,560
Louis, I didn't mean it
when I said

947
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,763
you weren't ready to be
managing partner.

948
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:53,465
Yes, you did.

949
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,967
Maybe I did,
but the truth is,

950
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:59,037
I'm not ready either.

951
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:03,241
What do you say we both act
as interim managing partners?

952
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,044
I'd be honored.

953
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,360
It seems to me,
the first order of business is,

954
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:12,651
what are we gonna do about
the name of the firm?

955
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:17,656
I don't know
about you, but...

956
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,025
I think we should keep it
exactly the same.

957
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,326
Me too.

958
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:22,627
I mean, you never know

959
00:40:22,663 --> 00:40:25,464
when she's gonna want
to come back, right?

960
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:29,368
No, Louis.
You never know.

What are you two
still doing here?

964
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:41,979
We've still got 12 hours.

965
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:44,548
We're not going to stop trying
to keep Sofia in her apartment.

Good for you.

But you don't
have to do it tonight.

968

Turns out she got
a little grace period.

How did she get that?

970

It's amazing
what you can do

971
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,730
when you care
about your clients.

972
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,268
Then I guess
first thing tomorrow,

973
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:07,605
we should plan our next move.

974
