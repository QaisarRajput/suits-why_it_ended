1
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:04,651
I just don't understand.

2
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:05,876
Yeah, there's a lot of
things you don't understand.

3
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,608
Everyone is wearing a black tie.

4
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,120
And, you're wearing a gray tie.

5
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,297
This is acceptable
at a black tie affair.

6
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:13,830
There's nothing wrong with
the tie that I'm wearing.

7
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:14,928
- Thank you...
- Yes, please.

8
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:16,926
Champagne, sir?

9
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,992
Is it?

10
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,158
From the region?

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,556
In France?

12
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:23,655
Because if it's not,
it's called sparkling wine,

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,057
and I don't really drink
sparkling wine.

14
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,832
- Forget it.
- Forgive him.

15
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,766
His parents really wanted
a girl.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,967
Never got over it.

17
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:30,969
Wait a minute.
You can taste the difference.

18
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,174
I'm not being a snob.

19
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,241
Not a snob?

20
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:34,440
You sound like Frasier's
brother.

21
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,375
Niles Crane
was completely misunderstood.

22
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:37,407
Okay, boys, you don't want me

23
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,407
to give you a time-out now,
do you?

24
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,842
Look, I'd be willing to stand

25
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:41,509
in a corner if you agree
to paddle his bottom.

26
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:42,943
That's hilarious.

27
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,648
I'm just saying that if they
want us to donate

28
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,549
to their charity,
they might as well step it up.

29
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,720
You know, make me want
to give away my money.

30
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:49,787
Your money?

31
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:51,021
You're here representing
the firm, Louis.

32
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:52,422
And we've always been committed

33
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,188
to giving back
to the community.

34
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:58,591
Jessica, is that...

35
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,328
Tori.
Yes, and I owe her a call.

36
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,396
Excuse me.

37
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,737
Do I smell like sausage?

38
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,241
No more than usual. Why?

39
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,843
Uh, because I'm about to meet
the future Mrs. Louis Litt.

40
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,878
I had pizza before I came
and I just want to make sure

41
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:17,214
I still am not emanating
any aroma.

42
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:18,982
Oh, you're emanating something.

43
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,857
It's called pheromones
and women find it irresistible.

44
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,361
Watch this.

45
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,197
Harvey.

46
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:35,032
You remember Tori?

47
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,500
Of course. Nice to see you.

48
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,402
I told Jessica I don't really
want to talk shop

49
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,004
while we're here
to support a good cause.

50
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,174
Well, that's the beautiful
thing about a retainer.

51
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,174
We're always on call
when you need us.

52
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,045
So how can we help?

53
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,081
It involves one of our most
trusted senior VPs.

54
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:52,150
Something recently came
to light about his past

55
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,919
and I'm shocked by it, really.

56
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:56,889
You tell us where it hurts
and we'll make it go away.

57
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,932
Oh!

58
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,833
Uh... Ooh.

59
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,601
Wait. Wait.

60
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:12,902
- Wait?
- Yeah.

61
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:15,071
Well, it's just...

62
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,405
This feels like it's moving
really fast.

63
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,173
I should slow down?

64
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,774
No, I just... I mean, like...

65
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,110
I just got out of
a relationship and...

66
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:23,679
Right.

67
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,946
You kind of did too.

68
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:26,715
I wasn't really seeing anyone.

69
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,451
You know what I mean.

70
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:30,920
Trevor.

71
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,755
Yeah, Trevor.

72
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,557
Right. Trevor.

73
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,927
Um, ahem.

74
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,028
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

75
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:39,329
We should slow down.

76
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:42,400
I should make us some tea.

77
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:43,401
- You want some tea?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

78
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:44,402
Yeah, let's drink some tea.

79
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:47,538
Thank you.

80
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:54,879
What's the, uh, Harvard Club?

81
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,483
Oh, it's, uh...
it's, like, this clubhouse

82
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,385
for Harvard alumni.

83
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,820
Yeah, that invite is, uh...

84
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,522
it's for this networking
thing for lawyers.

85
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,756
I got it at work.

86
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,391
Hmm, would you go?

87
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:08,294
What? Are you kidding me?

88
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:09,528
No.

89
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,197
I have a hard enough time
pretending at work.

90
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,966
It's not like I want
to enter the lion's den.

91
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:21,674
Well, if you were gonna go...

92
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,843
and you were gonna
take a date...

93
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:26,712
It would be you.

94
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:31,683
I'd love to take you.

95
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:34,419
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

96
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:35,887
Who's moving too fast now?

97
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,189
Oh, well, that's due to saying
all the right things.

98
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,360
Oh.

99
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:50,835
Hey, what's the emergency?

100
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,437
Couldn't find a date
to the prom?

101
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,005
We're firing Stan Jacobson.

102
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,207
Who?

103
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,943
Senior Vice President,
Drybeck Accounting.

104
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,645
- Our accounting firm?
- Yes.

105
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,380
They're our firm
and our client.

106
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:02,848
How's that possible?

107
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,217
They signed a conflict
of interest waiver.

108
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,451
Look at that.

109
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,953
He's actually learning
how the law works.

110
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,455
Acquaint yourself with
Drybeck's company charter

111
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,523
and Stan's original
employment contract.

112
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:13,958
- What'd he do?
- He lied.

113
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,393
He lied? About what?

114
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:18,629
Wait, let me guess.
He cooked the books.

115
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:19,697
God, doesn't anyone
on Wall Street

116
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:21,632
put in an honest day's work
anymore?

117
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,836
Actually, he's got
a stellar record as a Senior VP.

118
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,537
He lied on his resume.

119
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,640
Never got his CPA license.

120
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:31,008
Never even went
to business school.

121
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,643
He lied about
where he went to school

122
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,379
and now he's getting fired?

123
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,982
Drybeck does the books
for half of Wall Street.

124
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:40,119
Word gets out that
a senior staff is a fraud,

125
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,687
they're gonna start
bleeding clients.

126
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:46,192
We have to do this fast
and keep it quiet.

127
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,827
Relax.

128
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,228
That's not gonna happen to you.

129
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:52,232
But I would get fired
if Jessica found out.

130
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,735
Found out what?

131
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,504
Just told me he's a virgin.

132
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,073
That doesn't surprise me
one bit.

133
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,541
All in due time, Mike.

134
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,611
You have those
severance quotes?

Pearson Hardman
to see Mike Ross.

147
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,007
Uh, he expecting you?

148
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,609
No, I just was gonna
drop this off.

149
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,277
No appointment.
I can't let you up.

150
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:08,879
Do I look like a terrorist?

151
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:10,647
Do I look like I want
to lose my job?

154
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,386
Hey. You here to see Mike?

155
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,487
Sort of. I just...

156
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,488
I was gonna drop this suit
off for him.

157
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:18,856
Harvey called late last night,

158
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,124
some big emergency,

159
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,392
and Mike ended up staying
the night.

160
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,026
Actually, could you
help me out.

161
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,395
I'm running so late to work.

162
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:25,663
Sure.

163
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:26,998
Oh, my God. Thank you.

164
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,166
Oh.

165
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,167
Thanks.

166
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:30,668
- Thank you.
- Okay.

167
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,103
Oh!

168
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,505
And can you tell Mike that
I left the key under the mat?

169
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,073
Absolutely.

170
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,474
Thank you so much, Rachel.

171
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,644
- You're welcome.
- You're amazing.

172
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,625
Ahem.

173
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,730
Uh!

174
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:01,731
I'm up. I'm up.

175
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,166
Your girlfriend stopped by.

176
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,935
Dropped that off for you.

177
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,236
Girlfriend?

178
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,704
You guys move
in together already?

179
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,305
What? No.

180
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,441
We... she's not my...
why do you care?

181
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,575
I don't. What...

182
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,610
what was the big emergency
last night?

183
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,179
Um, Harvey.

184
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,381
He's firing some big vp from our
accounting firm this morning.

185
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,949
Stan Jacobson?

186
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,252
Yeah, why? You know him?

187
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:24,021
No, he was just checking in
at reception when I got there.

188
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,322
What?

189
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:27,458
Oh, my God! I got to change.

190
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:30,027
I will let him know
that you will be right there.

191
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:33,397
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,673
Performance numbers,
HR guidelines,

193
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,241
severance quotes,
and Stan's in the waiting room.

194
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,476
Did you sleep here last night?

195
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,977
I wouldn't exactly
call it sleeping.

196
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,312
Where'd you get that suit?

197
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,115
Uh, Rachel.

198
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:54,451
No, I mean Jenny gave it
to Rachel downstairs.

199
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,785
She slept over last night.

200
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,088
Jenny did, not Rachel.

201
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,791
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

202
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,392
You want to learn how
it's done, right?

203
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,729
I read this guy's employment
records, Harvey.

204
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,831
He's smart, talented, loyal.

205
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,832
Oh, and you feel bad for him.

206
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm shocked.

207
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,670
Where's my smoking gun?

208
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:11,971
Background check that
confirmed Stan lied

209
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,039
about his credentials.

210
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,275
It never came through.

211
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,611
On it.

212
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:20,247
Okay.

213
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,449
Come in, come in.

214
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,717
Um, could you help me
with something?

215
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,152
I need to get this fax
for Harvey and it's...

216
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:25,953
Good morning.

217
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,655
Good morning. He needs a...

218
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:28,656
You can tell, can't you?

219
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,825
I bet you everybody can.

220
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,029
Uh, tell what?

221
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,031
You... wax your eyebrows?

222
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,534
I was with the most beautiful
woman last night.

223
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,704
Uh, she wax your eyebrows?

224
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,406
We did a lot of things
last night

225
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,641
and waxing wasn't one of them,

226
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,510
if you know what I mean.

227
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,811
Oh, God.

228
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,780
Uh, well, that's great.
I'm here to ask...

229
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,481
Her name's Charisse
and we have so much in common.

230
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,751
And Mike, there was like this...

231
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,019
there was like this, "mmm."

232
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,153
Mm-mm.

233
00:08:58,188 --> 00:08:59,454
- Like a "mmm."
- Mm-mm.

234
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:00,522
Like a chemical thing
would happen

235
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,057
when our bodies would touch.

236
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,691
No, I really don't want to
have this conversation with you.

237
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,893
Oh, come on.
We're both guys, right?

238
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:06,995
Little locker room talk
around the office.

239
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,396
I mean, that creates
a little male bonding.

240
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,630
That's crazy.
I just heard my name.

241
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,399
Did you hear that?
Someone's calling me.

242
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,836
I'm gonna...
just one second, okay?

243
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,971
He's probably still a virgin.

244
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,305
Mr. Jacobson, hi.

245
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,440
Mike Ross, Harvey's associate.

246
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:20,641
So sorry to keep you waiting.

247
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,142
Just gonna be a couple
more minutes, okay?

248
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:24,545
Okay, great. Thank you.

249
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,846
Yes, I hear you.

250
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,248
Your office couldn't
find a copy.

251
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,016
Can you tell me the name
of the security firm

252
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,986
you guys used to do
the background check?

253
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,187
Okay, great.

254
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,388
Uh, nope. That's great.

255
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,657
I found the number myself.
Thank you.

256
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,858
Sally, yes.

257
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,593
This is Mike Ross
for Pearson Hardman.

258
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,529
I'm calling regarding
a background check you guys did.

259
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:43,563
Uh, sure.

260
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,998
You could refuse to cooperate,

261
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,200
but then you would be wrong.

262
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,402
Uh, Sally, hold on one minute.

263
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:50,904
Yeah?

264
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,105
Uh, no.

265
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,174
Stan is going to be there
in two minutes.

266
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,880
He's in the bathroom. Okay.

267
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,215
Sally, you there?

268
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,583
Let's do this.

269
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,419
Uh, I'm gonna fax you
the subpoena

270
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,120
that I'm holding
in my hand right now

271
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:09,425
and you can show that
to your boss and then we...

272
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,960
great.

273
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:14,363
Uh, let me send you
my fax number now.

274
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,398
Nice.

275
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,774
Stan.

276
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,209
Oh, hey. We ready?

277
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:29,777
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

278
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,646
No worries.

279
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,548
I know you, by the way.

280
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,252
7611053.

281
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,487
Your employee code.

282
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,889
See, I remember everyone
that way.

283
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,090
Ahh.

284
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:42,358
Anyway, you are taking me
to see Harvey.

285
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,660
I have been dying to meet him.

286
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:45,061
Why is that?

287
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:47,330
His balls.

288
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,065
His autographed ones.
I'm a huge baseball fan.

289
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,001
Oh, right. Really?

290
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,102
Oh, yeah, yeah. No.

291
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,203
If I wasn't an accountant,

292
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,805
I would be
a major league scout.

293
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,973
I can tell you anything
you want to know

294
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:58,008
just by looking
at somebody's numbers.

295
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,609
For instance,
slugging percentage

296
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,043
versus strikeouts during
spring training...

297
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,778
Do you want
to walk and talk maybe?

298
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,780
Ahh.

299
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,748
Yeah, I could write a book.

300
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,284
Stan Jacobson.

301
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,119
Mr. Specter, it is a pleasure.

302
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,788
Stan, it's nice to meet you.

303
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,256
- Has Mike alr...
- Oh, my God!

304
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,426
Oh, my God! Is that them?

305
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,795
Oh! Jeter.

306
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,030
Hank Aaron.

307
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,366
No way! Maris?

308
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,800
That's not number 61, is it?

309
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,469
No, but it was signed
by Tracy...

310
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,104
Stallard.

311
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,338
Ha-ha-ha!

312
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,474
Big baseball fan.

313
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,009
Stan, why don't you have
a seat over here?

314
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,778
Hey, why don't I get us
some waters?

315
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,980
Sorry.

316
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,149
I get talking about baseball,
I cannot stop.

317
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,152
Yeah, I know how valuable
your time is.

318
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,388
I <i>do</i> do the books.

319
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,557
And speaking of which,
your assistant tells me

320
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,092
you wanted to go over something
from your last audits.

321
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,629
I could really use a water.

322
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:56,565
Stan, we're not here to go
over any accounting business.

323
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,735
You're here because
you're being let go.

324
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,869
What?

325
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:02,271
It's not gonna feel
that surprising

326
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,739
when you understand why.

327
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,241
The firm looked into your
background recently.

328
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,142
They know you lied about
passing the CPA exam.

329
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:11,579
You were hired because of your
outstanding credentials

330
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:15,416
and the reality is
they never existed.

331
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,088
I've been there for nine years.

332
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:23,157
My work has been nothing but...

333
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,659
I mean, why would this
even matter now?

334
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,594
You have been committing fraud
your entire career.

335
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,062
The liability it presents...

336
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,597
No! I don't accept this.

337
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:31,798
Okay, take a deep breath.

338
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,500
Once you go over
the severance numbers,

339
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,501
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

340
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:39,072
Fair?

341
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,307
You think this is fair?

342
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,843
We understand how difficult
this must be, Stan.

343
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,211
How you must feel right now.

344
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:48,614
You have no idea what
I feel right now.

345
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:50,617
Just so I'm clear...

346
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,720
you're not denying what we're
presenting you with?

347
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:57,991
You mean that I lied
back when Drybeck hired me?

348
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,298
No.

349
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:05,566
But I'm not some
scam artist either.

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,801
I did go to college.

351
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,237
I just...
couldn't afford to graduate.

352
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,404
No one ever
questioned it before

353
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,077
because I'm that good
with numbers.

354
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,980
Then they find out
all of a sudden.

355
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,082
They didn't.

356
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:24,752
This background check
is five years old.

357
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:26,754
What?

358
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:28,389
That doesn't make sense.

359
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:30,390
Is this the original?

360
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,125
Yeah.

361
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,866
So Tori knew... all this time?

362
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,935
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

363
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,937
- Who?
- Paula.

364
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,405
Discovered some
undisclosed income,

365
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,674
the books weren't adding up,
she brought it to me.

366
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,143
The next thing I know,
she is gone.

367
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,578
I asked Tori about it,
then I start

368
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:49,846
getting shut out of meetings.

369
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,980
They're trying
to hide something

370
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:52,515
and they're firing me
so they can.

371
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,350
Hey, where are you going?

372
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:55,484
I'm not signing some agreement.

373
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:56,752
Are you kidding me?

374
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:59,254
I'm getting railroaded!

375
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:01,022
- Should I go after him?
- No.

376
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:04,692
You've done enough already.

377
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,375
So you let him leave?

378
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,943
Physically restraining someone

379
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,812
is not in my job description.

380
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:14,748
Well, what about
your associate,

381
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,650
the one who shared
the background check?

382
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,220
That was a confidential
internal document.

383
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:20,321
Stan should have never seen it.

384
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,290
Why did you even have it?

385
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,159
You didn't expect us to fire
him without proof, did you?

386
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:26,928
Tori's right.
Stan shouldn't have seen it.

387
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,362
Then I'm guilty
of being thorough.

388
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:29,964
Hey, I still don't understand
why you haven't

389
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,165
told us the whole truth.

390
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,133
I mean, if you knew
five years ago,

391
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,634
why'd you make it sound like
this is something recent?

392
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,636
Because it only came
to my attention two days ago.

393
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,004
Then who ordered
the background check?

394
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,473
It's routine.
You check with human resources.

395
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,608
Is it routine
for human resources

396
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:45,610
to keep something from
the CEO for half a decade?

397
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,312
What are you insinuating?

398
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,781
I think what Harvey
is saying is given

399
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:53,218
how quickly we tried
to accomplish this,

400
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,519
some of the details
might have gotten lost.

401
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,522
What was also lost is that Stan

402
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,458
never signed
the severance package,

403
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,593
which included
the confidentiality agreement,

404
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:01,861
which means if he decides
to make waves,

405
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,264
the whole point of avoiding
negative publicity...

406
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,966
Harvey will track down Stan

407
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,702
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

408
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,705
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

409
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:14,809
You have my word.

410
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,277
Thank you.

411
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,313
Of course.

412
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:27,021
It's allight, Tori.

413
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,390
She's lying.

414
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,391
She knew about Stan.

415
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,826
She's known for a long time.

416
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,294
And that matters to us why?

417
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:34,962
Because she's taking
advantage of us.

418
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,630
We are being manipulated
into firing

419
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,166
one of her employees and told
not to ask questions.

420
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,567
Well, I have questions.

421
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,403
And the answer is ten.

422
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:46,139
As in $10 million per year...

423
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:49,643
the amount of business Drybeck
generates for this firm.

424
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:52,780
Which means you have
to finish what you started.

425
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:56,551
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

426
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,019
Oh, and as far as
I'm concerned,

427
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:00,222
that little associate of yours
iso blame for all of this.

428
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:01,390
That was an honest mistake.

429
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:02,892
He knowingly revealed

430
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,894
the client's
confidential document.

431
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:08,698
That is not a mistake.

432
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,899
How many more chances
are you gonna give that kid?

433
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,602
Oh, I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

434
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,837
But if that's the case,
I still think

435
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,471
he's coming out ahead.

436
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:28,616
Whatever you're doing, stop.

437
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,151
Wait, you're gonna want
to see this.

438
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,788
Paula O'Neil, the former Drybeck
employee that Stan mentioned,

439
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,857
she filed a wrongful
termination suit

440
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,025
that mysteriously went away.

441
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,530
Really? Let me see that.

442
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:44,401
Come with me.

443
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,702
Wait.

444
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:46,937
Do you not think something
funny's going on?

445
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,004
You know what?

446
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,605
Here's what I think
is going on.

447
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,606
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

448
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:51,941
That doesn't mean that...

449
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,142
You need to learn something
from what just happened,

450
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:55,277
not the least of which
is how anyone,

451
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,379
no matter how valuable,
can be let go.

452
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:59,047
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

453
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,716
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

454
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,984
So if you want to work here,
you better go home now,

455
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:05,219
because if she sees you...
Wait, wait.

456
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:06,286
Is she gonna fire me?

457
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,688
This habit of you empathizing

458
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,724
with every client,
it's not getting you anywhere.

459
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,959
You want to work in this firm?

460
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,895
You need to deal in facts,
evidence,

461
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,664
information that can hold up.

462
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:18,968
That's what a real lawyer does.

463
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:39,188
Stan.

464
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,856
Did you follow me here?

465
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,491
Doesn't take a sleuth
to figure out

466
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:45,460
that your next step would be
to see another lawyer.

467
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,562
Bopal and Williams.

468
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:50,365
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

469
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,533
They called you.

470
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:52,735
That is against lawyer-client
privilege.

471
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,136
No one's breaking any laws,
okay?

472
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,671
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

473
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,206
that tell her anything
she wants to know,

474
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,675
like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

475
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,243
You forgot this when you left.

476
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:03,878
I said I'm not
signing anything.

477
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:05,480
It's nothing to sign.

478
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,881
It's a lawsuit.

479
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,718
You worked for Drybeck
for 9 years,

480
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:12,854
oversaw 80 clients,
filed hundreds of tax returns,

481
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,189
and fought 27 audits.

482
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:17,459
Now, in light of your recently
discovered fraud,

483
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,360
all of that can now
be called into question.

484
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:23,330
Therefore, you are being sued
for nine years back pay,

485
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:26,534
plus any expenses incurred to
mitigate the damage you've done.

486
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,637
This is...

487
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,405
this would bankrupt me.

488
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,008
Or you can take
what's behind door number two.

489
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,413
- It's Aberdeen.
- Who?

490
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,915
It's not a "Who."
It's a "What."

491
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,383
Drybeck is doing business
with them

492
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,584
and I think that's where
the problem lies.

493
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,886
You don't get it, okay?

494
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,654
I'm only leaving with
one of these,

495
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,389
and if it's the lawsuit,

496
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,957
the first thing your friends
upstairs

497
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,859
are gonna ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

498
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,728
And when you tell them
that Harvey Specter

499
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:55,096
is the one that's suing you,

500
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:57,131
you're gonna watch the color
drain from their faces.

501
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:01,703
Now what would you like to do?

502
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,407
This is not cool.

503
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,875
You leave me in
your apartment all night

504
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,310
and say you're gonna
be right back.

505
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,245
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

506
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,514
I had a bad day, Jenny.

507
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,682
So you couldn't call me?

508
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,949
I almost got fired, okay?

509
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,051
What happened?

510
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:21,354
It... it's not worth explaining.

511
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,056
Okay.

512
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,224
I need to find evidence

513
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:25,826
that our accounting firm
is up to something,

514
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,563
so I found this woman who filed
a wrongful termination suit

515
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:30,498
against them, but then
she referred me to her lawyer.

516
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,799
Did you call them?

517
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,068
Yeah, but they're
this huge firm.

518
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,269
Unger and Macy.

519
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,104
They wouldn't take my call.

520
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:37,440
Why not?

521
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:38,541
There's
a confidentiality clause

522
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,209
in the settlement, for one.

523
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:41,745
So?

524
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,349
So it means that they can't
share details like that.

525
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,483
You know, I thought all lawyers

526
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,218
secretly shared that stuff.

527
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,355
You're all in the same club,
right?

528
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,423
What?

529
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:54,691
That's not a dumb thing
to assume.

530
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:55,759
No, no, no, no.

531
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:59,662
That's not dumb at all,
because...

532
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,996
We all are in the same club.

533
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,832
Unger and Macy have almost
as many Harvard grads

534
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,133
as we do, which means...

535
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:06,902
They're gonna be
at the mixer tonight.

536
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:08,938
And there are two things
that lawyers love to do.

537
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,472
Drink and talk.

538
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,411
- Hi.
- Hi.

539
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:17,280
Uh, Mike Ross, class of 2011.

540
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:18,748
Ross.

541
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:19,950
Sorry, I don't have you on here.

542
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,018
Do you have your I.D.?

543
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,152
I can run it through
the computer.

544
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,387
Uh, my Harvard I.D.?

545
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,890
What did you say your name
was again?

546
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,360
Michael Ross
of Pearson Hardman.

547
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,663
Boy, you think they ask Harvey
for his I.D.

548
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,565
when he comes to this place?

549
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,666
Harvey Specter?

550
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,403
You work with Harvey Specter?

551
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,971
Uh, yeah, yes.

552
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,306
I'm his associate.

553
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,075
I can call him if you like.

554
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,980
Just don't tell him
I gave you any trouble, okay?

555
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,148
Welcome.

556
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,284
Thank you.

557
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,152
Mmm.

558
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:54,155
Oh, God.
I'm never gonna survive this.

559
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:58,426
Deep breaths. You'll be fine.

560
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,873
Hey.

561
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:12,207
I saw the signed severance
papers on my desk.

562
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:15,143
- Thank you.
- And I also left word for Tori.

563
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,344
Yes, we spoke.

564
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:17,778
She's relieved,
but I wouldn't go so far

565
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:19,513
as to say completely forgiving.

566
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:22,016
You ever heard
of Aberdeen Solutions?

567
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,284
Drybeck listed them
as a consultant firm.

568
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:26,453
They bill us every month
for their management services.

569
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,122
Okay.

570
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,456
What does that mean?

571
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,559
- Check with accounting.
- I did.

572
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:33,961
They can only tell me
how much we pay them,

573
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:35,997
so I called Aberdeen directly.

574
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,599
It's an automated
answering system.

575
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:40,235
I left six messages.
No returns.

576
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,037
Stan mentioned it.

577
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,441
Something just doesn't
feel right.

578
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:47,376
Are you saying you want
to investigate our client?

579
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,643
They're also our accountants.

580
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:52,080
And Tori is also a friend.

581
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,948
Harvey, if you got caught...

582
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:58,219
I wouldn't get caught.

583
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:03,291
I am explicitly telling you
not to do this.

584
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,692
Well, then I'll let you know
what I don't find

585
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:09,229
after I don't look into it.

586
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,838
Hey, should we get the rest
of the 2010 grads

587
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,473
with us for a pic?

588
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,375
The rest? This is 2011. No way.

589
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,213
Isn't he from the 2010 class?

590
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,916
No, no. I was 2011.

591
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,019
You're not with us.

592
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:40,587
Yeah, Rudy... It's Mike.

593
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:42,423
You know, we...
we hung out a bunch.

594
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,492
Where?

595
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:45,760
Oh, you know what?

596
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:46,961
Maybe I'm thinking about
somebody else.

597
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:48,295
Sorry about that.

598
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,934
Has anyone seen that guy
here before?

599
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,169
Hey.

600
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:56,637
I'm not having any luck.

601
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,039
Wish I could
say different, love.

602
00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,640
But it's been a Potter's Field
for me too.

603
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:00,775
What?

604
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,444
You get to pretend
to be someone else.

605
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,946
I wanted to try. It's fun.

606
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,649
Accent? Hmm.

607
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:09,285
Okay, I'll stop.

608
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,687
What?

609
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,591
You're amazing.

610
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,561
And that's Brian Jennings.

611
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,496
Who's Brian Jennings?

612
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,698
I saw his face on
Unger and Macy's website today.

613
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,400
What are you waiting for? Go.

614
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,176
Hi.

615
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,746
Ten days for public exposure.

616
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,815
Next time you need a bathroom
in Times Square,

617
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,483
go into a hotel.

618
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,253
Five-minute recess.

619
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,261
Harvey.

620
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,695
Long time, Anthony.

621
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,863
Heh.

622
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:52,898
You keep company
with the high rollers

623
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,066
on Center Street.

624
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,135
What are you doing down
in night court?

625
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,770
I need a favor.

626
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,206
What kind of favor?

627
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,341
One that requires access
to sealed court documents.

628
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,310
Can it wait till tomorrow?

629
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,778
I got this backlog of case...

630
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,980
When you came to me two years
ago in the middle of the night,

631
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:13,184
did I tell you it
had to wait till tomorrow?

632
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:17,322
My chambers.

633
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,591
So... this is quite a surprise.

634
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,293
Who'd ever think that you and
I would on a double date?

635
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,462
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

636
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,797
You had to notice when you
walked in the room.

637
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,298
She's absolutely gorgeous.

638
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,967
And she's completely infatuated
with your girlfriend.

639
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,368
Ah.

640
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,637
Come on.

641
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,804
Come on, I'll introduce you
to her.

642
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,040
Charisse, honey...

643
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,075
uh, this is one
of my associates, Mike Ross.

644
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,543
Oh, so nice to meet you.

645
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,345
And I'm in love with your date.

646
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,746
Seriously.

647
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,547
She's just been telling me about
her work with monkeys.

648
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:46,049
It's fascinating. Huh?

649
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,084
So really,
they're as smart as us?

650
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:49,919
Oh, smarter.

651
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:53,022
I never had a chance with him.

652
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,924
I need to use the ladies' room.

653
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,593
Would you excuse me?

654
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,429
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans, sorry.

655
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,499
That depends on which humans
you're talking about, I guess.

656
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,635
- What?
- Huh?

657
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,403
Name of case and rough date?

658
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,506
Aberdeen versus Paula O'Neill,

659
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,675
say six months ago.

660
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,677
Oh, let's see.

661
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,213
Says here that they were
listed as a subsidiary

662
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,248
of Drybeck in a wrongful
termination suit.

663
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,749
That's it.
That's what I'm looking for.

664
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,018
I can't print this out.
I'll get tagged.

665
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,621
Come around. Take a look.

666
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,722
Is that what you're after?

667
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,456
Yeah, that's it.

668
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:31,594
But what's that?

669
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,663
That links to another
court filing

670
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,231
in relation to Aberdeen.

671
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,601
Click on it.

672
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,670
Says here that they filed
for dissolution...

673
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,405
earlier today.

674
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,507
The whole company?

675
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,242
That's what it says.

676
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,644
They're officially shut down.

677
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:50,249
I'm gonna need one more favor.

678
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:51,884
I think it's great
that you found someone

679
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,252
not in law who works out
in the real world.

680
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,954
Why do you say that?

681
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,989
Because I'm stuck
in a suit all day

682
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,624
or an office or a courtroom.

683
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,292
I think it'd be nice
to be in nature.

684
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,626
Don't you, Mike?

685
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,961
Well, I love that
you're a lawyer.

686
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:08,833
In fact, I'd love to see
where you work sometime.

687
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,001
You would?

688
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,003
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

689
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,171
- No.
- Yeah.

690
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,272
You think we can go?

691
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,574
- Yeah.
- Right now?

692
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,808
Now. Yeah.

693
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,043
- So great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

694
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,044
Have good night.

695
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,347
- Bye.
- Bye.

696
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,416
Okay, why didn't you
do that sooner?

697
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,853
Because...
I had to get this first.

698
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,488
That's the guy, right?
From the firm.

699
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:30,690
That's his employee I.D.

700
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,258
- He gave this to you?
- No, I stole it.

701
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,460
What?

702
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,796
Listen, you could spend all
night trying to get to the guy

703
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,365
or you could just go into
his firm yourself and look.

704
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,499
Come on.

705
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:41,600
Let's go.

706
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,443
Yeah, I can barely keep
my eyes open myself.

707
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:54,212
Filing briefs sucks.

708
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,342
You actually came.

709
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:25,410
You must be Harvey Specter.

710
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,536
"Joe," was it?

711
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,071
Your friend fill you in on
the deal that's on the table?

712
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,506
Let me just get it straight.

713
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,108
You caught him rifling
through some files,

714
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,609
and in lieu of calling
the police,

715
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:35,644
you want me to pay you off?

716
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:37,545
I never said that.

717
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:38,746
He did.

718
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,548
Oh, that's great.

719
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,717
This way, if I level
a charge of extortion,

720
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,418
it's hearsay, huh?

721
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,053
Ten years working
for a law firm,

722
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,754
you learn a thing or two,
which is good,

723
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:49,922
'cause you sure as hell don't
make a lot of money doing it.

724
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:51,391
Somehow I think you're
getting by fine.

725
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,827
Just saying, on the level
you guys play at,

726
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:56,596
espionage happens all the time,
which is why I know

727
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,399
you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

728
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:02,203
Well actually, Joe Speena,
of 2561 Clover Lane,

729
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:04,572
Astoria, Queens,
I think we all would.

730
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,940
Like those tax returns
you filed jointly

731
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,943
for the last six years while
no longer living with your wife.

732
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,012
You know, the IRS
can destroy you for that.

733
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:15,215
You think you're the first
person to try to extort me, Joe?

734
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:16,782
'Cause that's the level
I play at.

735
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:18,985
Now... You're a security guard

736
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:20,820
who likes to take risks.

737
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:21,954
I like that.

738
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:23,122
So here's what we're gonna do.

739
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:25,124
This here's a generous donation

740
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,293
to Joey junior's
little league team.

741
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:28,895
Now, if it gets to them,
it gets to them.

742
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,530
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

743
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:32,532
But the next time we talk,

744
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:35,301
it's gonna be me
who wants a favor.

745
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:41,642
Officer.

746
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,477
Do I really
need to pay you back?

747
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,079
Let's start
with an explanation.

748
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,748
You said I needed
to find evidence,

749
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:48,915
so I went to find some.

750
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:50,450
By breaking into
another law firm?

751
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:52,585
Is that really worse than
paying off a security guard?

752
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,320
Okay, first of all,
I didn't pay him off.

753
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:55,788
Second of all,
if I hadn't paid him off,

754
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:58,491
you'd be in jail right now.

755
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,826
You think I might
be right about Stan.

756
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,494
No, I never said
you were wrong.

757
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:03,529
I said we needed evidence.

758
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:05,798
But did you find something?

759
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:09,569
Drybeck bought
a shelf company 13 months ago.

760
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:11,504
What's a shelf company?

761
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:14,140
It's a corporation
that exists only on paper,

762
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:16,709
so its owners can hide
their assets.

763
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:17,710
Isn't that a shell company?

764
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:19,379
No, it's a shelf company.

765
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:22,081
Okay, take a shell company,
give it a bank account,

766
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:24,083
credit history, tax returns,

767
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:27,454
and let it season for years
on a shelf.

768
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:29,757
Someone buys it,
slots their name into it,

769
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,627
and they walk away with
an established corporation

770
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:34,529
with a preexisting history.

771
00:29:34,563 --> 00:29:35,597
Anyone looks any closer,

772
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:37,299
they shut it down
and do it again.

773
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,734
That's legal?

774
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,269
Shelf companies are legal.

775
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm guessing what Tori's
doing with hers isn't.

776
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:45,376
Wait a minute.
Is it called "Aberdeen"?

777
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,877
Yeah, I saw it on the top
of this list

778
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,913
with 37 other
management companies

779
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:54,151
all related to Drybeck in
that wrongful termination suit.

780
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:55,452
When we get back to the office,

781
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:56,787
I want you to find
legal precedent

782
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:58,888
that will allow us
to subpoena the records.

783
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,423
Okay, on it.

784
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:01,924
Do I really have
to pay you back?

785
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,126
Every penny.

786
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,760
Wait a minute.

787
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:07,430
How much was in that envelope?

788
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,003
Hey, what are you all doing
at my desk?

789
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,605
Dude, you got to check
this out.

790
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:25,445
Excuse me. Excuse me.

791
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,746
Is that Louis?

792
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,080
Uh-huh. In the lobby.

793
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:30,116
Is this a security camera?
A live feed?

794
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,217
- What are you guys doing?
- No, no.

795
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:32,619
This is from last night.

796
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:33,987
The guys in security emailed it
up to Louis this morning.

797
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:36,656
And why are we watching it
on my computer?

798
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:38,658
Well, we're not gonna risk
watching it on one of ours.

799
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:39,827
And everyone knows
your password.

800
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:41,928
How does everybody
know my password?

801
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,229
"Ross999."

802
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,198
How hard is that to crack?

803
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:46,866
Okay, "999" increases
the odds of...

804
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,535
Oh, shh! Here it comes.

805
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:50,970
What?

806
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,208
Oh, no.

807
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,809
What did he say to her?

808
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:01,011
Oh, evidently Louis wants
a restraining order

809
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:02,413
and he needs this as evidence.

810
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:03,814
Oh.

811
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:05,349
What?

812
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:07,752
Uh, um, it...

813
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:10,088
okay, listen. Please don't.

814
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:12,057
I came in here and it...

815
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:14,059
look, I...

816
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:15,361
are you okay now?

817
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:19,866
Louis?

818
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:23,804
If the message you left
was another trick

819
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:25,172
to get me down here...

820
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:26,773
No tricks, I assure you.
Come on in.

821
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:27,940
Stan, I'm Jessica Pearson.

822
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:29,575
Oh, yeah. I know who you are.

823
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,744
You said if I accepted
the severance agreement,

824
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,045
there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

825
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,513
Well, there is one,

826
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,248
but not against you.

827
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:37,782
With you.

828
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,217
We know about Aberdeen.

829
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:41,085
We know what Tori
was orchestrating.

830
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,454
And with your help,
we can expose her.

831
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,393
Why should I help you?

832
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:53,296
What have you got to lose?

833
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,267
Tell me what you need me to do.

834
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:05,875
Hey.

835
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,976
What does he have you
trying to find this time?

836
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:12,847
You really want to know?

837
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:14,883
Uh, I managed
to get a look at some files

838
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,618
involving our accounting firm.

839
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:18,787
What's up with
our accounting firm?

840
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,755
They're stealing from us.

841
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,257
You know your phone bill?

842
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,825
You have all those surcharges,

843
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,326
you have no idea what they mean,
but you pay 'em anyway.

844
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,727
Yeah.

845
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:28,895
Yeah, well, Drybeck's doing
the same thing to us,

846
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:31,595
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

847
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,541
Pretty sure the phone
charges are a scam too.

848
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, maybe.

849
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,736
So what do you need?

850
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,138
I need a legal reason
to get those files

851
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:43,241
without saying
I saw those files.

852
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:46,144
You need them for court
or you just need them?

853
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,347
Why?

854
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:49,748
You said you read 'em, right?

855
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:50,783
Yeah.

856
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:53,286
So then you already
have them...

857
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,321
in here.

858
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:56,756
You're right. I do.

859
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,925
Yes, so you dictate, I'll type.

860
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
What?

861
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,963
You'd actually do that for me?

862
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,198
They're stealing from us.

863
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,967
Person Hardman is my firm too.

864
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,302
Come on.

865
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:10,971
Okay.

866
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,273
With the party
of the third part,

867
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:15,442
hereto referred
to as Norton LLC...

868
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:19,367
any claim that might
reasonably be anticipated...

869
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:20,769
we acknowledge that such
appointment

870
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:22,770
is irrevocable
and shall be deemed...

871
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,206
lawfully invested with
the power to make such contracts

872
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,733
or to perform acts from which
can be lawfully implied.

873
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:32,954
That's it. Did we get it?

874
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,138
Saving and wait for it...

875
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,907
Done.

876
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,408
Oh.

877
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:44,581
What?

878
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:46,817
Your mind.

879
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:49,786
It's just... it's amazing.

880
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,655
Thanks.

881
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:53,423
What?

882
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,258
Your mind's amazing too.

883
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:57,827
Oh, thank you.

884
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:00,063
Thank you.

885
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:01,498
Who you calling this late?

886
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:02,932
Oh.

887
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,367
She's waiting up for you?

888
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,402
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's pretty late.

889
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:07,937
She's probably sleeping by now.

890
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,205
I'll just text her.

891
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,041
It's tough to have
a relationship

892
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:13,544
with the first year
or any year.

893
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:15,546
You just don't have a life.

894
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:17,015
How'd you make it work?

895
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:18,617
Who said I did?

896
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,520
It's... it's impossible
to have anything long-term

897
00:34:21,555 --> 00:34:22,822
unless you find someone
that has the same

898
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:25,691
80-hour work week and then...

899
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:27,960
that doesn't work either,
because they're busy too.

900
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:29,962
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
let that be the reason

901
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:32,998
that Jenny and I don't...

902
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:45,610
What are you two
still doing here?

903
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,212
- Uh, it's for Harvey.
- Nothing.

904
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:48,647
- Uh, but we're done.
- Good night.

905
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:49,882
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
- Good night.

906
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:50,950
- Bye.
- Bye.

907
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:57,257
I'm sure you're aware of this,

908
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:00,160
but, um, I'm just gonna
remind you anyway.

909
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:04,098
Um, this office frowns upon
relationships in the workplace.

910
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:07,134
Yeah.

911
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,366
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

912
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
That's okay.

913
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:34,135
Um... Hey.

914
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,772
Uh, thank you for last night.

915
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,441
The typing.

916
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:39,809
- Of course... right.
- Yeah.

917
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,278
- Absolutely.
- It was really helpful.

918
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:42,345
Mm-hmm.

919
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:45,616
Um, hold on one second.

920
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,551
Sorry. Hello?

921
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:48,786
I said I needed you
in my office.

922
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,920
And I said I was on my way.

923
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,756
Save it. Those the files?

924
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,324
Yes, take them, please.

925
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,425
Stan is in my office.

926
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,560
Meet us in the conference room.

927
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:58,696
Okay.

928
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,164
Yeah.

929
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,365
Sorry to keep you waiting.

930
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,433
That's okay.

931
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:03,834
I got your email

932
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,736
with a list of other law firms.

933
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,371
I respect your effort
to make amends

934
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,639
by referring new clients.

935
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:11,341
That wasn't a list
for client referrals.

936
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:12,876
Those are firms you should
consider for representation.

937
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,710
We're no longer
your attorneys, Tori.

938
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:16,045
What?

939
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,346
We have no choice really.

940
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,915
It would be impossible
to represent you

941
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,217
when we plan on suing you
for every penny you've got.

942
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,186
Is this a joke?

943
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,655
Aberdeen Solutions.

944
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,556
Created in June of 2006.

945
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:28,758
Sold to Drybeck 2010.

946
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:30,460
Dissolved two days ago.

947
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:32,529
Before that,
it was Bolton Finances.

948
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:34,030
And before that,
it was Norton Services,

949
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,465
Littleton LLC.

950
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,467
Where did you get those?

951
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,202
We know what you did, Tori.

952
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:39,503
You couldn't have subpoenaed
these files.

953
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:40,971
And yet we have them.

954
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:42,206
Take a look. They're all there.

955
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,442
- And now we have proof.
- Proof of what?

956
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:46,812
Those are all legitimate
corporations used for...

957
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:48,948
Stealing money
and lining your own pockets.

958
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,850
But don't take my word for it.

959
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:53,887
Guys?

960
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,060
Hello, Tori.

961
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,563
Yeah, we hired Stan to do
a little independent consulting

962
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:04,464
on our behalf and he's come

963
00:37:04,499 --> 00:37:06,300
with some very interesting
connections.

964
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,869
It was easy, even if I don't
really have a degree.

965
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:13,241
There was that vacation
you invited me on last year...

966
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,243
to your new house
in the Bahamas.

967
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:18,145
A house you bought with money
you stole from this firm.

968
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:20,181
My firm.

969
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,182
Jessica...

970
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:22,750
"Jessica" what?

971
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,752
You can't use any of this.

972
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:27,021
We have attorney-client
privilege.

973
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:28,422
With Drybeck Accounting, yes.

974
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:30,891
With the shelf companies? No.

975
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:32,126
And unfortunately for you,

976
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,428
you're listed
on the shelf companies.

977
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,663
You stole from me.

978
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,866
You either come clean now
or the only time

979
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,135
you'll see your children
in the next decade

980
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,704
will be during prison
visiting hours.

981
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,278
So I'm gonna get
my job back now, right?

982
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,846
I don't see why not.

983
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:53,448
No, Stan, you're not.

984
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,017
What?

985
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,753
Drybeck's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

986
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,089
Even if they don't,
they're not gonna hire you back.

987
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,859
Why?

988
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:08,766
Because you falsified
your resume.

989
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,668
What am I supposed to do now?

990
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:13,038
Well, we just got your more
than your severance package.

991
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:15,574
I suggest you use it
to tide yourself over

992
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:19,778
till you figure something out.

993
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:32,858
Stan... Hey.

994
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,494
Your best asset is your mind.

995
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:38,330
They can't take that from you.

996
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:39,598
One little mistake.

997
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:43,668
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

998
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,637
Start over?

999
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,543
I never should have done it.

1000
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,833
Told you they wouldn't
catch me.

1001
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,802
What are you looking for,
Harvey?

1002
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:20,437
- Positive reinforcement?
- Nothing major.

1003
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,471
A trophy, Nobel.

1004
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:25,041
Would your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

1005
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:27,210
Bust or life-size?

1006
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,545
You did a good thing, Harvey.

1007
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,482
Well, it wasn't just me,
you know?

1008
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:35,084
Well, then I guess
I should give the kid

1009
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,286
the benefit of the doubt
from now on.

1010
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:41,790
You should.

1011
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:56,439
Well, you'll be happy to know

1012
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:58,207
that Stan has no idea
what he's gonna do

1013
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:59,375
with the rest of his life.

1014
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:02,645
That doesn't make me happy.

1015
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,281
Well, what if I tell you
I have no idea

1016
00:40:04,315 --> 00:40:08,386
what I'm doing with mine?

1017
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,257
What the hell are we gonna do
when I get caught, Harvey?

1018
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,358
You're not gonna get caught.

1019
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:17,428
That's your answer?

1020
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:22,632
What else is there?

1021
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,834
Why?

1022
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:25,969
What?

1023
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,703
Hire me.
Why would you do that to me?

1024
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:29,938
You mean <i>for</i> you.

1025
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,073
No, I don't.

1026
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,174
You made it perfectly clear

1027
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,341
that you only do things
for yourself.

1028
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:34,676
So why?

1029
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,745
You mean the reason why
I became a lawyer

1030
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:39,548
or your friend dealt drugs
or you used to cheat?

1031
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,049
I cheated because I needed...

1032
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,183
You couldn't make money
any other way?

1033
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,753
Bullshit.

1034
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:47,355
Life is this.

1035
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:49,724
I like this.

1036
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,258
That's not me.

1037
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,628
Well, if it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

1038
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:54,929
So if you want this to stop,

1039
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:57,431
all you got to do is tap out.

1040
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,512
- Hello.
- Oh.

1041
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:14,080
You're here to see Mike.

1042
00:41:14,114 --> 00:41:15,948
We're gonna celebrate
his victory.

1043
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:19,319
Ah.

1044
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,488
You know, I actually think
that it's a really,

1045
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,090
really good idea that
you've come to pick him up.

1046
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,992
In fact, if I were you,

1047
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:26,260
I'd do it a little more often.

1048
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:29,397
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel.

1049
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:31,766
What do you mean?

1050
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,568
What do I...

1051
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,505
Well, come on.
You're a smart girl.

1052
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,740
You understand animal behavior.

1053
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:40,442
I think you can figure it out.

1054
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,680
Hey. You ready?

1055
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,849
Yeah.
