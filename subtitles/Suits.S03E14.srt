Well is that it?
Are we done.

168

Harvey, you've signed
three checks.

169
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,469
And?

170
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,272
Just go.

171
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,174
Oh, by the way,
how's Mike Ross doing?

172
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,393
What are you talking about?

173
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,527
He just came up
with the huge Stemple solution.

174
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,029
He's doing great.

175
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,698
So I guess he didn't tell you
about our little conversation?

176
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,683
What conversation?

177
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,684
The one where he ran
into the fact

178
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,236
that he has a glass ceiling.

179
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
Mike knows he has
a glass ceiling.

180
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:07,874
He knows,
but he didn't <i>know.</i>

181
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,910
We have a problem
with William Beck.

182
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,161
Who's William Beck?

183
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,697
Division head
of Coastal Radiance Sunscreen.

184
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,549
He's trying to break
his contract.

185
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,551
I assume he has
a non-compete.

186
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,870
No, Harvey, I was dumb enough
to let him do whatever he wants.

187
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:21,871
Why is he trying to leave?

188
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:23,222
He has some ideas

189
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:26,092
about the product line
that we're not implementing.

190
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,376
Does he have another offer?

191
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,895
- Neutrogena wants him.
- They can't have him.

192
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,459
He can go work at Starbucks, but
he's not touching this market.

193
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:33,900
Excuse me,
but maybe there's a solution.

194
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:37,103
Coastal Radiance is a division
of Pure Moisture Skincare.

195
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:38,220
Spin them off.

196
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,356
Beck gets to run
his own company,

197
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,575
both stocks go up,
everybody wins.

198
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,693
If I had wanted
the junior associate

199
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,264
to come up with an idea,
I'd have asked

200
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,114
the junior associate
to come up with an idea.

201
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,116
Tony, he's not wrong.

202
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,952
Coastal Radiance is undervalued,
and this fixes that.

203
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,254
Beck has been with us
for ten years.

204
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,419
Maybe it's worth running
the numbers on the spin-off.

205
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,175
I don't want
to run the numbers.

206
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:00,743
I want him out now.

207
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,129
So have your boy work up
the exit paperwork.

208
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,580
Jonathan will sign off.

209
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,599
Your company, your call.

210
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,522
You want to talk about
what just happened in there?

211
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,256
Not particularly.

212
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:15,942
Look, it was a good idea.
He should've listened to it.

213
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,310
I know it was a good idea.

214
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,427
What I don't know
is why you didn't push back.

215
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,980
Were you in there?
I did push back.

216
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,149
When you push back,
you change people's minds,

217
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,034
which means either
you didn't agree with me

218
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,769
or you don't care enough
to change his mind.

219
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,988
Look, I know when it's time
to change someone's mind

220
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:30,406
and when it isn't,

221
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,074
and all pushing harder
in that meeting would've done

222
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:33,242
was make him dig in.

223
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,294
We had an ally.
Jonathan agreed with me.

224
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,246
Yeah, and then he agreed
with his boss,

225
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,748
which is what we're gonna do,

226
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,916
because it's the way
the world works.

227
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,417
- Come on, Harvey.
- Mike.

228
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:45,471
This man goes through lawyers
like a hot knife through butter,

229
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:47,056
and I wasn't
about to get us fired

230
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,758
to protect some guy
I don't even give a shit about.

231
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:49,759
Now are you on board
with that?

232
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm on board.
Can we move on?

233
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,262
- I have nothing to move on to.
- I do.

234
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,431
Have you called Scottie
and apologized yet?

235
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,482
Apologize for what?

236
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,934
What are you,
the apology police?

237
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,235
If you're the one
under investigation,

238
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,520
I'll sign up for that.

239
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:03,439
Jessica, if you need me
to sign any more checks,

240
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,640
now would be a great time.
It's Louis.

241
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:05,858
Let me guess.

242
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,326
Even though he didn't
show up to the meeting,

243
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,111
he's feeling left out
and throwing a hissy fit.

244
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,147
He had a heart attack
in court this morning.

245
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,538
Oh, my God.

246
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:20,039
He's okay.

247
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:22,825
I made a call, he's got the best
cardiologists at Mount Sinai,

248
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,994
and they say
he's going to be fine.

249
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,930
We should go see him.

250
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,599
He told Norma
he didn't want anybody to come.

251
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,168
That means he's embarrassed,
but he wants me there.

252
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,356
I'll be back
when I'm back.

253
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,611
We handle
all his cases personally.

254
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,197
Nothing with Louis' name on it
falls through the cracks.

255
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,616
No client finds out
this happened.

256
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,534
- Done.
- Done.

257
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,070
I'll send him flowers
from all of us.

258
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,622
No.

259
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,574
He's allergic.

260
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,576
To flowers?

261
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,077
All of them?

262
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,996
How do you even know that?

263
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,048
I used to send them
to his desk every day

264
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:03,532
when we were associates.

265
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,384
I know.

266
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,670
I'm an asshole.

267
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,223
Hey.
He's gonna be okay, right?

268
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,895
Oh, my God.

269
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,047
This is awful.

270
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:20,566
Yeah, I know.

271
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,051
All morning all I've been
thinking about is how

272
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:24,053
I don't want to talk to him
about the tuition, and now--

273
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:26,822
Hey, Rachel, Rachel.
Hey, come on.

274
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,390
Look at me.

275
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,493
He's gonna be okay.

276
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,245
He'll be back, and you guys
can have a lifetime

277
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,397
of working together,
going to the ballet,

278
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,783
having really awkward
conversations.

279
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,786
[Chuckles, sighs]

280
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,071
Rachel,
I'm gonna say the thing

281
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:43,238
that I know
you don't want to hear.

282
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,840
I don't care
about that right now.

283
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,792
It doesn't have to be
a big deal.

284
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,594
We've all got Louis' back
right now,

285
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,379
and Jessica handles
this stuff anyway.

286
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,682
Just talk to her.

287
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:59,388
You are never allowed
to have a heart attack.

288
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,808
Okay?

289
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,228
Understood.

290
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:14,036
Louis.

291
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,624
Is this heaven?

292
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,877
I can understand
why you would think that,

293
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:22,962
but no.

294
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,247
I don't know
how this can happen.

295
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:29,585
I...Treat my body
like a temple.

296
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:31,887
And you've also been
commuting every weekend,

297
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,035
and you let the associates
raise your blood pressure.

298
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:36,625
- It's because they're stupid.
- Okay, Louis, relax.

299
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:37,727
The doctors say
you're out of danger,

300
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,145
but you shouldn't
get worked up.

301
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,731
- The doctors need to let me go.
- You had a heart attack.

302
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,483
If my blood supply had been
cut off for a half-second less,

303
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,353
it would've been classified
as a minor cardiac event.

304
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:49,138
And what if it would have
lasted half a second more?

305
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,139
It didn't.

306
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,907
And I need to get to work.

307
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:54,243
Louis, I'm serious.
You have to cut back.

308
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,861
You could have died.

309
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:58,247
And if anything
were to happen to you...

310
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:07,707
Harvey would be a total mess.
Okay?

311
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,995
I'll cut back.

312
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,930
Good.

313
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,700
Excuse me.
It's Mike, right?

314
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,235
Yeah. Did you
still need something?

315
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,120
Because I haven't
finished yet.

316
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:28,321
I did. I've been
trying to find Louis.

317
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,572
He wasn't at the meeting.

318
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,708
- Louis isn't here.
- Where is he?

319
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,828
What did you need
to see him about?

320
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,796
I want to talk
about what happened.

321
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:40,216
Yeah, um, look,
I know that we both agreed

322
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,002
that a spin-off
was the better way to go, but--

323
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:44,220
I don't want
to talk about that.

324
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,388
I want to talk about me.

325
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,723
I want out.

326
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,928
You want to leave
Gianopolous

327
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,208
because of what happened
this morning?

328
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,643
What happened this morning
happens every day.

329
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:53,563
He keeps people down
when they reach a certain point,

330
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,515
and I'm pretty sure
I'm at that point.

331
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,900
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.

332
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,384
You don't. No.

333
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,570
In a place like this, your whole
future's laid out for you.

334
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,822
You'll be running
the place before 40.

335
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,574
[Chuckles]

336
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,610
Jonathan, we work
for Tony Gianopolous.

337
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:08,895
And I know I don't
have to tell you,

338
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,330
but you're working
under the same non-compete

339
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:11,781
that William Beck is.

340
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,284
But you work for me too.
Louis is my personal attorney.

341
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,418
I know.

342
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,120
But if there's
a conflict of interest,

343
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,289
we're gonna choose him.

344
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,207
I know
that you have a conflict.

345
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,241
I'm just asking,
is there any way

346
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,077
that you can help me
without...

347
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,079
Helping me?

348
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,015
I'm sorry.

349
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,250
Then where's Louis?

350
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:32,302
Louis is away
on business right now,

351
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,420
so he can't help you either.

352
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:35,939
Then I'll find
someone who will.

353
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,425
Let this serve as formal notice
I'm letting him go.

354
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:42,445
Michigan Court of Appeals.

355
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,814
What?

356
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,449
There was a ruling
a few years ago

357
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,820
that established a weak link
in the non-compete.

358
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,966
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Do you have a minute?

359
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,334
What can I do for you?

360
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,554
The timing on this
is terrible,

361
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,172
and I-I apologize for that.

362
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:11,958
What is it?

363
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,310
I need the first check
for my law school tuition.

364
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,795
Excuse me?

365
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:18,848
Maybe you don't remember, but
when I was wrongfully dismissed,

366
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,466
one of the terms
of my rehiring

367
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,318
was that the firm
pays for my law school.

368
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,154
I remember just fine.

369
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,688
And the only term
of your rehiring

370
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,657
was a 10% increase
in salary.

371
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,476
What?

372
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:34,030
No, I'm--I'm telling you this
was an agreed-upon term, and--

373
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,583
And I'm telling you
I know nothing about that.

374
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,819
And if I had heard about it,
I would have never approved it.

375
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,988
I was scapegoated
by this firm.

376
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,756
And when you agreed
to come back,

377
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,258
you were given a 10% raise.

378
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,426
That's standard.

379
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:48,094
My situation
was not standard.

380
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,264
In what way?

381
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,683
Louis accused me
of being disloyal.

382
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,602
And?

383
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,520
And he turned out
to be wrong.

384
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,855
The problem, Rachel,

385
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:03,560
is that you have no record
of what you're saying.

386
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,278
He agreed to it.

387
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:07,680
He is your agent.

388
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,699
You're bound by this.

389
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,117
I don't know that.

390
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,785
And the man just had
a heart attack.

391
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:15,371
And I'm not going
to call him and ask him.

392
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,073
I know that,
and I don't want you to.

393
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:19,909
Then this conversation
is over.

394
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,839
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

395
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,724
Dr. Iverson
to the cardiac lab.

396
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,476
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sheila.

397
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:38,211
I'm so sorry.
You should be.

398
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,378
I don't know
why I had a heart attack,

399
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,980
but I promise
it won't happen again.

400
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:44,884
You think I'm mad
because you had a heart attack?

401
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,615
It's a sign of weakness.
You hate weakness.

402
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,008
No, I hate
that you're doing work.

403
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,439
- Sheila--
- No, Louis,

404
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,658
do you know what I was thinking
about the whole way down here?

405
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,893
I was thinking
that if you died,

406
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,728
I'd want to die too.

407
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,996
So you better start
taking care of yourself,

408
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,164
because I don't want to--

409
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:00,416
- Sheila--
- No. No more work.

410
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,567
Okay, but this isn't
what you think it is.

411
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:02,952
Don't fight me
on this, please.

412
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:04,420
- Okay, but I need that--
- Don't fight me on this!

413
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,574
"Sheila, as long
as I've known you, I've had a...

414
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:10,576
"I've had a feeling
of completeness.

415
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,178
[Sighs]

416
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:15,515
Romeo and Juliet.
Antony and Cleopatra."

417
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,467
You crossed out
Jaime and Cersei Lannister.

418
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,392
I thought they were
too controversial a couple.

419
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,638
- Too controversial for what?
- A proposal.

420
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,357
What?

421
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:25,942
Sheila, I could've died.

422
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,945
And I don't want my life
to have ended without--

423
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,096
Louis, I don't want you to ask
me what you're about to ask me

424
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:31,597
because you're afraid
to die alone.

425
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,599
No.

426
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,618
It's not about that.

427
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:43,076
It's not about dying alone.

428
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,962
It's about living
without the woman I love.

429
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,052
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

430
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,339
you are the love
of what I hope will be

431
00:16:56,423 --> 00:17:00,176
my very, very long life.

432
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:03,629
And I can't spend one more
second of it without you.

433
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,519
Will you marry me?

434
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,138
Yes.

435
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,358
Yes, I'll marry you.

436
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,487
Tony,
what can I do for you?

437
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:30,590
You screwed me over.

438
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,325
By figuring out how to fire
the guy you told us to fire?

439
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:35,494
By telling my number two
how to break his non-compete.

440
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,666
- I did nothing of the kind.
- Then it was Louis Litt.

441
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:40,550
No way.
That did not happen.

442
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:42,302
That's bullshit, Harvey,
we had a meeting.

443
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,170
Jonathan stuck around
for the paperwork.

444
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:46,773
Then suddenly he comes back
with his resignation

445
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,608
and some Michigan
Appeals Court precedent

446
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:50,009
for breaking our deal.

447
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,194
Well, he couldn't have
met with Louis

448
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,528
because Louis wasn't even
in the office.

449
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,863
Then it was someone else.

450
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,147
Tony, what exactly
do you want?

451
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,733
You want me to fire him
like we're firing Beck?

452
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,701
I'll tell you
a little secret.

453
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,454
I don't give a shit
whether Beck goes or not.

454
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:03,706
But can you understand
why I want him crushed?

455
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,575
Because you want
people like Jonathan Sidwell

456
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,460
to know what happens
when they try to leave.

457
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:08,461
Ah.

458
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,529
Finally my lawyer shows up.

459
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:13,716
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

460
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,718
You see it
how you want to see it.

461
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,087
But if you can't figure out
a way to make Jonathan stay,

462
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:21,007
you'll be the one who's gone.

463
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,425
Tony.

464
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:26,312
I'm gonna fix this,
but let's get one thing clear.

465
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,181
I'm not like the other lawyers
you've burned through.

466
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,183
So the next time
you go stomping around

467
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,069
like a four-year-old
throwing tantrums with me,

468
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,356
I'll be the one
getting rid of you.

469
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,380
 I guess you were
never really onboard after all.

470
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,905
What?
I did the paperwork for Beck.

471
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,070
I'm not talking about Beck.

472
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,607
I'm talking
about Jonathan Sidwell.

473
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,659
Michigan Court of Appeals
sound familiar?

474
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,611
[Sighs]

475
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,229
Harvey,
he was gonna fire Louis.

476
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:58,398
If that's the advice
he was looking for from Louis,

477
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,733
he'd have fired him anyway.

478
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,085
And Jonathan would've
found that loophole anyway.

479
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:02,536
But instead
he got it from you.

480
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,587
What do you want from me?
Louis had a heart attack.

481
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:07,124
Jessica told us not to--
don't hide behind that shit.

482
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,509
Let's get
into what this is really about.

483
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,076
What the hell
are you talking about?

484
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:11,595
I'm talking about
your conversation with Jessica.

485
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,247
So that's why you were
telling me my idea was so good

486
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,768
after our Gianopolous meeting.

487
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,219
Yeah.
We had that conversation.

488
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,687
And yeah, it sucks.

489
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,689
But this has nothing
to do with that.

490
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:23,924
- Then prove it.
- Prove what?

491
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,526
He's unhappy
with his situation.

492
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,260
When people are unhappy,
they find a way out.

493
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,645
Which brings me
back to my point.

494
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,481
You weren't really on board.

495
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,616
I told you,
I took care of Beck.

496
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,984
Well, now you're gonna
do the same for Jonathan.

497
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:35,769
The Michigan ruling
clearly states that he has--

498
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,121
Don't quote precedent to me.

499
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,456
You figured out how he could
break the non-compete,

500
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,158
now figure out
how to enforce it.

501
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:42,626
- Harvey--
- Enough.

502
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,877
You're a pretty good lawyer
when you want to be,

503
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:46,997
so maybe try doing it
for our side this time.

504
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:56,840
Bad night?

505
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,143
Only if you call
figuring out a way

506
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:01,645
to crush
someone's hopes and dreams bad.

507
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,129
What about you?

508
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,567
You, uh, take care
of that awkward conversation?

509
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:11,438
Yeah, it wasn't awkward.
It was...

510
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,575
Humiliating.

511
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:16,193
Louis never
actually told Jessica.

512
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,745
What?
That's bullshit.

513
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:21,081
He made a promise to you.
He's an agent of the firm.

514
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,449
You know,
I never thought about that.

515
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,001
Maybe I should just
rush to his hospital bed

516
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:26,036
and get him to admit
that he screwed me over.

517
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,705
[Sighs]

518
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,208
How could he
lie to me like that?

519
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,093
Rachel, why he lied
to you doesn't matter.

520
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,829
- It matters to me.
- Well, you said it yourself.

521
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,598
Do you really want
to upset him just to find out?

522
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:38,632
Of course not.

523
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,100
Then take the emotion
out of it.

524
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:43,270
- What are you talking about?
- It's a contract problem.

525
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:46,056
Figure out a way
to enforce the contract.

526
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,014
I have someone
here to see you.

527
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,234
Donna, I don't have time
to see anyone right--

528
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:59,238
oh, look who it is.
Where the hell have you been?

529
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:01,455
Harvey, don't be a dick.
He had a heart attack.

530
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:03,356
And you think
having a heart attack

531
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,243
gives you the right
to take the day off?

532
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:12,216
I'm alive.
[Chuckles]

533
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,218
[Quietly]
Help me.

534
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:16,553
[Quietly]
Hug him back.

535
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:22,676
I'm gonna let you two
be alone.

536
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:26,597
Okay, not that I'm not
enjoying this, but...

537
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,881
Shouldn't you be home?

538
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:30,383
No, the doctor cleared me
to come back.

539
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,852
Sheila's allowing me
half days.

540
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:34,071
The other half of the day...

541
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,572
I'm at home
planning my wedding.

542
00:21:35,657 --> 00:21:37,057
You're engaged?

543
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,942
It's the happiest moment
of my life.

544
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,061
I'll send my condolences
to the bride-to-be.

545
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:42,529
That kind of sense of humor

546
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,780
is exactly what I want
of my best man.

547
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,505
Louis, are you asking me
to be your best--

548
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:48,068
Harvey, before you answer,

549
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,570
I am sorry my fight with Scottie
put you in a bad situation.

550
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:52,756
And I know calling in
my chit with you

551
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,161
jeopardized our friendship,
but...

552
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,575
- Louis--
- Let me just finish.

553
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:58,679
You said I can't
have it both ways, but--

554
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:00,847
I'd be honored.

555
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,918
Thank you, Harvey.

556
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,137
You're welcome, Louis.

557
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,282
- Mr. Kovacs.
- Yes?

558
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,867
Mike Ross.
Pearson Specter.

559
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,202
Do we have business
together?

560
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:23,787
Jonathan Sidwell.

561
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:25,192
I understand
you made him an offer

562
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,707
to run
your investment division.

563
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:29,876
Jonathan reached out to me
with a proposal, and I liked it.

564
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:30,877
Did he happen
to mention the fact

565
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:31,878
that he's under a non-compete?

566
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:32,946
Yes.

567
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,214
He also mentioned that

568
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:35,761
the Michigan Court
of Appeals decision

569
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,283
makes his contract breakable.

570
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,469
I had my lawyers look into it.
He's right.

571
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:40,787
Did you also have
your lawyers

572
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:42,789
look into the theft
of intellectual property?

573
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,974
What are you talking about?

574
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,458
I'm talking
about the algorithm

575
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,727
that Jonathan developed
to identify

576
00:22:46,794 --> 00:22:48,145
companies ripe for takeover.

577
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:50,397
- My employee, my algorithm.
- Wrong.

578
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,516
Jonathan developed it
while under contract

579
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,137
with Tony Gianopolous,
which makes it his property.

580
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,856
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

581
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:00,974
I just came down here

582
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:02,326
to let you know
you can go ahead

583
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,694
and do whatever you care to
with Jonathan Sidwell,

584
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:05,912
but if you use
his algorithm,

585
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,866
we're gonna sue you for
every penny that comes from it.

586
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,343
- Hi.
- Hi.

587
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:20,660
I heard you were back.

588
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,662
Should you be doing that?
Prescribed.

589
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:25,382
Light walking.
Need to get the blood flowing.

590
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:27,217
Okay.

591
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,102
Good.

592
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,771
Look, Louis, I am--

593
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:32,723
I'm sorry about what happened.
I really am.

594
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:34,891
Well, I'm gonna
be fine, Rachel.

595
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,226
Good.

596
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,029
I actually wanted to talk to you
about a contracts issue.

597
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,848
- Shoot.
- Okay.

598
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,779
A friend of mine
entered into a verbal agreement

599
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:47,020
with an agent for a corporation,
and now he's reneging on it.

600
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,405
Wait a second, why verbal?

601
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:49,740
Why not?

602
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,241
Verbal contracts are binding,
and she knows it.

603
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:53,293
She have it on tape?
No.

604
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,862
Well, then he can lie about
it, or he can argue the wording.

605
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,581
No, he made a clear promise.

606
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,532
Well, maybe it was
a promise to try,

607
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:02,719
or maybe it was a suggestion.
No, it wasn't.

608
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,139
What's the contract?

609
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,891
Employment bonus.

610
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,476
Lump sum
or payable over time?

611
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,544
- Three-year term.
- Well, then verbal ain't shit.

612
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:15,065
If it's paid over a year
or more, it has to be written.

613
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,900
My friend made life decisions
based on this promise.

614
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:19,052
She could sue
for promissory estoppel.

615
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:20,053
Well, she could sue
the dick who made the deal,

616
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:21,438
but she can't sue the company.

617
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,607
- She doesn't want to do that.
- Let me ask you this.

618
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,410
Why wouldn't she get it
in writing if it was legit?

619
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:29,062
Because she trusted him.

620
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,164
She doesn't know
why he would lie to her.

621
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,783
He did because he could.

622
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,085
He wanted what he wanted
when he wanted it,

623
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,337
and it cost him nothing.

624
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:38,839
You know?
Yeah.

625
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:41,675
Maybe she should go after him.
She could try.

626
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:42,876
But I mean, realistically,
she'll lose, and she should,

627
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:45,429
because stupidity
shouldn't be rewarded.

628
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,581
So glad you came to see me.
You really got my juices going.

629
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:49,599
Make me feel glad to be back.

630
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,802

00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:59,776
- This is nice, fiance.
- It is nice, betrothed.

632
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,095
So where should we do it?

633
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:04,948
Sheila, are you serious?
I just had a heart attack.

634
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,534
I'm talking
about the wedding.

635
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,369
I say we do it here.

636
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,955
Get married in New York?

637
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,574
It's where
our relationship began.

638
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,878
I think it's only fitting
that we tie the knot here.

639
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,330
I love you.

640
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:22,582
Good, then it's decided.

641
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:23,950
We'll do it here

642
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,719
and then move
straight to Boston.

643
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:27,170
What do you mean
move to Boston?

644
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:28,638
I'm not moving to Boston.

645
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,558
You have to. You know
what Harvard means to me.

646
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,977
You know what
Pearson Specter means to me.

647
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,312
Okay, Louis,
there are a dozen firms

648
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:36,997
that would snap you up
in a second there.

649
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,464
Same goes
for law schools here.

650
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:41,134
Yeah,
but they're not Harvard,

651
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:44,988
which means
they're second tier.

652
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:47,324
You seriously expected me
to drop everything

653
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:48,575
and move to New York?

654
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,410
Yeah, I did.

655
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:52,496
Okay, well, I think
that's a little presumptuous.

656
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,497
Me?

657
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,981
What about you?

658
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:56,867
You're the one who has us
buying a place on Bacon Hill.

659
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:00,036
Okay, it's "Beacon Hill,"
and I thought you liked it.

660
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,123
To visit.
I mean, not to live.

661
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:04,791
And what are you talking about,
our law schools are second tier?

662
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:05,876
Your city is second tier.

663
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,328
Well, maybe my city
is second tier.

664
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:11,848
But it's also the home of
the woman you supposedly love.

665
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:14,801
Oh, Sheila,
come on, please.

666
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,520
I mean, everything I have
is in New York.

667
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:20,106
Everything except me.

668
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:33,661
It's usually easier
if you look at the screen.

669
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,496
With your eyes.

670
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:37,948
I'm...I'm sorry.

671
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:42,002
It's just been
one of those weeks.

672
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,171
You know Louis
is gonna be okay, right?

673
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:48,008
Yeah, I know
he's going to be okay.

674
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,628
But at the moment,
I hate his guts.

675
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:02,256
I hear congratulations
are in order.

676
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:04,859
Jessica.

677
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:09,063
Another eligible bachelor
bites the dust.

678
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,615
Yeah.
I mean, no, it's--

679
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,867
[chuckles]
It's amazing.

680
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:14,318
How are you feeling?

681
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,821
Better, thanks.

682
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:21,275
I wanted to get you
a little welcome-back something.

683
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:23,828
It's not much.

684
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:29,667
You know, you gave me
quite a scare this week.

685
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,468
I love it.

686
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:33,671
The Pearson Hardman retreat
five years ago.

687
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:37,124
And do you know what I
remember most about that night?

688
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,560
What an amazing dancer
you are.

689
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:40,928
Five years,
Long Island School of Ballet.

690
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:43,797
[Laughs] You weren't
dancing ballet that night.

691
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,633
Well, they say ballet is
the foundation for everything.

692
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:50,187
Well, sir, you have
an amazing foundation.

693
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:53,574
I just thought you could
add that to your collection.

694
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:57,411
Somewhere between you and...
Bruno.

695
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:06,670
It means so much to me
that you...

696
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,456
Louis.

697
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:12,326
Come on.

698
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:15,495
After everything
we've been through...

699
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:19,166
You're family.

700
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,524
- Holy shit.
- I know.

701
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,277
He betrayed me.
Maybe, but, Rachel,

702
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,897
you didn't even give him
a chance to explain himself.

703
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:34,531
I didn't want to upset him.

704
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:37,201
Even if he was
bullshitting you back then,

705
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:40,120
the Louis I know
is a man of his word.

706
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:41,906
And if you went to him
honestly--

707
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,490
It wouldn't matter.

708
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,691
He would just say
he agreed to it,

709
00:28:44,743 --> 00:28:46,126
and Jessica
would still say no.

710
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,861
He might offer to pay.

711
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:50,030
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't let him.

712
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:51,465
And you know what,
that's not the problem.

713
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:52,750
What is the problem?

714
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,155
The problem is
he made me a chump.

715
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,136
- Rachel--
- Donna, I went in there

716
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:59,373
as a paralegal trying
to negotiate with Louis Litt,

717
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:02,393
and I left with the money
to become a lawyer,

718
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:03,644
and for the first time
in my life,

719
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:05,896
I felt like
I could actually be one.

720
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:09,683
And now I realize that...
[Chuckles]

721
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,435
When I left that room,

722
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,738
he was probably laughing about
how he pulled one over on me.

723
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:16,273
Maybe you're right.

724
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:19,159
But I'm telling you, the Louis
of today would never do that.

725
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,528
Well, the Rachel of today
certainly wouldn't

726
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:22,896
let him get away with it.

727
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:25,916
And the Donna of today
is a genius.

728
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,901
Well, the genius of Donna
is every day.

729
00:29:27,953 --> 00:29:30,838
[Laughs]
What are you saying?

730
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,589
Just because
you can't go after Louis

731
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:37,428
doesn't mean you can't
still make your case.

732
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:40,798
What the hell
is wrong with you?

733
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:42,132
You gave me the map to escape

734
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:43,384
and told the guards
where I'd be.

735
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:45,102
- Jonathan--
- Kovacs rescinded his offer.

736
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:46,920
He said I'm not worth it
without that algorithm.

737
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:49,523
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

738
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,608
You gave me that advice
in the first place.

739
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,173
Because you threatened
to leave Louis.

740
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:54,528
Bullshit.

741
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,980
You did it because you knew
what I was up against,

742
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,398
and you were
trying to help me.

743
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:58,699
Whether that's true or not,

744
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,200
that advice was
off the record,

745
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:03,320
and it turns out that on the
record it's my job to stop you.

746
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:05,322
Well, congratulations.

747
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:07,491
You ripped away
the thing I value the most.

748
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,793
That algorithm--it took me
ten years to develop it.

749
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:11,495
It's how I look
at valuing companies.

750
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,546
It's how I look at the world.

751
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:15,332
If I can't take it with me,

752
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,834
even if someone thinks
I'm worth something, I'm not.

753
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:18,785
- Jonathan--
- Please.

754
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:20,471
You did your job
on the record.

755
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:24,475
Now off the record,
what do I do?

756
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,127
It was my job to make sure
there's nothing you could do.

757
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:30,564
Then check in with me
in ten years.

758
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,149
'Cause I promise you
I'll be at the same desk

759
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,134
punching the same clock.

760
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:35,903
Can't move up,
can't move out.

761
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,523
It's on you.

762
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:54,154
You were right.

763
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:58,876
This isn't about William Beck
or Jonathan Sidwell.

764
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,377
It's about me.

765
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:02,346
- Mike--
- I want to go legit.

766
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,264
- You can't.
- Harvey, listen--

767
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,799
Do I need to state
the obvious?

768
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,168
I can go to law school now,
all right? Get a real degree.

769
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:09,436
Even if it didn't matter

770
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:10,687
that you've already
presented yourself

771
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:11,972
as having gone to Harvard law,

772
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,340
you'd have to take
the bar again.

773
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:14,691
Okay, I passed it once,
I'll pass it again.

774
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:15,943
Not under your own name.

775
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,311
And if you take it now,

776
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:19,346
you'll draw attention
to yourself in a major way.

777
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,115
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

778
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,233
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

779
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:24,401
Are you insane?

780
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:26,153
Hacking into the bar
is twice the crime

781
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,354
you've been committing.

782
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:28,455
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

783
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,873
you don't move
the goddamn body.

784
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,358
You do if they're
about to find it.

785
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:32,530
They're not
about to find it.

786
00:31:32,577 --> 00:31:34,578
They're always
about to find it!

787
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:38,248
Mike, committing another fraud
to cover your fraud

788
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,699
isn't going legit.

789
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:41,919
It's just covering your ass,
and it doesn't undo

790
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,703
the fact that you've already
committed the crime.

791
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,974
You think I haven't thought
about all of this?

792
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,595
Harvey, I'm stuck.

793
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,149
There's no way up,
there's no way down.

794
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:57,601
[Chuckles]

795
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:01,388
I can't live
my whole life like this.

796
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,563
Okay.

797
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:12,249
You want to be legit,

798
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,750
there's only one way.

799
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:16,370
You go to a small town
in Iowa

800
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,589
where nobody's ever heard
of Harvey Specter,

801
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,424
Jessica Pearson,
or anybody else,

802
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:24,044
you go to law school,
hang out your shingle.

803
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,547
Nobody will ever know.

804
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:28,515
I guarantee you'd be
king of the hill.

805
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:32,085
But you could never
come back to the mountain.

806
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:35,722
Not here in New York,
Chicago, or L.A.

807
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,442
Someone'll know someone,

808
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,478
and it'll all be for nothing.

809
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:45,098
I can't do that,
and you know it.

810
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,783
I do know it.

811
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:50,154
Mike, you're in
the major leagues,

812
00:32:50,238 --> 00:32:52,939
and you get to go toe-to-toe
with the best there is.

813
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:56,793
And I can't tell you
if that's enough for a lifetime,

814
00:32:56,878 --> 00:33:00,214
but if you want to stay,
there's nothing more you can do.

815
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:03,884
My advice is hold on tight
and enjoy the ride.

816
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,565
What are you doing here?

817
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:18,933
I'm here to help you.

818
00:33:18,984 --> 00:33:20,851
You said there was no way
to stop what you did.

819
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:24,105
This isn't a legal solution.
It's a business solution.

820
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,991
One where everybody wins.
Everybody wins?

821
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,242
That's what you said
about Beck.

822
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,660
So you want me
to spin off my own company,

823
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:30,661
I run it, he owns it?

824
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:33,313
I never said that.

825
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:34,865
Well, he didn't
go for it with Beck.

826
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,751
Why would he go for it
with me?

827
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:40,871
Because he doesn't give
a shit about William Beck.

828
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:43,958
What are you saying?

829
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,843
You develop your algorithm
every day.

830
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:46,844
Of course.

831
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:47,995
It's useless if I don't.

832
00:33:48,046 --> 00:33:49,180
Right, but that's not
why you do it.

833
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:50,264
You do it because you love it.

834
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,849
Well, he can
force me to stay,

835
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,601
but he can't force me
to love it.

836
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,002
And that's exactly
where your leverage is.

837
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:58,773
If you don't love what you do,
it costs him a fortune.

838
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,724
And he knows it.

839
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,693
This isn't a sure thing.

840
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:03,778
Which is why
I'm trusting he won't know

841
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:05,563
it came from me
if it doesn't work.

842
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,899
Why are you doing this?

843
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:13,320
Let's just say
I love my job...

844
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:16,356
but I know what it feels like
to be trapped.

845
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,498
Donna said
you wanted to see me

846
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:26,801
about some more
managerial bullshit.

847
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:28,202
What?

848
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,087
Don't you think I learned
my lesson with the checks?

849
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:33,707
- Then why am I here?
- You're here to listen to me.

850
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:36,310
Do you know
what this is about?

851
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:38,545
Yes.
And I already told you--

852
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:41,348
I am not here to ask you
to honor Louis' contract.

853
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,768
I am here to ask you
to make a new one with me.

854
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:45,986
Our contract with you

855
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:47,321
is a promise of a job
when you get out,

856
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:49,523
not paying for you
on your way in.

857
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:51,408
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

858
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:54,945
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

859
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,397
Give me an advance on mine.

860
00:34:57,449 --> 00:34:59,416
The last time we negotiated,
you said,

861
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,086
"never sign something without
getting something in return."

862
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,038
What you're getting
in return

863
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:06,624
is that I keep working here
part-time.

864
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:10,077
The advance, plus my salary,
will cover my tuition.

865
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:12,546
Paralegals
don't make that much.

866
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:13,931
Those numbers don't add up.

867
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:15,799
I'm not proposing
being a paralegal.

868
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,219
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

869
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,586
and I can do the same.

870
00:35:19,638 --> 00:35:22,589
You came up with that
pretty fast.

871
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,191
It's almost
as if you wanted me

872
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:25,943
to ask you
what I get in return.

873
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:28,479
- Do we have a deal?
- One problem.

874
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:31,565
You already asked me
to break precedent once

875
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:34,201
when I waived
the Harvard rule.

876
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,603
I'm not breaking it again
to pay for law school.

877
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:39,123
I'm not asking you
to break anything.

878
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:43,827
You already established
precedence, with him.

879
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:46,914
When you paid
for his law school.

880
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,615
That is not
common knowledge.

881
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,135
No, it's not.

882
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,003
That's why
she wanted me here.

883
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,889
I'm exhibit A.

884
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,090
You made an investment
in Harvey,

885
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,642
and I think
that turned out pretty well.

886
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,061
I could argue that point.

887
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,648
No, Rachel's right.
I'm pretty awesome.

888
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,466
I assume you have this
in writing.

889
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:08,402
I wouldn't be worth it
if I didn't.

890
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:11,655
Let me guess.
He went for it.

891
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,308
He did.

892
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,114
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

893
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:22,983
I want you to join
my new corporation.

894
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:26,170
It's an offer letter.

895
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:27,621
I don't understand.

896
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,290
You said you know
what it's like to feel trapped.

897
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:30,958
Thought maybe
you'd like a way out.

898
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,327
- I also said I love what I do.
- Maybe.

899
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:36,496
But let me tell you
what I once told Louis Litt.

900
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:39,883
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

901
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,885
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

902
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,723
Wait a second.

903
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:48,108
You're not asking me to be
your in-house counsel.

904
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:49,860
You kidding me?

905
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:52,279
Most people don't even know
what an algorithm is.

906
00:36:52,347 --> 00:36:56,233
You used it to strong-arm me
and Tony Gianopolous.

907
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:58,068
You have a mind for this.

908
00:36:58,153 --> 00:36:59,820
Jonathan...

909
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:03,207
You don't have
to answer right now.

910
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,959
Just think about this.

911
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:09,163
You're in
the minor leagues here.

912
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:13,384
I'm giving you a chance
to play in the majors.

913
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,772
I'm glad you came.

914
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:37,891
I hope you don't mind.

915
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,661
I thought you might like it.

916
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:43,664
[Both chuckle]

917
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:46,066
- Sheila...
- It's just a gesture.

918
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:48,068
It's a beautiful gesture.

919
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,337
You're so...

920
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:52,572
You're everything.

921
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,758
Oh, no,
is this where you tell me

922
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:59,380
that you're not gonna
move to Boston?

923
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,965
Not everybody sees me
the way you do.

924
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,420
Most people take a very,
very long time to figure me out.

925
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:10,357
It's taken me years and years
to get the people here to see

926
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:14,194
past my short temper
and my...

927
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:16,030
Weird obsessions.

928
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,698
Your love of mudding
is not weird.

929
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:21,118
Well, you see, I know that.

930
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:24,154
You know who else knows that?

931
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,272
Donna,

932
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:28,659
Jessica, Mike, Rachel,
and Harvey.

933
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:32,612
They appreciate me.

934
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:33,797
They're my family.

935
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:35,632
I'm asking you...

936
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:38,302
Please don't make me
leave my family.

937
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:43,623
I'll move to New York.

938
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,730
Yeah.

939
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,733
- You won't regret this.
- I know I won't.

940
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,135
I promise I'm gonna
give you the best life.

941
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:57,104
We're gonna be
a New York power couple.

942
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:58,638
Law by day,
love by night.

943
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,741
And when we have kids,
world, watch out.

944
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:04,027
Sazs-Litts,
they're gonna be ridiculous.

945
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,329
Wait, what?

946
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,414
I mean, let's face it.
Our kids?

947
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:09,983
They hit the genetic lottery.

948
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:12,286
Louis, I don't want kids.

949
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:14,338
What?

950
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:16,256
They don't get me.

951
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:19,493
What? I mean, what--
what are you talking about?

952
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:21,178
I don't like kids.

953
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:24,631
I like when they're 22
and going to law school,

954
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:25,716
but I just...

955
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,801
Those would be adults.

956
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:31,105
Exactly.

957
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,891
No, no, no.

958
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:38,946
You may think that now,
but when it actually happens,

959
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:42,282
when--when they're yours,
it's so--

960
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,852
Louis, I'm never
gonna think that, ever.

961
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:50,857
- How can you--
- How can I what?

962
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,410
It's who I am.

963
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:58,215
Sheila,
I'm gonna be a father.

964
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,367
Louis, we're so happy.

965
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:02,702
We can be happy.

966
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:04,871
Just us.

967
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:12,146
I was willing to give up
Harvard for you.

968
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:17,985
You can't give up
something for me?
