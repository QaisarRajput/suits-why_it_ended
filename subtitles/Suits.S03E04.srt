00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,799
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

3
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:04,935
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

4
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:06,909
If you're looking to ride
some partner's coattails,

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,022
you're gonna have to
look somewhere else.

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,557
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

7
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:13,894
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

8
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,229
I know about your deal
with Edward.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,147
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

10
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,283
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video.

11
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:20,634
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

12
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:23,170
You told me
to take this deal.

13
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,988
I did,
and now here I am.

14
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:26,623
I didn't know
about these murders.

15
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,959
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

16
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:30,920
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

17
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,538
Mike Ross is.

18
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:33,905
And I can't take it back.

19
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:35,708
Your future at this firm
is over.

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,560
This is everything I have
on Tony Gianopolous.

21
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,295
Welcome to team Litt.

22
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,798
We just admitted to each other
that we're defending a murderer.

23
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:44,967
It doesn't really seem
like cause for celebration.

24
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:46,118
It's not a celebration.

25
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:47,253
I made a deal with Darby

26
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,021
to take over the firm
from Jessica.

27
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,797
- You heard?
- I heard.

28
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:34,016
- Vote's in 48 hours.
- She's not losing that vote.

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,819
- I'm getting my shit.
- I got my shit.

30
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,520
- Conference room.
- Five minutes.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,610
What is she doing here?

32
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,111
She's my new associate.

33
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:47,646
So that's why you made
the video.

34
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:49,337
You seem upset
that she led you to believe

35
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,616
that she was trying
to befriend you

36
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,167
when it turned out
she was gonna betray you.

37
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:54,086
- Louis.
- You got a problem with that?

38
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,487
No.
No problem.

39
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:56,922
Not as long
as your daddy's here.

40
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,457
Do I have to have
another talk with you?

41
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,359
- He had a talk with you?
- Yes.

42
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:02,428
But I didn't feel the need
to run to you to protect me.

43
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:03,712
Second choice never does.

44
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:04,847
I can't believe it's up to me

45
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,931
to be the adult in the room.

46
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:08,183
Maybe it's time
we get down to business.

47
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:09,968
Good, because the first order
of business

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,471
is discussing what to do
following Ava's statement.

49
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,682
She's not making a statement.

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,307
- Yes, she is.
- Ava makes a statement,

51
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,508
Cameron's gonna be all over it.

52
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,176
Cameron Dennis
isn't the problem right now.

53
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,696
The problem is Ava Hessington
isn't a credible CEO.

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,449
The problem is she's on trial
for murder.

55
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,234
And public perception
says that she's as guilty

56
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:27,278
as Jean Valjean with a loaf
of bread in his pants.

57
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:31,407
We're facing a vote for control
of her company in two days.

58
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,575
Talking under threat
makes her look desperate.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,128
And not talking makes her look
either guilty or incompetent.

60
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:37,863
We need to send the message
to Wall Street

61
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,998
that she's in control
and she's got nothing to hide.

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,167
This is a meeting
about how to keep Ava's company

63
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,420
without endangering
her murder defense.

64
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:45,888
Did it ever occur to you that,
if she's cold enough

65
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,539
to kill off opposition
to her pipeline,

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,008
she's cold enough to pull off
lying to the press?

67
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,378
I mean, we all know
she did this, right?

68
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,318
This isn't open
for discussion.

69
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:00,753
She's not saying a word.

70
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,237
I'm afraid it's too late.

71
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,073
What did you do?

72
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:05,407
She's on her way
to an interview right now.

73
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:06,525
It'll run in the <i>Journal,</i>

74
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,910
and then it will blow
Gianopolous

75
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:10,662
and his bullshit takeover
attempt out of the water.

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,617
[Cell phone ringing]

77
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:17,870
- Connelly.
- Mr. Connelly, I do apologize,

78
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,122
but I'm afraid we have to change
the location of our interview.

79
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,474
- Who is this?
- Miss Hessington's assistant.

80
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,676
Well, I spoke to her assistant
this morning--

81
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:27,262
Yes, Rebecca handles
Miss Hessington's schedule.

82
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,014
I handle her life.

83
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,966
What, so I'm supposed
to traipse all over town

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,050
because of what she'd prefer?

85
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,520
- Not prefer. Insist.
- Insist?

86
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:36,688
I'm giving her a forum
to tell her side of the story.

87
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,358
An exclusive forum
which needn't be the case.

88
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,943
Now make no mistake,
Mr. Connelly,

89
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:42,978
Miss Hessington is the one
doing the favor here.

90
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,596
So, if you'd like
to speak with her,

91
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:47,316
my driver will be more
than happy to take you to her.

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,736
Or if you would prefer
to call Rebecca,

93
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,404
I'm sure she'll be able
to set something up for you

94
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:55,941
sometime say next December.

95
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,473
Go ahead and order.

96
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,291
Connelly's
running a little late.

97
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,593
He should get here

98
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,628
at ten past "you're not giving
an interview."

99
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,313
I wasn't trying
to keep this from you.

100
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,649
You didn't exactly cc me
on the memo.

101
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,485
Very well.
You want the truth?

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,905
I don't particularly appreciate
being muzzled.

103
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,774
I suggest you don't think
of it as muzzled so much

104
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,026
as keeping you out of jail
for the rest of your life.

105
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,028
And what'll you have me do,
Harvey, hmm?

106
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:35,330
Take a week in St. Barts?

107
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,648
Because that is not going
to happen.

108
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,083
I know that's not going
to happen.

109
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,501
You're on trial for murder.

110
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,670
And because of that
a tender offer's being made

111
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:44,373
on a company
with my family name.

112
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:46,925
And with all that going on,
the fact that I haven't made

113
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:49,127
a statement defending myself
is bullshit.

114
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,712
It's not bullshit.
It's smart.

115
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,514
Of course you see it that way.

116
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,433
You think I'm guilty.

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,468
I've told you before
it doesn't matter what I think.

118
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,937
But if you think saying you're
innocent is gonna make people

119
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,505
believe you, it won't.

120
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,774
Because you know who says
they're innocent?

121
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:04,009
Everybody.

122
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,528
Every day
I keep my mouth shut

123
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,447
our stock takes a dive,

124
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,365
and that makes me vulnerable.

125
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,366
I get it.

126
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,651
You want to convince the world

127
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,119
you're not responsible
for these murders

128
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,787
so you can keep control
of your big oil company.

129
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:17,372
That is not what I said.

130
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:19,958
Well, that's how Cameron
Dennis is gonna make it sound.

131
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:23,328
Ava, you're on trial
for your life.

132
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,963
This company is my life.

133
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,165
And that's exactly
what it's gonna look like--

134
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:30,135
a greedy oil exec
clinging to her money factory

135
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:31,803
with her blood-stained hands.

136
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,305
Very well.

137
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:35,724
You've made your point.

138
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:39,895
Now I suggest you find a way
to get me out of both situations

139
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,314
'cause I am not losing control
of my company,

140
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,549

00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:38,044
Um, before anyone sugars
anyone, if you two are dating,

157
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,380
you need to know that we have

158
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:42,316
a very strict policy
in favor of that.

159
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,818
And we have
a very strict policy

160
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,904
to keep our sugar
to ourselves.

161
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:50,324
Oh, that's a pity.

162
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:54,161
I'm partial to a little
sweetness in the morning.

163
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,580
Well, then I would recommend
the bakery on 52nd.

164
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:57,831
You care to join me?

165
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,833
I hate to deny you the pleasure
of my company.

166
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,336
I think I can manage
without it.

167
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,088
Since you're
from a different country,

168
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:07,091
I'll translate: "She finds you
a bit douchey, love."

169
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,259
My loss.

170
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,737
Ladies.

171
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:21,755
Oh, that man is trouble.

172
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:22,856
It's okay.
I can handle it.

173
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,108
Oh, no, it's okay.

174
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,726
I don't need you to.

175
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,145
Wait.
What are we talking about?

176
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,646
The fact
that he's into me.

177
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,365
Were you here?
He's into me.

178
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:33,450
Then why was I the one
getting all the stares?

179
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,570
Haven't you ever heard,
"go after the second prettiest

180
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,821
to get
the prettiest's attention"?

181
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,623
No, I've never heard that.

182
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:41,208
- Well, it's a thing.
- Oh.

183
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,961
Are you saying
I'm the second prettiest?

184
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:48,882
I'm saying you are to him.

185
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,618
Oh, the dress.

186
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,053
- He asked you out?
- Last week.

187
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,171
- And?
- I passed.

188
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,639
- Why?
- Why should I go out with him?

189
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:56,924
Just because he's
charming and hot?

190
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,842
- And witty and British.
- And has a title.

191
00:07:58,927 --> 00:07:59,893
- He does?
- No.

192
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,894
But even if he did,

193
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,095
that wouldn't be a reason.

194
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,627
I told you, Rach,
I don't mix business

195
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,566
- with pleasure.
- Business?

196
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,067
He's only here
for six weeks.

197
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:09,486
And he is based
out of London.

198
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:12,472
It's practically
a different company.

199
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,574
And it's definitely
a different country.

200
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,075
- So you'll consider it?
- Nope.

201
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:17,811
Well

202
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,498
What's going on
with Ava Hessington?

203
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,168
I convinced her
not to give an interview.

204
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,752
How'd she get it in her head
it'd be a good idea

205
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,087
- in the first place?
- Louis.

206
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:28,822
Is he aware
she's up for murder?

207
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,874
Is he aware that most people
don't line their offices

208
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,510
with pictures of themselves?
Evidently not.

209
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,095
You know he's still got one
of his dead cat?

210
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:37,364
Harvey, leave the cat alone.

211
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:39,666
Both: Stupid cat.

212
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,302
How dare
you sabotage my case?

213
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,503
I didn't sabotage shit.

214
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,105
You set that thing up
behind my back

215
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:47,558
and you didn't tell me about it
until you thought it was too late.

216
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,059
Yeah, because I knew
the minute things heated up

217
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:51,144
on the takeover attempt,
you'd want to take my case back.

218
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,863
Take your case back?

219
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,148
I don't know how familiar
you are with the game of law,

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,717
but murder trumps takeover.

221
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:59,403
- You condescending piece of--
- Louis.

222
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,904
Harvey's right.

223
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,289
The woman
can't make public statements

224
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,691
while she's on trial for murder.
Trump.

225
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,192
Well, if she's gonna keep
her mouth shut,

226
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,028
then she's gonna have
to step down

227
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,213
or we're gonna lose this vote.
Asking her to step down

228
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,363
would be asking her
to cut off her arm.

229
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,548
If we don't cut off her arm,
Harvey,

230
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,966
we're gonna lose the patient.

231
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,801
She's my client.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

232
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,169
Ava Hessington
is not my client.

233
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,921
Hessington Oil is.

234
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,674
And they generate $14 million
a year in billables.

235
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:21,975
Have you not been listening?

236
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,061
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

237
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:25,095
Not for long.

238
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,347
- Excuse me?
- Louis is right.

239
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,549
If she steps down now,

240
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,818
we can still win the vote
and keep them as a client.

241
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,386
Well, who's gonna convince her
to do that?

242
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,438
We don't have
to convince her.

243
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,822
We can just go to the board.

244
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,940
We don't even have to tell her.
Like hell you will.

245
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,558
And like hell I won't.

246
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,327
Harvey, this needs to happen.

247
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:43,614
- No, I won't do it.
- This is my call.

248
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:47,334
I'm afraid it isn't.

249
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,569
Excuse me?

250
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,739
You and I both know
who assigned me to this case,

251
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,458
and it wasn't you.

252
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,010
It was the man you chose
to merge with.

253
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,464
The same man who has a 51% share
of our law firm.

254
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,683
So unless
you're gonna undo that,

255
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,587
you're gonna live with this.

256
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,722
Was she pissed?

257
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,307
I bet she was pissed.

258
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:11,441
Not as pissed
as you're gonna be.

259
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,943
What are you talking about?

260
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,362
You're on Katrina duty
for the next two days.

261
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,980
What?
I'd rather be on latrine duty.

262
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,283
- It's not an option.
- Okay, then I'm going AWOL.

263
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,102
Well, let me connect
the dots for you, Forrest Gump.

264
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,454
Even though Jessica gave in
on the strategy,

265
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,990
Louis made it clear he's willing
to sacrifice Ava.

266
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,775
And you don't trust him
to play by the rules.

267
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,611
Which is why you're gonna work
side by side with her

268
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,297
to figure a way out of this jam.

269
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,133
And at the same time make sure
she and Louis don't shaft us.

270
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,551
Not bad, Forrest.

271
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,636
Okay, if I'm Forrest,
then you're Bubba.

272
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,139
- Shrimpin' bidness.
- Harvey...

273
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:43,456
If Ava loses her company,

274
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,509
will Darby still back you
as managing partner?

275
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:48,812
I didn't ask,
but I sure as hell wouldn't.

276
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,636
What is it, Louis?

277
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,406
I just wanted to thank you
for backing me earlier.

278
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:01,474
I had your back because you
had the best strategy.

279
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,859
It still means a lot to me.

280
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,077
And, you know, I don't know
where Harvey gets off

281
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:05,278
telling you how to run things.

282
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,364
It's over, Louis.
I'm moving on.

283
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:10,817
It doesn't have to be.

284
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:13,337
What exactly
are you proposing?

285
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,045
Allow me to be
your black swan.

286
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,431
Let me do the things
that your position precludes you

287
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:28,501
from doing, the dark choices,
the distasteful wet work.

288
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,505
You mean like using lye
to dissolve a human body?

289
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,507
I mean using lies to dislodge
a pesky CEO.

290
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,776
Well, we've been told
that's not an option.

291
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,510
Not for you, maybe,
but as we just agreed,

292
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,346
it's the right option
for the board.

293
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:42,649
And Harvey and his master Lord
Poppycock don't have to know.

294
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,787
Louis, I appreciate
your offer, I do, but--

295
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,656
But the one time
you take my side over his,

296
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,068
you're not willing
to fight for it.

297
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,325
I'm willing to fight.

298
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,827
I just won't do it
behind Darby's back.

299
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,629
Look, I swear
it'll never come back to you.

300
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:59,216
I didn't say I was afraid
to get caught.

301
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,418
I said I don't want
to operate that way.

302
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:02,886
Now if you'll excuse me.

303
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,921
Need I remind you you had me
go behind Harvey's back

304
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,539
to do the same thing
with McKernon Motors?

305
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,041
That was not the same.

306
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,976
I get it.

307
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:12,012
You were in charge then.

308
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:15,065
You're not in charge anymore.

309
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,202
Hey

310
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,523
Ooh, all jammed up?

311
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,443
I'm afraid so.

312
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,911
You just need to coax it
a little.

313
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:32,546
Oh, and how does one
do that?

314
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,131
Oh, it's all in the touch.

315
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:36,666
Well, I've been nothing
but gentle.

316
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:37,751
There's a time to be gentle,

317
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,804
and there's a time
to be firm.

318
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:45,759
You should see
how I handle the fax.

319
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,694
I can imagine.

320
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,202
You know, in fact,
given your skills,

321
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:51,648
I think you'd probably be
the ideal person

322
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,700
to handle my short-term needs.

323
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,986
See, I'm in the states
on a limited basis,

324
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,156
and I've got nobody to help me
with my workload.

325
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,824
I get it.

326
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,943
You're forced
to do everything yourself.

327
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,962
It's getting exhausting.

328
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:10,000
And you need someone
to help relieve the pressure.

329
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,385
Naturally, I thought of you.

330
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,803
Not Rachel?

331
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:14,120
I think you know
the answer to that.

332
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,305
I knew it then.

333
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,391
I know you did.

334
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,293
It'll be a brief,
casual arrangement

335
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:21,511
whilst I'm in New York.

336
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:23,513
I wouldn't have time
for anything more.

337
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,399
Then we have
an agreement?

338
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,634
I don't know.

339
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:29,569
What kind of boss would you be?

340
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:31,438
Demanding.

341
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,690
- But very generous.
- Generous is good.

342
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:37,694
As is Daniel Day-Lewis
doing <i>MacBeth.</i>

343
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,197
You do realize
that this arrangement

344
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:42,032
would involve
no secretarial work?

345
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:45,369
I'd be disappointed
if it did.

346
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,844
- Katrina Bennett.
- At your service.

347
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:56,096
- God, I love the sound of that.
- Your wish is my command.

348
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:58,015
- My wish is for you--
- To work hand in glove

349
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,100
with Mike Ross on getting rid
of Tony Gianopolous,

350
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,852
keep an eye
on what they're doing

351
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,270
while at the same time
limit their understanding

352
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:04,671
- of what we're doing.
- How do you know all that?

353
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:05,922
- It's my job.
- Wait a minute.

354
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,057
I thought you can't stand
Mike Ross.

355
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:08,358
All of a sudden
you're willing to work with him?

356
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,694
- It's my job.
- If I ask you to murder someone

357
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,813
on a rainy winter's eve,
how would you respond?

358
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:15,866
You want a gun or a knife?

359
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,018
If you were less attractive,
I'd love you.

360
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,655
I know.

361
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,691
Louis, why aren't we
just kicking Ava Hessington out?

362
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:26,626
She'd be gone before
she even knew what hit her.

363
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,078
If Harvey had
half your brains,

364
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:29,483
that's exactly
what we'd be doing.

365
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:31,081
But he doesn't,
and as much as I hate

366
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,533
to admit it, he's in charge
of this decision.

367
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,419
He's not in charge
of this firm.

368
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,471
Go to Jessica,
she'll agree with you,

369
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,923
you'll get the credit,
and Harvey will be

370
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,591
off Hessington Oil before
he even knows what hit him.

371
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:45,062
Katrina, as much
as I appreciate your suggestion,

372
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,314
I refuse to operate
in a duplicitous manner.

373
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,104
Then I'll find us a way to get
rid of Tony Gianopolous anyway.

374
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,076
Ahahah-ah.

375
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,727
I might have to let you look
at what I've got,

376
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,446
but I don't have
to let you touch it.

377
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,564
Touch it?

378
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,083
This room is a disaster.

379
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,035
This room is fine.

380
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:12,072
I know where everything is
and what everything is.

381
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,426
What are you even doing?

382
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,794
Finding dirt on Gianopolous.

383
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,262
You're dealing with one

384
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:20,797
of the most sophisticated
raiders in the world.

385
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,562
He's not leaving a trail
for you to follow.

386
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,584
Oh, yeah?
And what's your strategy?

387
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:27,253
You gonna record him and make
an embarrassing video?

388
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:30,190
No.
Gonna play a little game.

389
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:33,310
Monopoly?

390
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,444
You don't think
I started with that?

391
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,979
There's no way to have
a monopoly

392
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:38,065
in the oil business.
It's too goddamn big.

393
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:39,699
And even if you could,
these are all the companies

394
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,618
that Gianopolous owns
in any way,

395
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:44,104
and these are the biggest
companies in the oil industry.

396
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,290
There's no way
to connect the dots.

397
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,460
Well, do you want to go
down the same road and have

398
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,278
another fight or do you want
to try to figure out a way--

399
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,614
- Shit.
- What?

400
00:15:57,085 --> 00:16:00,220
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

401
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,179
Shit.

402
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,066
Shit.

403
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:20,640
Shitty shit.

404
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:23,026
[As Clay Davis from <i>The Wire]</i>
<i>Shit.</i>

405
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:26,363
You're into <i>The Wire?</i>

406
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,986
Both: shit.

407
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,015
Jessica.

408
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,135
What a lovely coincidence
running into you in Toronto.

409
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:49,836
This is not a coincidence.

410
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:51,584
Well, I hope it's still going
to be lovely.

411
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:54,774
I need you to make it
perfectly clear to Harvey

412
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,176
that he has no say

413
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,028
in the Hessington Oil
takeover battle.

414
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,679
And why would I do that?

415
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,231
Because he's making
a huge mistake and using

416
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,866
- your name to do it.
- And let me guess,

417
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,118
you'd like her to remove herself
from management.

418
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,020
She can do it herself,

419
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,705
or I can do it for her.

420
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,791
But either way
she's got to go

421
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,026
until this trial is over.

422
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:14,628
I'm afraid
I don't see it that way.

423
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:15,745
Well, you're wrong.

424
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,882
And you're overstepping.

425
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:21,334
Listen to me.

426
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:24,304
She stands to lose control
of this company permanently

427
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,388
if we don't do something.

428
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:27,057
Then do something.

429
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:30,393
I'm trying,
but you're cutting off my legs

430
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:32,262
because of a bond you had
with her father.

431
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:35,215
No, because I value
relationships over money.

432
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:37,901
Well, I value the terms
of our merger.

433
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,320
And Hessington Oil was one
of your biggest selling points.

434
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:42,489
And Harvey Specter
one of yours.

435
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:44,436
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

436
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:48,411
Then don't.
But Ava isn't going anywhere.

437
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:50,564
One more thing.

438
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:52,566
Instead of spending firm money
to fly

439
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,568
to another country
to question my judgment,

440
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,036
feel free to call first.

441
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,838
I'll be happy to give you
the same answer over the phone.

442
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,512
This is brilliant.

443
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,930
We've got the connection.

444
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,765
We just need to figure out
how to stop it.

445
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,434
I already have.

446
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,753
This is great work, Katrina.
You struck oil.

447
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:16,773
It was actually Mike's idea.

448
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,024
Why do you want
to give him credit?

449
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,976
Because if I don't,
you won't listen

450
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,478
when I say
you should take him with you.

451
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:22,862
I'm not taking anyone
with me.

452
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,482
It's an opportunity
for him to see you

453
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,734
beat the shit
out of a living legend.

454
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:32,072
Tony Gianopolous
gets blown out of the water,

455
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,156
and Mike gets blown away.

456
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,958
And Jessica hears
about it all.

457
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm gonna suggest this
to Harvey.

458
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:38,995
Feel free to tell him
it was all your idea.

459
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,632
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, perfect timing.

460
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:43,800
Harvey, I was just gonna run
something by you.

461
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,051
I don't have time, Louis.

462
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,670
I'm working on a murder case.

463
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,455
I just dropped by to inform you

464
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:51,341
Mike's coming with you
to see Gianopolous.

465
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,959
Like hell he is.

466
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:55,178
- Excuse me?
- I'm not taking anyone.

467
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:56,813
- Louis--
- And don't Louis me.

468
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,798
This is my case, and you've
been sticking your nose in it

469
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,151
- ever since I got it.
- Sticking my nose in?

470
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,402
You only have this case

471
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:03,970
'cause I was kind enough
to give it to you.

472
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,323
You only gave it to me
because you hadn't realized

473
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,474
that you were responsible for
turning Ava's bribery charges

474
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,826
into murder charges.

475
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,145
- You're off this case.
- Go ahead.

476
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,747
Call Ava.

477
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:15,198
Tell her that you're diverting
your attention

478
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:17,334
from her murder trial
to work on this.

479
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,153
Yup.
Didn't think so.

480
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:21,821
Get out of my office
because I got a meeting

481
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,957
to prepare for.

482
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,879
What just happened to him?

483
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:31,848
- He got "Litt" up.
- Damn straight.

484
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:36,713
Have you seen this?

485
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:37,747
It's an article,

486
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:39,048
in today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

487
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,633
painting me as the picture
of corporate greed.

488
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,468
As I told you before,
if you speak out--

489
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,804
I have the chance
to save my company.

490
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,095
Louis Litt is doing that
right now.

491
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,864
- That is not the point.
- That is the point.

492
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,472
We can still save your company,

493
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,525
and you won't have to hurt
yourself at your murder trial.

494
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,477
No, the point is I want
to speak at my murder trial.

495
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,529
That's not wise.

496
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,747
And how many murder trials

497
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,315
have you conducted
in your many years?

498
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,500
- Ava.
- Silence is damning.

499
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,836
Look at this article.
I'm already guilty.

500
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,004
If you take the stand,

501
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:07,423
Cameron Dennis is gonna rip you
to shreds.

502
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,042
This is not up for discussion.
I will have my say.

503
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,011
Then I'm gonna show you
what you're in for.

504
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:14,263
Well, you wouldn't be doing
your job if you didn't.

505
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,104
Have a seat,
Mr. Litt.

506
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,839
I'll be with you
in a minute.

507
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,358
You'll be with me?

508
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,943
Yes. As I said.
In a minute.

509
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:29,178
Uhhuh.

510
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:30,563
Well, you know,
I'd ask you who you are,

511
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,849
but the truth is I, uh...

512
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,851
I don't really give a shit.

513
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,570
Where the hell's
Tony Gianopolous?

514
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,405
Mr. Gianopolous is upstairs.

515
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,874
To get upstairs, you have to get
through those doors.

516
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,327
And to get through those doors
you have to get through me.

517
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:47,079
And you're not getting
through me.

518
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,719
Well, perhaps I have the key.

519
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,041
This is a balance sheet
from one of our subsidiaries.

520
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,476
This is nothing.

521
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,594
Sorry.
Forgot.

522
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,213
It's a combination lock.

523
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,383
This represents the totality
of Gianopolous Limited holdings.

524
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,069
You control 40%
of the U.S. radio stations,

525
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:11,737
corn production,
interstate trucking,

526
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:12,988
and that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

527
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,690
Looks like I picked
the right employer.

528
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,360
One problem: Hessington Oil
owns enough of those industries

529
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:20,496
to get you in trouble
with the FTC.

530
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,898
Yeah.
Think we wouldn't find that?

531
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,734
You think we wouldn't?

532
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:26,035
These folders are out of date.

533
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,086
We've already divested.

534
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,573
Into this, this, and this.

535
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,910
So what? Hessington doesn't
have holdings in those areas.

536
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,912
They do now.

537
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,264
And if you don't leave 'em
alone,

538
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:40,082
you're gonna be tied up
with my friend from the FTC

539
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,935
until kingdom goddamn come.

540
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:46,122
Got that, spank?

541
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:47,890
Then it's a good thing
Mr. Gianopolous

542
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,609
arranged an exception for us
over dinner with his friend,

543
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:55,648
the commissioner of the FTC.

544
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,366
- That's not--
- Legal?

545
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:59,318
Yes, it is.
As long as we disclose it.

546
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,953
Which we always do.

547
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,455
You think
you're the first lawyer

548
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,772
to try to outsmart us?

549
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,907
We're not lawyers.

550
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,958
We're investment bankers.

551
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,942
We call you for the paperwork.

552
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,377
We didn't go to Harvard.

553
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:10,546
We went to Wharton,
and we saw you coming

554
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,882
a mile away.

555
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:15,668
[Thud]
Spank.

556
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,220
Oh, by the way, Mr. Gianopolous
is in Monaco.

557
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:21,807
Christina will validate you
on the way out.

558
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:28,514
Finally cleaning up?

559
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,816
Can't stay here forever.

560
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,569
How'd your meeting
with Ava go?

561
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,521
She wants to testify
at her own trial.

562
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,639
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, I know.

563
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,741
We're working on it.

564
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,476
Thought you'd be with Louis.

565
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,312
He went to go see Gianopolous
by himself.

566
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,664
I hope it works.

567
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:48,334
We have a good plan.

568
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:51,670
For what it's worth,

569
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:54,757
I suggested Louis
take you with him.

570
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:57,760
Shit.

571
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,161
[Chuckles]

572
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,546
As Sil would say,

573
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,664
"just when I thought I was out,

574
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,300
they pull me back in."

575
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:06,519
Okay, so you watch
<i>The Sopranos</i> too?

576
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:07,770
Nobody watches <i>The Wire</i>

577
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,890
without starting
with <i>The Sopranos.</i>

578
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,131
You, uh, you really
suggest that to Louis?

579
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,067
It was your idea.
You deserve the credit.

580
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,008
Truce?

581
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,028
Truce.

582
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:33,231
Both: Shit.

583
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:38,786
You trying to score some extra
edamame from the delivery guy?

584
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:42,123
Please, Yuki always brings me
extra edamame.

585
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,192
Well, then who's
the touch-up for?

586
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:50,214
And did you do a costume change
without leaving the office?

587
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,884
I have a number
that calls a guy...

588
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,448
Who knows my size.
I need that number.

589
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,921
- I can't give you that number.
- Mm.

590
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,425
Oh, my God.
You have a date with Stephen.

591
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,209
It's not really a date.

592
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,395
It's more...

593
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,798
- of an arrangement.
- An arrangement?

594
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,267
He has some short-term needs,
asked if I could help him out

595
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,918
while he's in town,
blah blah blah,

596
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,470
I'm meeting him at 8:00.

597
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,639
Blah blah blah?

598
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:15,857
What's blah blah blah?

599
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:18,193
Oh, you know,
it's just...

600
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,094
- This, that, and the other thing.
- Uh huh.

601
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:22,814
And does he know
that blah blah blah constitutes

602
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,866
- this, that, and the other thing?
- Rachel.

603
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,786
Stephen and I communicate
a little more subtly--

604
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,572
suggestive banter,
double entendres.

605
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:32,207
We both know
what we agreed to.

606
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:33,241
It sounds to me
like you agreed

607
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,626
to a hot and steamy affair.

608
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,944
I'm not gonna even
dignify that with a response.

609
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:39,714
Oh, my God, did you agree
to a hot and steamy affair?

610
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,516
I have no idea.

611
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,873
- Louis, what can I do for you?
- I want off this case.

612
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,024
I take it you struck out
with Gianopolous?

613
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:51,359
I didn't strike out.

614
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,794
What I did was almost pull
a rabbit out of a hat.

615
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:55,046
But the truth is
the one good move we had

616
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,464
has been taken away from us,

617
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:57,799
and I'm not gonna be left
holding the bag

618
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,584
because Harvey chose
to handcuff me.

619
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:04,055
Louis, I'm not taking you
off this case.

620
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,257
But I am taking
the handcuffs off.

621
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:11,813
Wait, are you saying
that I have your blessing

622
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,266
to go to the board and convince
them to ditch Ava Hessington?

623
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:18,012
I'm not saying anything.

624
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,513
Got it.

625
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,632
Wet work.

626
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:25,753
This conversation
never happened.

627
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,555
What is it?

628
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:30,107
Have you ever said to Harvey,

629
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:31,552
"this conversation
never happened"?

630
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,493
- Louis.
- Please tell me you never have.

631
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,862
Would I tell you if I had?

632
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:36,913
I'll take that as a no.

633
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:38,665
Good night, Louis.

634
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,567
Black Swan.

635
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:48,341
[Recorder beeps]

636
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,244
Wednesday, 6:52 p.m.,

637
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,847
it happened.

638
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,096
Wow.

639
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:11,865
You aren't having
a heart attack, are you?

640
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:14,267
Would that put a crimp
in your evening?

641
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:15,485
Well, I guess I could scalp
your ticket,

642
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,788
seeing as it is the hottest
of the season.

643
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:20,991
You know, I practically had
to sell my spleen for them.

644
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:22,743
That's funny. I heard
you got them from a client.

645
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,961
Did you also hear
that I traded him my spleen?

646
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:26,830
I don't care if it cost you
a lung.

647
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:30,250
Daniel Day-Lewis in a kilt?
Worth it.

648
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:32,952
- I'm really glad to hear that.
- Of course you are.

649
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:35,338
You found out
how much I love the theater.

650
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:37,557
You don't think the reason
that I arranged all of this

651
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,959
is because I looked
into you?

652
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:41,795
Didn't you?

653
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,296
Sure I did.

654
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,065
You know,
I'm actually to theater

655
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:46,316
what Harvey is to sport.

656
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,934
Nah, you don't give a shit
about theater.

657
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:50,136
You love sports.

658
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:51,905
- Rugby mostly.
- Nice try.

659
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:53,607
We do what we can.

660
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:54,825
But we are going for dinner

661
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:56,193
with Daniel Day-Lewis
after the show.

662
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:57,744
You're kidding.

663
00:26:57,812 --> 00:26:59,246
I may be indifferent
to the theater,

664
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,248
but I know
how to get things done.

665
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:02,699
You are good.

666
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,485
I told you that
on the first day we met.

667
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,488
I'm better than good.

668
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,824
What time is dinner?

669
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,042
10:30.

670
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,760
Then we better get going.

671
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,213
Oh, the show doesn't start
for another 20 minutes.

672
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:20,166
We aren't going to the show.

673
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:25,188
Taxi!

674
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,982
Is that really necessary?

675
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,317
It will be in the deposition.?

676
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:32,706
I don't care
about the deposition.

677
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,153
- Harvey--
- You want to know

678
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,239
how you come across, you have
to see how you come across.

679
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,607
Now answer my question.

680
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,893
Did you bribe
a foreign government?

681
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,538
Why are you hesitating,
Miss Hessington?

682
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,840
- Something to hide?
- Look, I think what Harvey's

683
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,342
- trying to say--
- You hesitate,

684
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:47,093
they won't trust you.

685
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:48,378
Your bribery
isn't in question.

686
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,646
Cameron is gonna enter that plea
into evidence.

687
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,264
You have to own it
and move on.

688
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,910
And I suggest you do it
more believably,

689
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:55,235
because when you're up there
staring down the barrel

690
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,237
of 12 executioners,

691
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:59,272
there's no changing your mind.

692
00:27:59,357 --> 00:28:00,990
Do you think I don't know
you're trying to rattle me?

693
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:03,059
Rattle you?
I'm just giving you the facts.

694
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,612
Cameron's gonna rattle you.

695
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:06,996
And it's gonna work,

696
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,915
because you and I both
know you did this.

697
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:11,251
- How dare you!
- How dare I what?

698
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:12,369
This is your idea.

699
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:14,003
Then ask me
a goddamn question.

700
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,288
You bribed that government.

701
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:17,207
What's to stop anyone
with a pulse

702
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:20,009
from believing you knew
that money was payment

703
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:21,311
for killing those people?

704
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,513
Because life is more important
to me than money.

705
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,082
Then why the hell did you pay
that bribe in the first place?

706
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:27,653
Because that's how it works
over there.

707
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:29,552
Murder is also how it works
over there.

708
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:31,354
You did it.
You know it.

709
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:34,090
And you're not
convincing anyone.

710
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:36,860
Very good.

711
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:40,596
Finally we get to it.

712
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:42,282
If you check your records,

713
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:45,285
you'd know the reason we won
that bid is we were

714
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,437
the only company who took it
upon ourselves

715
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,771
to go to the people.

716
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:51,241
Because you needed to see
what your obstacle was.

717
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,960
My obstacle?

718
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:57,247
We paid $100 million more
than anyone else

719
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:01,551
on the condition that the money
be used to relocate any family

720
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:05,555
who lost anything within
50 miles of that pipeline--

721
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:10,477
job, home, land, livestock.

722
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,462
Anything.

723
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:15,398
What happened over there
sickens me.

724
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,735
I lose sleep over it
every night.

725
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:22,188
And as soon as I am
out of this nightmare,

726
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,991
I am going to shut down
the entire project--

727
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:29,996
the pipeline, the oil fields,
all of it.

728
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,815
So I've had just about enough
of you two wondering

729
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:35,651
whether I'm guilty
of these murders or not.

730
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:39,456
Is that a good enough trial run
for you?

731
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,517
Holy shit.

732
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,019
She didn't do it.

733
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:56,439
I understand
you have a strategy

734
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,341
to defeat the takeover attempt.

735
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,360
I do.
But it involves a conversation

736
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,312
about how essential
you find Ava Hessington.

737
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,680
If the only way
to beat Tony Gianopolous

738
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:05,949
is to get rid of her,

739
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,416
then I don't think
we have a choice.

740
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,619
If you need cover
for the other board members,

741
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:12,038
then you can just tell them that
Pearson Darby recommended that.

742
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:14,023
And I'll recommend to them

743
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,042
that we retain
Pearson Darby.

744
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:18,044
So we have a deal.

745
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:31,257
What's the matter with you?

746
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:37,514
We just deposed
Ava Hessington.

747
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:38,898
You deposed
your own client?

748
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,150
Practice.

749
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:42,819
You couldn't convince her
not to testify?

750
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:47,240
[Scoffs]
No, not that.

751
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:49,409
She convinced us
that maybe she should.

752
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:53,896
Well, there would be only one
reason to even consider that.

753
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,616
She didn't do it.

754
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,585
- No way.
- I know.

755
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:00,503
You said, if she's cold enough
to do it,

756
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:02,738
she'd be cold enough
to lie about it,

757
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,626
but this woman is about to lose
her title, her company,

758
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,847
her whole life...

759
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:13,266
And I know
that she is telling the truth.

760
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,223
You don't have to believe me.

761
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:23,810
Take a look for yourself.

762
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:30,199
- Hey.
- What happened?

763
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,785
- He agreed.
- She's out.

764
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,438
It'll be done tomorrow
before the tender offer vote.

765
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,690
- Then we still have time.
- What are you talking about?

766
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,577
She's innocent.

767
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,879
What?

768
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:46,165
Take a look at this.

769
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,041
I figured out
what we're gonna do.

770
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:53,006
And what is that?

771
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,290
What we should have done
in the first place.

772
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:56,392
We're gonna let her talk
to the board.

773
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,344
And preempt tomorrow's meeting
with one of our own.

774
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,979
If she can convince us
she's innocent,

775
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,564
she can convince them
to keep her in charge

776
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:04,484
- and vote against the takeover.
- Winwin.

777
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,302
- Have Louis set it up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Louis?

778
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:08,021
Yeah.
He'll love it.

779
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:09,639
Letting her talk
is what he wanted her

780
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,740
to do in the first place.

781
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:12,808
Get it done.

782
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:24,654
Louis, what are you
still doing here?

783
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:25,988
You put in a long day.

784
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,625
You did a great job.
Now go home.

785
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:29,825
I can't.

786
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:31,827
Why not?

787
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,546
She didn't do it.

788
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:37,684
Who didn't do what?

789
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:41,437
Ava Hessington had nothing
to do with those murders.

790
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:46,943
How do you like that?

791
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,091
I'll see you
in the morning.

792
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:50,780
Jessica.

793
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:54,534
I'm serious.
She's innocent.

794
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,402
And what does that have to do
with me going home tonight?

795
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:59,038
It has everything
to do with it.

796
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:00,707
Harvey agreed to let her
talk to the board.

797
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,024
That's all I ever wanted.

798
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:04,193
Louis, if they don't oust her
tomorrow morning,

799
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:07,630
they will lose that takeover
vote tomorrow afternoon.

800
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,382
She will be pushed out
either way.

801
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:10,667
Well, at least
I won't be responsible

802
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,669
for taking away
an innocent woman's company.

803
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,303
You're not responsible for it.

804
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:16,839
This is a hostile takeover.

805
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,475
They're coming tomorrow,
and the market doesn't care

806
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:20,810
whether she's innocent or not.

807
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:21,928
Harvey's gonna think
it was me.

808
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:23,379
It was you.

809
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,398
And he would have thought that
before.

810
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:28,551
Please do not stop me

811
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,319
from going back to that board.

812
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:32,655
Louis, you offered
to do this.

813
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:34,240
You're not doing this to Harvey.

814
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:36,159
You're doing this
for your client,

815
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:37,493
Hessington Oil.

816
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,562
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

817
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,230
- Not anymore.
- Jessica.

818
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:43,332
Enough.

819
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,067
This conversation did happen,

820
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,570
and it's over.

821
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,843
How long have
you been standing there?

822
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,176
Long enough to know
that if this law thing

823
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:08,763
doesn't work out, you'd make
a lousy boy Friday.

824
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,232
I'd ask you to help, but I
wouldn't want to take advantage.

825
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,902
And I'd say yes, but I don't
want to be taken advantage of.

826
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,654
Though I am happy to watch.

827
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm nothing but a piece
of meat to you, aren't I?

828
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,942
Quiet, copy boy.

829
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:25,112
Same time tomorrow night?

830
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,782
Absolutely.

831
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,289
Interesting.

832
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,076
If you find copy rooms
interesting,

833
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:40,678
you need to get out more.

834
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,630
Oh, I'm not talking
about the copy room.

835
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,081
I'm talking about you
and Stephen

836
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,292
and the spring in your steps.

837
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,750
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say

838
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,935
you were sleeping with him.

839
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,771
Oh, my God,
you slept with him, didn't you?

840
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,589
No.

841
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,774
How was it?

842
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,645
Suffice it to say,
I was awesome.

843
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,029
Oh, wait, sorry,
you probably wanted to know

844
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,064
- about him, didn't you?
- That was the point

845
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:01,449
- of the question, yes.
- Eh.

846
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,950
- Really?
- God, no.

847
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,785
- I may have met my match.
- Oh, my God.

848
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,036
- And the arrangement?
- Ongoing.

849
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,938
- Well, did you tell Harvey?
- Oh, my God.

850
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,941
- What?
- I never thought about Harvey.

851
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,243
I'm Donna. How could I
have not thought of that?

852
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:13,828
Because you weren't thinking
with your brain.

853
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,496
- Good one.
- You were thinking with your--

854
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,283
- Yeah, I got it.
- So what are you gonna do?

855
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:22,119
I'm gonna tell him
as soon as he gets back.

856
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:30,978
- Have everything we need?
- Everything.

857
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,313
Where's Louis?

858
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,597
He's gonna meet us over there.

859
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,316
We should all be going
together.

860
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,735
Well, at least Ava's here
on time.

861
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,355
- What the hell did you do?
- What are you talking about?

862
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,640
I just got voted out
of my own company.

863
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:44,892
Wait, the vote on the takeover

864
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,243
isn't supposed to be
till this afternoon.

865
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,245
Well, they had a different one
before that,

866
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,479
and I'm out.

867
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,415
And what I want to know is,
did you know?

868
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,417
Ava, I didn't go
behind your back.

869
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,336
Well, you may not have gone
behind my back,

870
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,670
but this never would have
happened if you'd let me

871
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,672
speak publicly
in the first place.

872
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:02,126
Look, Ava, my believing
in your innocence

873
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:04,295
wouldn't change my mind
about you talking to a reporter.

874
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,846
Then why were you going
to let me speak today?

875
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,664
Because an interview
isn't the same thing

876
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:09,934
as a closed-door meeting
within your own company.

877
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,268
Well, they had
a closed-door meeting,

878
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,687
and the only person
who benefited from that was you.

879
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:14,805
How's that?

880
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:17,341
I may be out,
but you're not.

881
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:20,844
Pearson Darby has been
conveniently retained

882
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:25,032
as Hessington Oil's
legal counsel.

883
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,151
You think I don't know
this was you?

884
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:29,186
I don't care whether you know
it was me or not.

885
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,455
I stand by what I did,
and I'd do it again.

886
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,573
You mean selling Ava out

887
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:33,908
because of your personal issues
with me?

888
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,577
This isn't personal,
and it's not about you.

889
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,862
Bullshit.
Ever since Darby handed me

890
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,881
this case and not you,
you've been pissed.

891
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,867
I wasn't pissed until we had
a disagreement on strategy,

892
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,136
and you invoked his name
to cut me out.

893
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,755
I get it.

894
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,590
I wasn't wrong
about it being personal.

895
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,091
I was wrong
about which person.

896
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,426
You're not pissed at me.

897
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,645
You're pissed at yourself
for getting played.

898
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,513
What did you just say to me?

899
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:57,598
You heard me.

900
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,099
Fools rush in,

901
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,768
and you're the one
who gave him the 51%

902
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,355
in the first place.

903
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:07,608
I merged with Edward
for the sake of this firm,

904
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,994
just like what I did today
with Ava.

905
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,581
And the only one in this room
taking things personally is you.

906
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,232
Tell yourself
whatever you want,

907
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,900
but don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby

908
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,119
and don't tell me
it isn't personal,

909
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,122
because you can't stand
being number two.

910
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,095
- Harvey, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

911
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,748
I need Edward Darby
on the phone right now.

912
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,376
By the way,
where were you this morning?

913
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,350
What are you talking about?
I was here.

914
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,584
You weren't here.

915
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,253
I was in the copy room.

916
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:38,422
Well, what the hell were you
doing in the copy room?

917
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,475
I was finishing up
a couple things for Stephen.

918
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,143
You're working for Stephen?

919
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:46,196
- I made some copies.
- You work for me.

920
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,932
Sorry.

921
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,068
It was a one-time thing.
Well, since you haven't gotten

922
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,037
Darby for me yet,
what do you want?

923
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,206
Nothing.
It can wait.

924
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,059
What do you want?

925
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,095
I want to tell you
that I enjoyed working with you.

926
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:21,849
I thought I was gonna be able
to say the same.

927
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,151
If it means anything to you,
I told Louis

928
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,686
to stop the plan
to get rid of Ava.

929
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,022
Did you know
he wasn't going to?

930
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,773
No.

931
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:32,476
But the truth is,
even if I did,

932
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,662
I wouldn't have done anything
to stop it.

933
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,281
Is that supposed
to make me believe you?

934
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:40,584
It's supposed to make you
understand me.

935
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,539
You're loyal to him.

936
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,926
I'm committed to him.

937
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,462
Good night, Katrina.

938
00:38:51,513 --> 00:38:55,182
Good night.

939
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,810
What did she want?

940
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:09,196
Nothing.

941
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,398
Tell me
she enjoyed working with me.

942
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,202
- Did you?
- Did I what?

943
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,870
Did you enjoy
working with her?

944
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:21,075
I mean, I just kept seeing
you guys working together

945
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,961
all the time, and you just
seemed to be bonding away.

946
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,130
- Are you jealous?
- It's not funny.

947
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,749
I'm not smiling
because it's funny.

948
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,634
I'm smiling
because it's sweet.

949
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,202
You didn't think it was sweet
when I was jealous

950
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:33,303
of you and Jenny.

951
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,972
You and I
weren't together then,

952
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,142
- but we are now.
- Right.

953
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,894
Which is why
it bothers me more now.

954
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,847
Rachel...

955
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:46,216
I trusted you
with my secret,

956
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,435
my life.

957
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,020
If I trusted you with that,
don't you know that

958
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,057
that means I...

959
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,094
That I...

960
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,064
What are you--
what are you trying to say?

961
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:02,666
You know
what I'm trying to say.

962
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,786
Don't say it now.
I don't want to hear it here.

963
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,088
Here? Where we've done
pretty much everything else?

964
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,759
- Mike, I--
- I love you.

965
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,927
I love you.

966
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,096
I don't want
to keep it in anymore.

967
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,584
[Chuckles]

968
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,219
I love you too.

969
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,272
And in this moment
I don't care who knows.

970
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,548
What you did amounts

971
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,500
to nothing short
of insubordination.

972
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,585
Did you fly all the way

973
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:55,785
from another country
to tell me that?

974
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:56,954
You could have just called.

975
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,622
I gave you
a very clear directive,

976
00:40:58,673 --> 00:40:59,640
and you defied me.

977
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,641
Do you want to get into it?

978
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:01,692
I most certainly do.

979
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,093
When I agreed to merge
with you,

980
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,645
I knew it was 51-49,

981
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,630
but I didn't think
you would lord your 2%

982
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,599
over me like a hammer.

983
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,068
And when I agreed
to acquire you,

984
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,186
I didn't think
I'd have to.

985
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,570
Are you saying
you regret this merger?

986
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,189
I'm saying perhaps I
should have paid more attention

987
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,490
to the red flags,

988
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,858
such as covering up
the embezzlement

989
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,359
of a former partner.

990
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,361
Something you were more than
willing to use to make the deal.

991
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,413
You went behind my back.

992
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,998
And you stuck me
with this case

993
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,001
and then risked losing me
a huge amount of money.

994
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,787
I gave Harvey this case
after already handing you

995
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,039
a huge amount of money.

996
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,542
I am in charge
on this side of the ocean.

997
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,211
Because I allow it
to be that way.

998
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,512
And there it is again.

999
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,265
51-49.

1000
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,501
Until now I believed
that Harvey was the wild horse

1001
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,687
that couldn't be tamed,
but perhaps it is you.

1002
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,672
[Chuckles]
I think maybe Harvey was right.

1003
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,224
It is personal.

1004
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,508
But I didn't make it that way.

1005
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,694
You did when you allowed
your feelings

1006
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,029
for Ava
to cloud your judgment.

1007
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,815
And as you pointed out,
I had a partner once

1008
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:01,518
who made decisions
based on his personal shit,

1009
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,871
and I will not allow that
to happen again.

1010
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,989
And 51-49 or not,

1011
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,243
I just took 14 million and put
it on my side of the ledger,

1012
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,128
so do me a favor, Edward,
and turn off the lights

1013
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,247
on your way out.

1014
