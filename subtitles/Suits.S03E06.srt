00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,280
<font color="#ffffff">Harvey:</font>

2
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:03,652
I lost Ava her company.

3
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:06,000
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

4
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,871
As long as you win
her murder trial,

5
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:10,007
you'll be
the next managing partner.

6
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:11,542
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

7
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:13,544
I can see that.

8
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,379
So you're not upset?

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,765
No.

10
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,383
I got an interview.

11
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:20,551
Look, I'm sorry, I just didn't
know how to tell you, Mike.

12
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:21,902
I don't know,
how about,

13
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:23,688
"hey, Mike, I might go
to law school 3,000 miles away"?

14
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,325
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

15
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,244
This is about me getting
personal with Donna.

16
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,062
Chain of custody is something
I know a little bit about,

17
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,114
thanks to you.

18
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,248
Save yourself
the embarrassment

19
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,566
and cancel this trial.

20
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,501
We're in the ring,
I'm still standing,

21
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:38,869
and this isn't done.

22
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,738
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow.

23
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,906
And this is your way
of getting me on your side?

24
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,209
I don't want you
on my side.

25
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,378
I want us to be
on the same side.

26
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,603
- You look happy.
- Do I?

27
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,605
Why?

28
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,275
Um, I don't know, Donna,
it's hard to explain.

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,643
All right,
I'll tell you.

30
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,368
Mikado finally slept
in my bed last night,

31
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,636
and when I woke up
this morning,

32
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,947
it felt like the whole world
was hugging me.

33
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,599
I lost 9 ounces.

34
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,984
My teeth whiteners
are working.

35
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:11,902
I found five new hairs
on the top of my head.

36
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,571
And to top it all off,
I just found out

37
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:16,106
that Esther broke her foot
in three places.

38
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:17,124
Your sister?

39
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,609
Yeah, crutches
for seven months.

40
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,112
Serves her right.
Dad's favorite.

41
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,619
Mm.

42
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,808
I need a day.

43
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:44,935
Dom Perignon's on ice

44
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:46,354
and Bloomberg's
closing Broadway

45
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,805
for the ticker-tape parade.

46
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,657
You saw the sign?

47
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,492
Yeah, dream come true
for any lawyer.

48
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:53,811
I don't have dreams.
I have goals.

49
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,814
Now it's on
to the next one.

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,371
When did you find out?

51
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,455
Last night.

52
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:05,873
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,591
I shouldn't have to.

54
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,009
Meaning?

55
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,712
Meaning your focus hasn't
been where it usually is.

56
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,677
Okay, meaning that my focus
has been on Stephen.

57
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:16,434
If that's what you mean,
then just say it.

58
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,668
Just admit that it bothers you
about me and him.

59
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,169
I'm not admitting anything

60
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,771
because there's nothing
to admit.

61
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,190
And Stephen or not,
you know as well as I do

62
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,692
I've never had
to tell you a thing.

63
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,111
You've always just known.

64
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,699
- You've had too much coffee.
- What are you talking about?

65
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,067
After two cups,
your signature slants.

66
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,201
After three,
it scrawls.

67
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:35,786
And after four,
it's chicken scratch.

68
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,054
They're not gonna
accept these.

69
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,122
You're crazy.

70
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,039
How many cups
have you had today?

71
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:40,858
Five.

72
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,693
How'd you do that?

73
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,044
It's what I do.

74
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,531
I read, I analyze, I fix.

75
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:49,834
Bullshit.

76
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,720
You're wearing
a blue shirt,

77
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:54,388
which means you won big
in poker last night.

78
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,840
You missed a spot shaving,

79
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,675
which means you had
less than five hours of sleep.

80
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,009
And your left wrist,

81
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,179
which you claim you sprained
playing basketball,

82
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,898
still hasn't healed
because your loud tie is hanging

83
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,267
ever so slightly
to the left.

84
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:09,019
Loud, by the way, because
you won big in poker last night.

85
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,237
For your information,

86
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,222
I didn't lose sleep
just because of poker.

87
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,558
Yeah, you did.

88
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,776
Melanie's not
in the picture anymore.

89
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,745
- You knew about Melanie?
- And Charlotte.

90
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,530
And Nadia.

91
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,499
Okay, I don't want you
working for me anymore.

92
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,734
Harvey, stop playing
footsie with your secretary.

93
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:25,336
Mackenzie brothers
are here.

94
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:27,121
We need to get
these assholes to cave.

95
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:30,240
I had an idea.
Nite owl murders.

96
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,376
We're not using an idea
you got from <i>L.A. Confidential.</i>

97
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,462
How is that different
from you shooting a dead guy

98
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:36,630
just because Sean Connery
did it in <i>The Untouchables?</i>

99
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:38,582
[Imitating Sean Connery]
What are you prepared to do?

100
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,518
Is that supposed
to be Sean Connery?

101
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,387
Don't even think that you
can do Connery better than me.

102
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:46,223
[Imitating Sean Connery]
Junior.

103
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:47,608
[Imitating Sean Connery]
He's a lying member

104
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,610
of a no-good race.

105
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:51,479
Ease up, James Bond.

106
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,730
So you gonna come out
and say it?

107
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,731
Say what?

108
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,150
All those observations.

109
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,152
You're into me.

110
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,906
I'm not into you.
I'm Donna.

111
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,240
What's that
supposed to mean?

112
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,158
It means I could do
the same thing with Bertha

113
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,442
that I did with you.

114
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,328
All that means is that
you're into Bertha too.

115
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,496
Ooh, what if I am?

116
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,280
We can have
a threesome.

117
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,083
Trust me, if you were ever
lucky enough to have me,

118
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:16,086
you wouldn't want to share.

119
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,846
Dude, you gonna share
that shit with me or what?

120
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,515
Negatory.

121
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,849
Mmhmm.

122
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,684
All right, you can have some,
but take it easy.

123
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,319
It's gotta last
until tomorrow.

124
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,971
I thought you had
3 ounces.

125
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,640
I sold it.
Daddy's gotta eat.

126
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:37,658
Wait a minute,
you're dealing now?

127
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:38,859
Friends and family,
asshole.

128
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,611
What are you, AT&T?

129
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:41,996
What are you, the FCC?

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,164
You don't even know
what that is.

131
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,449
- Yes, I do.
- Really?

132
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,452
Tell me what they do.
I'll give you $500.

133
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:49,837
You're a dick.

134
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,672
A dick who just got
a hundred on his Calc midterm.

135
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:53,841
You got the results back
already?

136
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,292
No, but trust me,
hundred.

137
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:56,794
You know who else
thinks you're a dick?

138
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,161
That math test.

139
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,830
Well, that's fine,
because I just made it my bitch.

140
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:03,000
Up top, mother flecker!

141
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,718
Whoa, you're gonna
leave me hanging?

142
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:08,806
Like you're gonna
leave me hanging?

143
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,941
You got into Harvard,
dickhead.

144
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,980
They accepted
my transfer?

145
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,481
Yeah, they did.

146
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,316
Holy goddamn shit.

147
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,369
Wait a minute,
you read my mail?

148
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:23,571
What's the point
of going through it

149
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,372
if I'm not gonna read it?
I hate you.

150
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:28,358
[Both cheer]
Yeah, mother flecker!

151
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,827
Holy shit, dude.

152
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,913
We gotta celebrate.
Yeah.

153
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,165
Those douche bags over
at A.E. Pi are having a party.

154
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:36,199
It's on.

155
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,635
It's still on.

156
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:38,919
There's a reason Cameron
hasn't raised the white flag

157
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,170
with Ava yet.

158
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,472
What is it?

159
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,206
I was filing our motion
to dismiss

160
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,009
when I noticed his office
faxed the court

161
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,226
from the Waldorf Astoria.

162
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,395
He's been booking rooms
all over Manhattan.

163
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,014
And turns out
two days ago,

164
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,649
he also called in
the U.S. Marshals.

165
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,067
Protective custody.

166
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,653
- 20 men strong.
- Shit.

167
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,887
This case isn't over.

168
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,256
He's got
another goddamn witness.

180
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,363
Rachel, come on,
let's just sit down,

181
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,161
for ten minutes, please.
This is ridiculous.

182
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:39,471
I can't.
I don't wanna miss my flight.

183
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,522
You're not gonna
miss your flight.

184
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:42,140
It doesn't leave
for another three hours.

185
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,525
And you're supposed
to be there two hours before,

186
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,843
and the airport's
an hour away.

187
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,228
And you know what, instead
of giving me a hard time

188
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,013
about my travel habits,

189
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,315
it'd be nice if you'd just
come with me to the airport.

190
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,017
Rachel, you know the case
I'm working on,

191
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,202
you know the deadline,
and you know the stakes.

192
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,687
What I know is you don't
want me to visit Stanford

193
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,372
because you don't want me
to go to Stanford.

194
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,207
I never said that.

195
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,876
I just said I wish you had
told me that you had applied.

196
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,744
Well, I did,
and now you're being shitty

197
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,069
because you don't
want me to go,

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,414
and you won't even
just admit it.

199
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,865
Look, do you really want this
to be easy for me?

200
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,834
All I wanted is for you
to tell me

201
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:11,870
to have a good trip
and to mean it.

202
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,646
Have a good trip.

203
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,160
Okay, you're telling me
that if I can guess

204
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:39,865
your exact birthday,
you will kiss me right here.

205
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,085
If you can guess
my birthday,

206
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,369
I'll kiss you...

207
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,570
[Whispers inaudibly]

208
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,906
Wow.

209
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,008
That is very detailed.

210
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:52,210
All right,
I'm ready to get started.

211
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,795
Uh, I need 360--

212
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,481
I'm sorry, I gotta borrow
my friend here.

213
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,049
I need to borrow my friend
just for a second.

214
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,416
No, no, Trevor, 'cause we're
right in the middle of a thing.

215
00:07:58,468 --> 00:07:59,968
I'm doing the birthday thing.
What are you doing?

216
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,773
I just found out
behind that door over there

217
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:04,422
is a poker game filled
with drunk A.E. Pi brothers.

218
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:05,941
No way!
Yeah, that's a great idea.

219
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,093
I should totally not pursue
this hot girl.

220
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,528
Dude, whatever,
you're always telling me

221
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:10,612
you're Mr. <i>rounders.</i>

222
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:11,780
Let's go take
their money.

223
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:12,931
Come on,
we're here to drink booze

224
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,265
and hit on chicks,

225
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,568
not sit in the dark
and play with a bunch of dudes.

226
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,654
Come on, now where was--

227
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:20,822
what?

228
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,290
Totally not cool, man.

229
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,459
- Of her or of you?
- Whatever.

230
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,945
Whoa, hey, excuse me.

231
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,914
Our house, our rules,
asshole.

232
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:30,165
Oh!

233
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,416
Douche bag.

234
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,801
Man, forget him.

235
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:34,669
Nah, I can't.

236
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,122
First week freshman year,
I was playing basketball.

237
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,123
He showed up with three
of his buddies.

238
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:39,891
I go up for a lay-up,

239
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,227
he comes in,
lays me out.

240
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,645
Stands over me and says,

241
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,131
"What are you gonna
do about it?"

242
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,967
I let it go.

243
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,469
I'm not letting it go
this time.

244
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:52,938
Let's roll.

245
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:55,690
You wanted to see me?

246
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,944
Mackenzie brothers.

247
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,980
I got 'em 25 years apiece.

248
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,314
You?

249
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,150
You wouldn't have gotten shit
without me.

250
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:07,369
Nite owl murders, baby.

251
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,837
Oh, don't do that.

252
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:11,173
What kind of person doesn't
high-five another person?

253
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,874
A person
who's not ten years old.

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,826
Oh, so you mean
like a dick.

255
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,796
No, I mean, like the guy
that can fire you on the spot.

256
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:20,715
Nite owl murders, baby.

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,601
All right, okay, okay.

258
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:26,171
All kidding aside,
great job.

259
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:27,389
Thank you.

260
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:28,390
That's not
why I called you down here.

261
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,842
Look, Harvey,

262
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,778
you're killing it,
and you've been killing it,

263
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,512
and I think it's time
that you got rewarded for it.

264
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,114
Head litigator.

265
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,900
Look, I know you got a deal
with Jessica to come back,

266
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,986
but I'm telling you,
in ten years, you could be me.

267
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,071
You think about it.

268
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:46,491
In the meantime,
celebrate the win.

269
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,215
Just stay away
from my scotch.

270
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,635
Well, I guess
I win again.

271
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:59,221
You guys are really
behind the times.

272
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:00,705
You ought to be playing
hold'em.

273
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:02,207
Don't give a shit
about moneymaker

274
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,508
and his bullshit game.

275
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,010
We're old school.
We play stud.

276
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,377
You lose at stud.

277
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,396
Not to you, asshole.

278
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,683
No, no, no, no,
you lose to me.

279
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,736
Come on, hurry up, old school.
Deal the cards.

280
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,225
Compliments
of Cameron Dennis.

281
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,364
Harvey, this isn't
just winning a case.

282
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,250
This is head litigator.

283
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,501
Scotch isn't good enough.

284
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,402
We need, like, a ritual
or something.

285
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,205
What did you have in mind?

286
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,373
I don't know.

287
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:36,591
I have an idea.

288
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,376
I'm listening.

289
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:40,427
It's not something
a gentleman should say out loud.

290
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,848
Oh, well,
then I'm willing to pretend

291
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:45,383
that you're a gentleman.

292
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:52,274
Okay, you are definitely
not a gentleman.

293
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,643
What would we even
do it with?

294
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,094
Whipped cream.

295
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,597
Enough about
this conversation.

296
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,483
I want to revisit
our earlier one.

297
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,486
This is our earlier one.

298
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,239
Come on, you know
you've thought about it.

299
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,107
Yeah, I think
about a lot of things.

300
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,243
And you would.

301
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:13,712
But I won't.

302
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,280
You're afraid
you'd fall for me.

303
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,091
Oh, please, if anybody's
falling for anybody,

304
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,633
it would be you for me.

305
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:20,635
Sounds like a challenge.

306
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,304
One you are never
gonna get to take.

307
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,005
Why not?

308
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,341
'Cause I don't get involved
with men that I work with.

309
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,009
Okay, then you're fired.

310
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,460
'Bout time.

311
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:30,929
What did I ever
do to you?

312
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,431
Nothing.
I get your chair.

313
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,233
Bertha, what are you
doing here so late?

314
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,518
Don't get all up
in my business

315
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,853
just because I interrupted you
hitting on red.

316
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,605
How do you know
I'm hitting on her?

317
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,857
Two glasses of scotch
and you.

318
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,694
I found a Mackenzie file

You're welcome.

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,748
And you better get
Dennis his scotch back.

321
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:52,334
He won't like that.

322
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:53,818
Shit.

00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,036
What's wrong?

324
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,205
We left out
a piece of discovery.

325
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,290
Will it screw us?

326

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,661
Well, I raise.

500.

Call and raise
another 500.

I don't have
another 500, so...

another thousand?

I told you,
I got rid of it.

Now do you have this guy
or not?

and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>

341
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,693
The only way he beats me

342
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:37,362
is with trip 3s or trip 4s
under there,

343
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:39,164
and Limp Bizkit
folded two 3s,

344
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,750
and Dickcheese over here
had a 4.

- A straight.
- Straight.

347

Or he's bluffing,

I got him.

Oh, this guy.

Well, let's raise

Hmm.

gonna do about it?

You're not gonna get away
with this.

Well, I guess
your only option

365
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:30,465
would be
to call the police.

366

Of course,
I haven't been drinking,

all by yourself.

Yeah, well,

He did.
What do you want?

I can do to help.

Why does he have
to be offering me something?

offer them

Not telling them
shows them more.

walked a mile in his shoes.

I'm not going
to the batting cages,

from a drug dealer?

It's called consignment.

444
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,234
Did you ever learn about
free enterprise in Econ 1a?

445
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,119
No, but I read about
not betting money I don't have

446
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,287
in Econ 1a.

or Omar's gonna beat
the living shit outta me.

451
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:58,297
Trevor,
him kicking your ass

452
00:16:58,382 --> 00:16:59,966
doesn't get him
his money any faster.

453
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,250
He's not gonna
see it that way.

454
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,469
Okay, then we will think
of something else.

455
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,021
I've been thinking,

456
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,139
and the only thing
I came up with

457
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,274
you're not gonna like.

458
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:09,758
Why do I
have to like it?

459
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,396
Because I can't do it.

460
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,447
I told you before,

461
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,399
I'm not selling
any test answers.

462
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,600
It's not any test.
It's the test you just aced.

463
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:21,153
It's not out there yet.
Nobody has it.

464
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:24,657
I can make us 1,000 bucks
in one shot.

465
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:25,992
Tell me you haven't memorized

466
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:30,079
every question
and every answer, Harvard boy.

467
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,447
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

468
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:33,466
So what if it is?

469
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,583
Look, you're bolting,

470
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,118
and you're using
your brain to do it.

471
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:37,286
I'm just asking,

472
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:40,122
before you go,
use it to help me.

473
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,959
Please.

474
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,434
What the hell is this?

475
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,019
It's the paperwork
for the Mackenzie deal.

476
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,270
Type it up
and get it out.

477
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,238
No, that report was
supposed to be disclosed

478
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:57,323
during discovery.

479
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:58,991

what I gave you,

00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,826
you'd know
I'm disclosing it now.

481
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,145
No, you're sticking it
in there now

482
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,530
as if it's always been there.

483
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,332
It's called bluffing.

484
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,034
Okay, it's what I do.

485
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,618
That's how I got the confession
in the first place.

486
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,004
It's called bullshit,
it's what bullshitters do,

487
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,173
and it's how innocent people
sometimes end up in prison.

488
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:15,925
- Watch yourself.
- Excuse me?

489
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,793
That toxicology report
doesn't change the fact

490
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,512
that those two assholes
killed that woman.

491
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,963
And you being
an asshole to me

492
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,715
doesn't change the fact
that you are breaking the law.

493
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,216
I'm not breaking the law.

494
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,718
I put the goddamn thing
in there.

495
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,720
They can find it
if they can think to look.

496
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:30,172
Harvey,
you are making a huge--

497
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:32,341
That's enough!

498
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,226
I'm here.
You're here.

499
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,479
Do your job.

500
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,791
We know you have a witness.

501
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,242
Surprised it took you
that long.

502
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,577
And we know who it is.

503
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,080
The man from the video,
Colonel Mariga.

504
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,697
I don't have any prizes,

505
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:58,084
so you'll just have to accept
a pat on the back.

506
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,409
That's okay, Tom Selleck,
I don't need a pat on the back.

507
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,940
I just need to know
what bullshit story

508
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,172
he's gonna tell in court.

509
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:04,340
It's not bullshit.

510
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,591
He's gonna say
that Ava Hessington

511
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,009
paid him to kill
those people.

512
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,260
We're getting access
to him.

513
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,262
No, you're not,
because I'm gonna say

514
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,814
if she finds out
where he is,

515
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,682
what's to stop her
from killing him too?

516
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,051
You're not gonna bribe him,
you're not gonna threaten him,

517
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:17,520
and you're not gonna
talk him out of it,

518
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,606
because you're not gonna see him
until he gets on the stand.

519
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,525
But what I will do
is allow you

520
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,276
to take an offer
to your client.

521
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,112
15 years, no parole.

522
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,580
You're bluffing.

523
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,281
He's not gonna say she knew
about the murders,

524
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,567
because she didn't.

525
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,252
I'll tell you what.

526
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,455
Ten years with parole.

527
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,040
Ah, make it nine.

528
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:41,076
After all,
we used to work together.

529
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,237
- How'd it go?
- Don't.

530
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:54,800
Was she hot?

531
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,716
I sold her a math test
for $1,000.

532
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,967
I wasn't thinking
of whether she was hot or not.

533
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,618
Okay, I get it,
so, like, an eight?

534
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,454
No, a ten wouldn't even
do her justice.

535
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,056
- So six.
- Mm, she's a four.

536
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:05,308
But she paid me $1,000,
so I bumped her up to a ten.

537
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:06,459
Got it.

538
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,478
Thank you, Michael.
Came through.

539

Not yet.

I'm coming with you
to Omar's.

541
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:12,832
No, no, no, no,
you can't.

542
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,817
Yes, I can.

543
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,354
What's going on?

00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,772
I owed him the money
yesterday.

545
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,307
How could you not
tell me that?

546
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,076
Because I couldn't make the
test thing happen until today.

547
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,343
I didn't want you
freaking out.

548
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,745
Well, I'm definitely
coming with you now,

549
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:29,082

stop me is with that bat.

- It's the Mackenzie file--
- I know what it is.

553
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:39,325
What the hell did you put
in the fine print?

554
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,793
You too?

555
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:43,164
You're gonna give me shit about
not disclosing this report?

556
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,297
Not disclosing it?

557
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:46,299
You gave it to 'em
on a silver platter.

558
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,384
I don't understand.
You want me to take it out?

559
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,353
I don't want you to do shit.
I've already taken it out.

560
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,054
And if I'd wanted it disclosed,

561
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:53,856
I wouldn't have misfiled it
in the first place.

562
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:54,974
You buried it?

563
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,192
Damn right I did.

I'm all for skirting the law,

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,481
So was killing that woman,

567
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:03,349
and I'm not gonna let
those two assholes walk

568
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,352
because our eyewitness had
a few beers at the ball game.

569
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,187
They won't walk. That's why
I put it in the fine print.

570
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:10,039
You think you're the first guy
to have this idea?

571
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:11,991
Nobody does it
because it doesn't work.

572
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,493
Well, that's exactly
why it can work.

573
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:15,128
They won't think
to look at it

574
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,079
because nobody
has the balls to do it.

576

and these guys get out
and they murder your brother

577

I know that Cameron's
offered Harvey a deal.

All right, I'm not going
behind Harvey's back.

I don't want you
to go behind his back.

I want you to go
to his face.

And do what?

595
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,238
It wasn't a deal.
It was an insult.

596
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,573
It was an opening.

597
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:01,791
Now he wouldn't
have offered anything

598
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,209
if he wasn't willing
to negotiate.

599
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,378
Maybe we can get him
down to five years.

600
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:06,596
That's exactly
what he wants,

601
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,930
to put Ava
in a position

602
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,748
where she has to choose
between five years and life.

603
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,300
That's a better position
than she's in now.

604
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,946
He wouldn't have offered
anything at all

605
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,086
if he wasn't bluffing.

606
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,438
We're not gonna fall
for that bluff.

607
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:16,962
Well, then Harvey's
making a mistake.

608
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,891
Then take it up
with Harvey.

609
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,093
You know as well as I do
Harvey is not interested

in anything I've got to say
at the moment.

611
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:24,430
You think Harvey's
making this call

612
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,298
because of what's going on
between you and Donna?

613

- Not about this.

with respect to Cameron.

He can't hear reason
with respect to me.

617
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,013
Now you have a chance
to convince him
