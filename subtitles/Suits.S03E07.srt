1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,468
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,041
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow...

3
00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:06,252
And this is your way
of getting me on your side.

4
00:00:06,277 --> 00:00:08,278
I don't want you
on my side.

5
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:10,792
I want us to be
on the same side.

6
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:12,988
I get
Ava Hessington acquitted.

7
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:15,127
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,032
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

9
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,663
Get out of my sight.

10
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,428
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

11
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,901
You don't work my case
without me.

12
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,306
And since you seem to be
having trouble

13
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:26,612
understanding that,
you don't work my case at all.

14
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:28,518
You and Stephen.

15
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,647
It bothers me.

16
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,950
I didn't know
you're a cat man.

17
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,452
Do I have brains
in my head?

18
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:33,677
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

19
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,416
Who is this stunning creature?
Mikado.

20
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,082
The Hong Kong office
urgently requires me

21
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,352
for a few weeks.

22
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:41,255
I'm sure there is a suitable
luxury feline hotel.

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,454
- Don't play games, okay?
- So you'll do it?

24
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,022
Nyes.
Can I have her?

25
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:46,988
What do you want, Stephen?

26
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,824
I heard Cameron
got a witness.

27
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,990
He did?
What do you want?

28
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:51,991
I'm just checking to see
if there's anything

29
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:52,991
I can do to help.

30
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:54,728
- There isn't.
- No way.

31
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,296
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

32
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:57,569
you don't have him today.

33
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,198
Why don't you ask your friend
Stephen Huntley?

34
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,432
He's the one who led me
right to him.

35
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,607
You know, you might just be
the perfect man.

36
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,281
You're just coming
to realize that now?

37
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:17,283
Mmhmm.

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,360
Donna.

39
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:27,864
I need a minute alone
with Stephen.

40
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,268
Is it just a minute?
Or do I need to get a cab?

41
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,272
It won't take long.
But the rest is up to you.

42
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,191
Well, I'm guessing you're not
here to join us for dessert.

43
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:45,921
You called Colonel Mariga.

44
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:49,024
Yeah.
I called him.

45
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:51,255
Called him to find out what
Cameron Dennis had offered him

46
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,792
and to suggest
that he could do better.

47
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,097
You mean you called him
to offer him a bribe.

48
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,897
Doesn't matter.

49
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,971
Dennis was bluffing.

50
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,203
He never had him
in the first place.

51
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:03,107
He didn't
but he does now

52
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:05,508
because of you.

53
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,549
You're saying
he traced my call?

54
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,813
You're damn right I am.

55
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:10,655
And you're angry with <i>me?</i>

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
You're supposed to be
looking out for Ava.

57
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,793
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think

58
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:15,460
that you were working
for Cameron Dennis.

59
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,267
And by the way,
the man is in hiding.

60
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,498
His own country can't find him.
How the hell did you?

61
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:21,835
Same way you would.

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,907
You know people here.

63
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:25,106
I know people everywhere.

64
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,308
Well, calling those people
just screwed us.

65
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:29,877
I called them, Harvey,
because you were doing nothing.

66
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,718
I was doing nothing
because he had nothing.

67
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:34,213
And then I had the tape
thrown out

68
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:35,719
and he had less than nothing.

69
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:38,192
Then he threw a hail Mary
and you just caught it.

70
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,623
If he found Mariga
by tapping my phones,

71
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,157
the judge
will throw him out.

72
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,156
You think we're gonna be able
to prove

73
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,260
that that's how
he found him?

74
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:45,523
You wanna carry on
yelling at me?

75
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:47,166
Or should we fix this?

76
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,231
You know, I have had
about enough

77
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:49,464
of your fixer crap, okay?

78
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,969
You didn't fix shit.
You broke it wide open.

79
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,566
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

80
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm here to tell you
that if I hear your name

81
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,539
around my case again,

82
00:02:56,604 --> 00:03:01,376
I am gonna beat the shit
outta you.

83
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,618
You told him you were gonna
beat the shit out of him?

84
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,258
Yeah, and that's
the last time

85
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,627
I'm gonna tell him anything.

86
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,459
What?

87
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:13,898
You think I wouldn't
do it?

88
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,594
No, I'm not sure
you <i>could</i> do it.

89
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,131
What's he going
to hit me with, his ascot?

90
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,637
Harvey, the man plays rugby.
That's no joke.

91
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:21,006
How do you even
know that?

92
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,775
It's on the Darby
international website.

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,541
I don't give you
enough work.

94
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:26,109
And I'm gonna change that
right now.

95
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:29,044
Cameron's not denying us access
to Mariga,

96
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,380
which means he's gonna sing
any song Cameron wants

97
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,485
to avoid a firing squad--

98
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,888
So I need to find anything
I can

99
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,655
to take Mariga apart.

100
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,792
What the hell is this?

101
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,993
I'll tell you what it is.

102
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:40,225
It's a witness list
from Cameron Dennis

103
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:41,560
with Colonel Mariga on it.

104
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,928
And he's giving us access,

105
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,464
which means he's not bluffing.

106
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:45,569
I know.

107
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:46,666
You told me
he didn't have him.

108
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,740
He didn't.

109
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:49,005
Then how the hell
did he get him?

110
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,679
Stephen.
He was trying to fix it.

111
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,912
Are you telling me
you let Stephen Huntley

112
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,089
lead Cameron directly
to the star witness?

113
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,384
I didn't let Stephen
do shit.

114
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:59,753
He did it on his own.
He's your guy.

115
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,289
You aligned with him.
I did not.

116
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:02,857
Okay, he's Edward Darby's guy.

117
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,297
You made a deal
with Darby.

118
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:09,161
That makes him your guy.

119
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,801
You really wanna do this
right now?

120
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:14,669
Are you telling me
he doesn't know?

121
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,209
You know I know.

122
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,612
You and I had
this conversation once.

123
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,441
And you know
where my loyalties lie.

124
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:25,247
And as for your point,
Stephen is only here at all

125
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,917
because you made a deal
with Darby in the first place.

126
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:32,461
And I told you,
I don't want mine anymore.

127
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,029
Then I guess
I'm still in charge.

128
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,630
And since I've now been drafted
onto this case,

129
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:39,535
no one tells Edward Darby

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,705
or Stephen Huntley
a goddamn thing.

131
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,321

What'd you get me?

143
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:34,884
This isn't the first time
Mariga lied

144
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:35,624
to get out of prosecution.

145
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:36,720
Other murders?

146
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,529
Murder. Extortion.
Embezzlement.

147
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,824
You want someone
to commit a crime

148
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,625
and blame it on someone else,
he's your guy.

149
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,329
You got the questions
lined up?

150
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,802
Right here.

151
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:50,404
But I think you know
what my biggest question is.

152
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,644
What do you want me
to say?

153
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,880
I changed my mind about Darby.
I told Jessica.

154
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,216
And I didn't get a chance
to tell you

155
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,649
because we had bigger fish
to fry.

156
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,554
I understand why you didn't
get a chance to tell me.

157
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,218
What I don't get is
why you told her.

158
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,026
If I can't trust her
to get over it after I tell her,

159
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:05,762
I might as well have stuck
with Darby in the first place.

160
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,395
Doesn't look like
she's over it.

161
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,164
Because she knows
what we know.

162
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:13,101
Right now,
we got bigger fish to fry.

163
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:29,226
Are you kidding me?

164
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,427
Norma?

165
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,102
I've told you a million
goddamn times.

166
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,639
2% of Mikado's afternoon milk.

167
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:34,985
She's gonna taste
the extra skim.

168
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,777
And who do you think
she's gonna take it out on?

169
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,707
Me.

170
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,844
Oh, and find out
what the holdup is

171
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,415
on my trademark claim
on "Litt Up."

172
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:43,354
Nigel, you're back a week early.

173
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:44,923
I was gonna holiday
an extra week.

174
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:47,061
But I was rejuvenated
after only two days

175
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:49,999
in the native clays
at Guangzhou.

176
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,305
You're glowing.

177
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,277
And I can't wait
to see Mikado.

178
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:56,016
The lovely lass is here,
I see.

179
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,386
Uh, no, she's not here.

180
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,323
Then who's that for?

181
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,628
That's for me.

182
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,303
It's my afternoon milk.

183
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:18,056
Hits the spot.
Gotta run.

184
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,753
Louis.

185
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,856
Where is she?

186
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,528
At the best cat spa
in the city,

187
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,329
getting her nails buffed
and her paws polished.

188
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:26,962
You spoil her.

189
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,171
- She spoils me.
- Call me when she's back.

190
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,173
I will.

191
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,950
Rachel, Louis.
Code Red.

192
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,926
Did anybody see you
leave my office?

193
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,054
- Norma gave me a look.
- She's on our side.

194
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,359
Rachel, concentrate.

195
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,631
I don't even know
if I'm on your side.

196
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,865
This isn't right.
She wants to be my cat.

197
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,098
No.
You want her to be your cat.

198
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,602
You don't understand.

199
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,277
This past week has been the best
week of my life, ever since--

200
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:16,446
Bruno, I understand.

201
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,281
But you can't keep Mikado.

202
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,586
She's Nigel's cat.

203
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,020
- Well said.
- Ah, Nigel, how did you--

204
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,526
By doing what any
self-respecting cat owner

205
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:27,633
would do:
Equipping her with an RFID.

206
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:30,107
A radio-frequency-identifier
integrated circuit.

207
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,436
Why would you hide
my prize possession?

208
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,173
Is that what she is to you?
A possession?

209
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:39,182
What she is to me
is between me and her.

210
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:44,358
You're right.

211
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:47,903
He's right.

212
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:51,475
I'm sorry.

213
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,615
I'm not ready.
Louis.

214
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,091
He was supposed to be gone
for two weeks.

215
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,517
We had a verbal contract I would
have custody for two weeks.

216
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,260
It was
a baby-sitting arrangement.

217
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,365
One that I was
mentally, emotionally,

218
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,551
and physically prepared for.

219
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,047
And accordingly,
I am legally entitled

220
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,505
to Mikado
for one more week.

221
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,937
That is not the law.

222
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,039
There's actually precedent.

223
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:14,913
Warminsky v. Mitchell, 1974.

224
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,916
I have a meeting,

225
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:21,922
after which I will collect
what is rightfully mine.

226
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:29,866
- That was genius.
- No, Louis.

227
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:31,705
That was a stall

228
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,537
because the truth is
Nigel's right.

229
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,582
She's not your cat.

230
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,088
You've gotta let her go.

231
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:42,186
Hey, do you wanna talk
about last night?

232
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:43,626
No, Donna, I don't.

233
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,858
Harvey, you said my being
with Stephen bothered you.

234
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,212
And I just wanna
make sure that--

235
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,300
That what he did deserved
interrupting your date?

236
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:51,300
- Did it?
- I don't know, Donna.

237
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:52,469
You tell me.

238
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,299
I mean, we had this entire case
locked up.

239
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:56,006
I mean, your boyfriend
gave Cameron

240
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,742
a Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card

241
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,576
after I told him to stay
the hell out of it.

242
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,584
What'd he do?

243
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,051
He tracked down Mariga

244
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,356
and led Cameron
right to him.

245
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,694
- Harvey, I'm--
- You know what?

246
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,758
Instead of discussing Stephen
shit-ing the bed,

247
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:09,862
right now,
I have to try to clean it up.

248
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,984
Gwambaa.

249
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,046
Makaiwa.

250
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,582
Port Eefa.

251
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,950
40 people killed.

252
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,855
Are you here to answer
questions or ask them?

253
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,287
Are you familiar
with these photos?

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm responsible
for these photos.

255
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,221
You seem proud of yourself.

256
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,828
I am a military man
in a violent country.

257
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,061
I do what needs to be done.

258
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,535
That doesn't make me
a murderer.

259
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,034
Because you kill people

260
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,305
under orders
from your government.

261
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,369
Precisely.

262
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,408
Isn't that exactly
what you did

263
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,839
on Hessington Oil's land?

264
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,639
No, I killed those people

265
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,681
because I was paid
by your client.

266
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,211
Well, that <i>does</i> make you
a murderer.

267
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,218
And you're only saying
that Ava knew about it

268
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,883
because your precious government

269
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,080
is no longer in power
to protect you.

270
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,318
That is not true.

271
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:56,783
And what exactly is
the penalty

272
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,919
if you're found guilty of murder
in your country?

273
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,289
Death.

274
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:02,562
And why is it you haven't
been sent back there?

275
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,834
I'll take this one.
He cut a deal with me.

276
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,065
Because I care more about
the person who ordered this

277
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,403
than the person
who carried it out.

278
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,468
There's only one problem.

279
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,311
He only met with Ava once.

280
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:14,048
And your only proof
of that meeting is inadmissible.

281
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,343
Wrong.

282
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,518
He didn't only talk
to Ava once.

283
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,655
I told your client
about what needed to be done

284
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,056
when we spoke
on the phone.

285
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,858
Ah.

286
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,429
Ms. Hessington didn't tell you
about that.

287
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:31,569
She didn't tell us about that
because that never happened.

288
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:32,724
What'd you expect her
to do?

289
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,979
Come to you
and say "I did it?"

290
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:39,381
A record of the call
from Ava's private, secure line.

291
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,515
A call in which we discussed
the impediments

292
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:42,618
to the pipeline,

293
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,851
the six leaders
who stood in its way,

294
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,496
and the cost
for their removal.

295
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:50,698
$3 million,
which she admitted paying

296
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,941
in the admission
you had her sign.

297
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:57,010
I don't need the tape because
I have everything I need,

298
00:11:57,075 --> 00:12:00,011
including the fact that she lied
about that phone call.

299
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,366
Hey.

300
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,468
What happened to you
last night?

301
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,099
I think you know
what happened.

302
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,370
I saw you two yelling
at each other

303
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,067
and I didn't want any part
of it.

304
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,710
Well, believe me, I didn't
want any part of it either.

305
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,048
Well, what did you think
he was gonna do

306
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,849
when he found out
you screwed up his case?

307
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:26,519
I think you know that I wasn't
trying to screw it up.

308
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,750
But you did.

309
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,950
And he specifically told you
to stay away.

310
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:32,318
And you told me not
to discuss you with him.

311
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,488
So why are you discussing him
with me?

312
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,664
Because I have a relationship
with him

313
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,330
that's a lot longer
than a few weeks.

314
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:40,370
And when you mess with him,
you mess with me.

315
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,738
Donna, I wasn't trying
to mess with him.

316
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,905
I was trying to help him.

317
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,569
And as long as we're on
the subject,

318
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,644
I'm sure he mentioned if
it wasn't for my previous help,

319
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,508
he wouldn't still have Ava
as a client.

320
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:54,081
You know, he might've
mentioned something about that.

321
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:58,311
Then can we get back
to not discussing him?

322
00:12:58,384 --> 00:12:59,888
As long as you promise
not to do anything

323
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:03,920
to make us not discuss him
ever again.

324
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,564
I promise.

325
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,766
Good boy.

326
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,365
I'm gonna ask you once.

327
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,806
Is he telling
the truth?

328
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,239
Yes.

329
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:17,775
We had a conversation
on the phone

330
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,247
but not about murder.

331
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:23,749
You didn't think we needed
to know?

332
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,284
I didn't remember.

333
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:27,316
That lie won't play well
in court.

334
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,620
I told you about
the meeting.

335
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,516
I didn't think to tell you
about the call

336
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:31,652
where we agreed to meet.

337
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,154
That's all it was.

338
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,857
When? Where?
How much money?

339
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:37,028
Not even that.
That was settled beforehand.

340
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,289
It was a formality
Nick arranged.

341
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,288
Nick Howell?
Your former protege?

342
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,929
He dealt with these people.
He knew what's expected.

343
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:46,296
It was a social nicety
so insignificant,

344
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,896
I didn't remember
until you brought it up.

345
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,171
They brought it up.

346
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,444
And now, they're gonna point out
that you didn't.

347
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,011
I understand
it looks bad.

348
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,946
But Edward said that this man
is a murderer.

349
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,074
And there's no need for me
to be concerned--

350
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:58,914
Edward Darby says
a lot of things

351
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,777
you want to believe
but shouldn't.

352
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,680
You don't believe me.

353
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:03,848
Hiding a conversation

354
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,313
and then coming clean
about it later

355
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,925
tends to get in the way
of trust.

356
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,929
- Jessica--
- It makes you disingenuous.

357
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:12,329
It makes you look guilty.

358
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:13,735
I'm not.

359
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,229
Do you find that people
usually kill your enemies

360
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,566
for you without your asking?

361
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,504
- Jessica.
- Ava, you'll have to excuse us.

362
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,745
We have to come up
with another plan

363
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,824
because the one we had
just went to shit.

364
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:41,354
I can't help but notice
you've come empty-handed.

365
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:45,658
Not exactly.

366
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:55,667
You're suing me for ownership
of Mikado.

367
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:56,901
On what grounds?

368
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,502
On the grounds that I provide
a better home

369
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,341
because you're constantly flying
around the world.

370
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,237
Mary Poppins doesn't
get custody

371
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,709
of the children
in her care.

372
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,311
The Von Trapp children
fell in love with Maria.

373
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:08,552
She became their mother.
Because their mother was dead.

374
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,185
There's no legal basis
for this.

375
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,290
You're confident
in that fact?

376
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:13,356
Most assuredly.

377
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,029
Then let's put it
to our own jury.

378
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:18,901
You're suggesting
a mock trial.

379
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,038
You get to prove you're
the better man

380
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,072
in front
of our associates.

381
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,473
You agree to hand her back
the moment the verdict is in?

382
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:25,610
I agree to let you say
good-bye to her

383
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,715
the moment
that you're defeated.

384
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:35,758
Whatever the hell
that means.

385
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,899
Glad to see you haven't lost
your touch with the clients.

386
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,163
I don't have to be
nice to her.

387
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,003
I just have to clean up
after her bullshit.

388
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,066
She didn't lie.
She just made a mistake.

389
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,872
We still have
to clean it up.

390
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,535
And she just handed us
a road map.

391
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:48,172
You wanna go after
Nick Howell.

392
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:49,941
He's reasonable doubt
staring us right in the face.

393
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:51,711
It's a bad idea.

394
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,711
He admitted to the bribe,
he set up the call,

395
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:55,616
and he was her man
on the ground.

396
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,081
Laying it on Nick
would be admitting

397
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,620
Hessington Oil paid Mariga
to kill those people.

398
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,726
We already admitted
that Ava paid him.

399
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,597
And Mariga already admitted
to the murders.

400
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,523
This is exactly why
we should stick to the plan

401
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,427
to destroy Mariga's testimony.

402
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Not wanting to be shot

403
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,196
is a hell of an incentive
to lie.

404
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,964
And an easy thing for a jury
to understand.

405
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,571
Let me spell this out
for you.

406
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:17,340
You don't just show
that your client didn't do it

407
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,211
when you can point to someone
who did.

408
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,874
But you're never gonna
convince a jury

409
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,612
the number one didn't know
what the number two was up to.

410
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,285
You have the balls
to say that to me?

411
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,453
I'm not saying--

412
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,756
I don't care
what you're saying.

413
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,621
I'm the one in charge
of this case.

414
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:34,095
And believe me,
I can convince anyone

415
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,832
of the fact
that a number two

416
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:40,401
can betray a number one
behind her back.

417
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,601
Out.

418
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:59,810
- You still hiding from Nigel?
- What?

419
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:00,793
No, I'm looking
for Katrina.

420
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:04,499
She just left
for Barcelona.

421
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,308
Sorry? She what?

422
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,043
The training program.

423
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:12,346
- Nesbitt.
- Why would he send her away?

424
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,611
Because he knew I'd pick her
to represent me

425
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,042
at Mikado's custody hearing.

426
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,778
You're suing for custody?
Louis, that's insane.

427
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,914
- Rachel, he abandoned her.
- He went on a business trip.

428
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,387
- Okay, whose side are you on?
- Yours.

429
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:22,923
But the law is not
with you.

430
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:23,924
What, you think
when you become a lawyer,

431
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,070
you're gonna be
trying cases

432
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:25,955
where the law
is always on your side?

433
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,027
- Louis.
- Rachel.

434
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,258
You need to tell me
which associate

435
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:31,730
is least loyal
to Nigel now.

436
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:32,933
- Kaufman.
- No, too green.

437
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,101
Corcoran.

438
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,406
The guy owned a hamster
as a child.

439
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,374
He'll view a cat
as a predator.

440
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,439
- Donahue?
- D-D-D-D-D-Donahue?

441
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,432
I'll not only lose custody,
I may end up in jail.

442
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:44,583
- For what?
- Rachel, I stole the man's cat.

443
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,680
And I need someone
who understands why.

444
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:49,382
Then who, Louis?

445
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:55,924
You.

446
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,427
- I'm not a lawyer, Louis.
- You're gonna be soon enough.

447
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,192
You run circles around
those clowns.

448
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:03,758
And Nigel holds no sway
over you.

449
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,233
Okay.

450
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:09,236
You are asking me to help you
steal Nigel's cat.

451
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:15,051
Rachel, you know how tough
it's been for me this year.

452
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:17,516
I lost the associates.

453
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:20,557
Mike made a fool of me.

454
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,224
I saw Harvey's name go up
on the wall.

455
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:25,030
And I went home.

456
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,503
But you know
what happened?

457
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:29,999
Mikado saw my pain.

458
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,208
And she brought me
a mouse.

459
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,975
Louis, we have a murder trial
going on.

460
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:43,984
A trial that I have nothing
to do with.

461
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:51,262
Rachel, I love her.

462
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,536
Now, I once fought valiantly
for your dream.

463
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:57,606
And even though I lost...

464
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:03,983
I'm asking you.

465
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,992
Fight for mine?

466
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,727
Jessica!

467
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,128
You have something for me
on Nick Howell?

468
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,600
Nick Howell
didn't do this.

469
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:17,865
Yeah, what the hell does
that have to do with anything?

470
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,537
Look, Harvey's problem
with going after Nick

471
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,442
is that it might backfire
on Ava, right?

472
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:22,874
But even if it doesn't,
we're still putting

473
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,301
an innocent man
in the cross hairs.

474
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,178
An innocent man.

475
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:28,013
He sold out Ava the second
he had a chance.

476
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:29,686
And I sat there
and watched him do it.

477
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,232
Cameron had him backed
against a wall.

478
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,449
He just did what he had
to do.

479
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:33,888
And now, we're backed up
against a wall.

480
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,892
And I don't give a shit
about Ava's number two.

481
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,693
He can rot in hell
for all I care.

482
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:43,634
I just have
one question.

483
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:47,771
Are you going after him
because he tried to sell Ava out

484
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:51,716
or because Harvey
tried to sell you out?

485
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,014
What did you just say
to me?

486
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:54,951
I just wanna make sure
we're not potentially

487
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:56,151
throwing a man's
life away

488
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:59,763
just because you're mad
at someone else.

489
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,459
Instead of you coming
down here

490
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,796
and telling me
who to be mad at,

491
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,438
why don't you do
your job?

492
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,106
And find out what the hell
Cameron has on Nick Howell

493
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,454
that had him turn on Ava
in the first place

494
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,951
because if you think all it was
was that tape,

495
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:17,962
then you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

496
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:31,020
They wanna talk settlement
and they sent you?

497
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,891
No, they didn't.

498
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,996
So you're going rogue?
Bullshit.

499
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:37,292
I don't buy it--
You can buy whatever you want.

500
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:39,060
The fact is you, Harvey,
and Jessica

501
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,501
are so busy trying
to beat each other,

502
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,639
you can't see you all have
your heads up your asses.

503
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:44,703
Cocky, I get it.
Harvey taught you well.

504
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,639
No, what Harvey taught me
is to help my client.

505
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,113
Now, look.

506
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:51,987
I can't guarantee you
that we'll agree to anything.

507
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,421
But Ava deserves
an offer.

508
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,360
I spelled out my offer
a week ago.

509
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,896
Yeah, an offer based on
a bluff.

510
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,161
Huh, now,
I've got the real deal.

511
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,466
It was 9.
Now, it's 12.

512
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,706
Your real deal is
a confessed murderer

513
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,140
and a vindictive ex-employee.

514
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:07,678
I've got one saying
that Ava paid for it.

515
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:10,911
And another saying she knew
what she was paying for.

516
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,920
Great, then get me
a goddamn offer under nine,

517
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:13,953
and I'll get you
a deal.

518
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,356
This negotiation
is over, Junior.

519
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,893
Take your ball
and go home.

520
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,862
You really are a dick.

521
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,199
- What did you say?
- I said you're a dick.

522
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,702
And you can take your offer
and shove it up your ass.

523
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,414
I am so sorry.
You little piss ant.

524
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,415
I can't believe
this shit.

525
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,183
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

526
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,582
You know, I could have
you locked up

527
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,781
for assault right now?

528
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:40,820
Yeah, I'm sorry.

529
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,283
You know, I just--
I lost my head.

530
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:45,222
Please.

531
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:46,759
I-I was just trying
to do my job.

532
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:50,601
Take your mediation and get
the hell out of my office.

533
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,469
Yes, sir.

534
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,969
Mr. Litt,
how would you describe

535
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,514
Mikado's well-being
when she came under your care?

536
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,219
Well, Mikado's physical needs
were taken care of.

537
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,021
But there's more to a cat
than its physical condition.

538
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,285
They're highly
emotional creatures.

539
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,158
And were her emotional needs
tended to?

540
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,560
Calls for speculation.
He's not the cat whisperer.

541
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,330
He can't testify
to Mikado's thoughts,

542
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,500
which you should've
objected to.

543
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:20,607
- Sorry, sir.
- Very well.

544
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,545
Mr. Litt,
without speaking for Mikado,

545
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,617
would you describe
for the court

546
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:27,320
her emotional condition?

547
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:29,617
When Mikado first entered
my home,

548
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,525
she was aloof
and standoffish.

549
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,095
She's a cat.

550
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:35,898
Sorry.
I'll wait my turn.

551
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,200
She was listless,
you know?

552
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,735
Like, I would take her out
to see a bird

553
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,240
or a dog.

554
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:45,285
And there'd just
be nothing.

555
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,551
You know what I think?
Hm?

556
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,787
I think that she was
the victim of neglect

557
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:50,427
due to the absence
of a consistent father figure

558
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:51,563
because he's traveling
all the time.

559
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,100
- I object.
- To what?

560
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,565
To you letting him talk
about my cat that way.

561
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,470
You changed the rules
to get Ms. Zane.

562
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:00,579
I'm changing the rules.
I'm gonna represent myself.

563
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:01,685
- But--
- You're dismissed.

564
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,521
Getting hot in here, Nesbitt?

565
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,091
Mr. Litt, I'll ask you
not to address

566
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,698
the defendant directly.

567
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:13,467
I'm not the defendant.

568
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:15,204
This isn't
a criminal trial.

569
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,940
Well, it should be.

570
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:18,174
Where were we?

571
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,281
You were describing
the deplorable condition

572
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,284
in which you found
Mr. Nesbitt's cat.

573
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:25,588
Oh, yeah.

574
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:28,191
Jessica, I've been expecting
your call.

575
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,931
You aren't expecting
<i>this</i> call.

576
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,669
It was pointed out
to me

577
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,869
that I had misplaced
some of my anger.

578
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,773
So I've decided to place
some of it on you.

579
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:37,510
Then this is the call
I was expecting.

580
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,879
You've heard about Stephen?
I heard about you.

581
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:41,709
And your deal
with Harvey.

582
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,278
I was wondering
when you'd find out.

583
00:23:44,316 --> 00:23:45,746
Save it.

584
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,143
I thought when I got rid
of Daniel Hardman,

585
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,015
I was done with partners
I couldn't trust.

586
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,583
I assume you're referring
to Harvey

587
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:53,183
because I'm not the one
who proposed that deal.

588
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,116
Him asking isn't the same
as you accepting.

589
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:57,684
No, it isn't,
but he was going to quit

590
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:58,682
because of you.

591
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,415
And that deal
made him stay.

592
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,284
And as you said yourself,
he is essential to the firm.

593
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:05,052
Not more essential
than me.

594
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:07,052
And as for your deal
with Harvey,

595
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,789
it doesn't exist because
he doesn't want it anymore.

596
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,261
Which was my hope
from the beginning.

597
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,094
You are a saint,
aren't you?

598
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,906
I'm not sure
I fully understand

599
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,435
the purpose of this call.

600
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,972
I want
Stephen Huntley gone.

601
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:21,782
I won't allow him to do
any more damage.

602
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:25,080
When you have a problem,
you turn to Harvey.

603
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,921
Stephen fills that role
for me.

604
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,889
You want him gone?
Win the case.

605
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:31,856
He'll be on the next
flight out.

606
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:35,627
Edward, Harvey and I
are going to win this case.

607
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,668
And then you and I are going
to have a conversation

608
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:41,706
about the future
of this merger.

609
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,170
Ah, now I understand.

610
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,410
What?

611
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,874
By telling you about my part
in his deal,

612
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:49,842
he's turned you
against the very merger

613
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,911
he never wanted
in the first place.

614
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:54,141
Harvey had nothing to do
with this.

615
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:56,949
Hadn't he?

616
00:24:57,014 --> 00:25:01,487
Goodbye, Edward.

617
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,160
You have portrayed yourself

618
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:14,336
as the kindhearted savior

619
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:16,768
of this feline soul.

620
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:18,809
Is that correct?
Yeah.

621
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,555
I believe I've brought out
the best in her.

622
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,378
So you have a way
with your charges?

623
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:25,921
A velvet glove,
so to speak?

624
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:27,587
I guess you could say
I'm built that way.

625
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:29,396
So you're a good parent?

626
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,395
Um, a role model?

627
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,464
No one could
say otherwise.

628
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,934
So if one of your charges
were to say you were hostile,

629
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:41,346
cruel, prone to kicking
the proverbial dog,

630
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,714
would that be a lie?

631
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,112
My treatment of felines is
what's of issue here.

632
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:46,752
I thought it was
your parenting skills,

633
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,298
your ability to mold
and shape gently.

634
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:49,649
But that's not--

635
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:52,592
This jury knows all about
your parenting skills,

636
00:25:52,657 --> 00:25:55,222
which involve
berating, belittling,

637
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,192
screaming, sadism--

638
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,825
Objection!

639
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:00,266
You can object
all you like.

640
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:04,834
But as I said,
this jury knows

641
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:07,936
that that man is not
what he portrays himself to be.

642
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,368
And what about you?

643
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,040
You think molding and shaping
is accomplished

644
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,511
by abandoning your charges

645
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:13,943
and sending
the occasional memo

646
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,311
while you're off mudding
in the Yangtze?

647
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:18,665
I'd like to call
my next witness.

648
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:19,680
Oh, really?
What witness?

649
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:21,119
You didn't declare
a witness.

650
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:23,457
He's a hostile witness.

651
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:26,492
And I'm afraid he's hostile
to you.

652
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,828
I call Harold Gunderson
to the stand.

653
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:35,803
Holy shit.
We're in trouble.

654
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,709
We need
a ten-minute recess.

655
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,077
Ah, uh, no, no, Rachel,
I'm sorry,

656
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:44,380
but I can't talk
right now.

657
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,714
I am typing up Cameron's files
from memory.

658
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,050
Mike, I am going to lose
my first case...

659
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:50,284
- Uh-huh.
- A mock case...

660
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,193
- Okay.
- About a cat.

661
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:57,234
Okay, that,
I have a couple of minutes for.

662
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:59,197
Nigel dug up Harold.

663
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:00,597
What? He's gonna throw Louis
under the bus.

664
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,597
Which is why I need
your help.

665
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,700
I need you to remember

666
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:04,564
anything good he said
about Louis.

667
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:06,668
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

668
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,069
You were just referring
to your amazing memory.

669
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:09,615
No, it's not
that I can't remember it.

670
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,013
It's that he never said
anything good.

671
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,317
Oh, my God.
I'm screwed.

672
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,717
I'm so sorry, Rachel,
but I have to go.

673
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:16,284
What? Are you kidding?
You've got--you've got nothing?

674
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,956
What I have is complete faith
in you.

675
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:19,523
So say hi to Harold
for me

676
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:22,457
before you figure out a way
to screw him.

677
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,027
Huh.

678
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:31,400
Jessica was right.
There's dirt on Nick.

679
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:32,433
Where'd you get this?

680
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:33,899
It's courtesy
of Cameron Dennis.

681
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:35,604
I actually went in there--
Holy shit.

682
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,637
I know, there's enough there
to point the finger at him.

683
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,878
There's enough here to make me
think that he really did it.

684
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,616
So what do
you wanna do?

685
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:42,681
Go tell Jessica
she was right

686
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:44,034
and then get Nick Howell
in here.

687
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:45,053
And make sure he doesn't have
an answer for this

688
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,060
before we get to court.

689
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,060
On it.

690
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,429
Mr. Gunderson,
you are currently

691
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,384
an associate at Bratton Gould.

692
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:58,323
At what firm
did you previously work?

693
00:27:58,388 --> 00:27:59,596
I worked here.

694
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,925
And who was
your supervisor?

695
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,596
That man, Louis Litt.

696
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:04,797
Really, Harold?

697
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,597
Let the record show
that Mr. Gunderson

698
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,637
indicated Mr. Litt.

699
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:12,142
Tell me about
Mr. Litt's guidance.

700
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,008
Louis believes
in teaching by fear.

701
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:15,514
Your Honor, I'd just like
to state for the record

702
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,860
that the witness is speaking
into an imaginary microphone.

703
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:19,357
You're speaking into
an imaginary microphone.

704
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:20,621
- That's what I mean.
- You know what?

705
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:21,822
Fine, I'm done.
Proceed.

706
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:25,096
Would you characterize him
as a-a screamer?

707
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,001
A tyrant?
Petty and vindictive?

708
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,507
All of the above.

709
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:33,785
He didn't try to gently sculpt
your future like blown glass?

710
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,357
He called me an idiot,
an imbecile,

711
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,558
and an embarrassment
to the legal profession.

712
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:39,894
That sounds harsh.

713
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:42,160
My therapist says
that I have scars on my psyche.

714
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,137
- Hearsay.
- I could call said therapist.

715
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,465
Oh, that'd be lovely,

716
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,274
except it still has nothing
to do with the cat.

717
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,876
Uh, bear with me.
I'm getting there.

718
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:54,483
Uh, tell me about Bruno.

719
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,324
He was Louis' cat.

720
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,325
I was made to take care
of him.

721
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:03,503
- He didn't do it himself?
- No.

722
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,200
Do you like cats, Harold?

723
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:07,568
No.

724
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:09,304
I'm allergic.

725
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:10,543
I don't even know
what to do with them.

726
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:13,846
But he left this cat,
his cat,

727
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:15,577
in your care?

728
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,746
What happened?
Hey, you know what?

729
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,220
This would be a good time
to object.

730
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,522
I can't, Louis, it's a valid
line of questioning.

731
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:24,427
What happened,
Mr. Gunderson?

732
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:26,799
He died a day later.

733
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:29,935
And what did he say to you
prior to that day?

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,501
He said he might as well
have left his cat

735
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:33,733
with Michael Vick.

736
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:44,586
I didn't realize
she'd be here.

737
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,659
Didn't want to look me
in the eye?

738
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:47,923
Ava, I'm sorry.

739
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,996
I'm glad I can help you
as a character witness.

740
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:51,629
I had no idea admitting
to the bribe

741
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:52,702
would lead
to this nonsense.

742
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,273
Solicitation of murder
is nonsense?

743
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:57,538
You know what I meant,
that Ava would never do that.

744
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,812
Oh, we agree.
We don't think she would.

745
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:02,516
We think you would.

746
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,252
What? You're trying
to blame the murders on me?

747
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,187
You met with Mariga
before Ava did.

748
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,587
You made the arrangements.
You agreed on the payments.

749
00:30:08,652 --> 00:30:10,220
You know all this.

750
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,187
But we didn't
know this.

751
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,628
Mr. Howell is being shown
a record of deposits

752
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,429
into a numbered
Swiss bank account

753
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:18,398
opened one week
after the murders.

754
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,199
- How did you get this?
- Are you saying it's not yours?

755
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:21,201
It's not what it seems.

756
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:22,872
Then tell us
what it is

757
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,577
because what it looks like
is a split of the take.

758
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,179
How much did Mariga
cut you in for?

759
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,286
- These are bonuses.
- Bonuses?

760
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,455
Part of my deal,

761
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,025
incentive payments
for getting the job done

762
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,394
under hardship conditions.

763
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,931
The only hardship you had
was finding someone

764
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:36,267
to kill those people.

765
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:39,132
You split the take with Mariga
then hid your share.

766
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,973
This money didn't come
from Colonel Mariga.

767
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:43,406
It came from Hessington Oil
and she knows it.

768
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,206
You can't keep pointing
the finger at Ava.

769
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,577
You acted alone on this.

770
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,987
I have emails
asking for her authorization

771
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:50,419
to make bonus payments.

772
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:53,387
Those emails didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts.

773
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,228
Because I knew you wouldn't
want them to.

774
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:56,524
Bullshit.

775
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:58,293
It didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts

776
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,932
because you went to Mariga
and arranged everything.

777
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,236
I didn't even
know Mariga.

778
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:05,500
He came to me.
He laid out a bribe.

779
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,838
I accepted it.
And Ava knew everything I did.

780
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:09,439
- That's a lie.
- She knew.

781
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,248
She just didn't know
the specifics.

782
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,680
And now, you're acting
like this means

783
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,312
that I ordered the killing
of those people.

784
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:17,289
Well, I didn't.

785
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:18,686
And if you try to make it look
like I did

786
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,885
without her knowledge,
no jury's ever going

787
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,252
to believe it
because it's not true.

788
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:33,962
Mr. Gunderson,
your tenure at this law firm

789
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,728
wasn't very successful,
was it?

790
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,160
I worked very hard.

791
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,731
Is it true that you once
failed to deliver

792
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,301
a motion to the court
because you thought

793
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:42,015
they were closed
due to inclement weather?

794
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,711
Someone told me
that it was a snow day.

795
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,113
Did you ever give
opposing counsel

796
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:46,648
a copy
of our trial strategy?

797
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,114
I thought it was part
of disclosure.

798
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,385
Did you leave a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

799
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,154
nearly costing
the client $900,000?

800
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:57,626
No one was supposed to know
about that.

801
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,930
Because Louis covered
for you.

802
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:01,499
- He berated me.
- No.

803
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:02,731
He kept it private.

804
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,437
And he allowed you to go back
and fix it.

805
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,712
Did he not?
He did.

806
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:08,378
Which allowed you to learn
from your mistakes.

807
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:10,378
Did it not?
I guess.

808
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,050
You testified that you now
work at Bratton Gould.

809
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,386
Is that correct?
Yes.

810
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:14,618
And when
they hired you,

811
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,691
did they know you'd been trained
by Louis Litt?

812
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:17,926
It came up.

813
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:20,095
So they knew
that you were nurtured by Louis.

814
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:21,495
They hired you.

815
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:25,840
And now,
are you happy?

816
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:26,842
Yes.

817
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:28,274
So with Louis' nurturance,

818
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,981
your mistakes were covered,

819
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:31,642
you landed another job,

820
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,642
and you're happy.

821
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:34,408
Isn't that correct?

822
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,745
But he was mean
to me.

823
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:37,882
No, this isn't about how
he treated you, Harold.

824
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:41,121
This is about how he treated
his cat.

825
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:43,891
And isn't the truth
that he loved that cat

826
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:48,599
and cared for him
with all of his heart?

827
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,670
Harold, you're under oath.
No, I'm not.

828
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:57,207
Harold.

829
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,342
Yes, he loved Bruno
with all of his heart.

830
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:09,122
I have
no further questions.

831
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:24,742
Hey.

832
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:28,017
What a lovely surprise.
And I come bearing gifts.

833
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:29,019
Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

834
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,388
Oh, well,
it's only right.

835
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:31,988
You've given me
so many things.

836
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,797
And I've never
given you anything.

837
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:37,199
Well, anything like this.

838
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:39,199
What is it?

839
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:42,008
I'm surprised
you don't recognize it.

840
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:45,913
It's a copy
of Colonel Mariga's deposition.

841
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:48,346
My copy count didn't reconcile
with the machine.

842
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:50,778
It was off
by seven pages,

843
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:55,252
the exact amount of that.

844
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,029
You thought
I wouldn't notice.

845
00:33:58,094 --> 00:33:59,959
I would.

846
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,336
- You spied on me.
- Oh, no.

847
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:02,833
I trusted you.

848
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,971
- Donna...
- Don't Donna me.

849
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:08,542
You looked me in the face
and you made me a promise.

850
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:10,215
I also made a promise
to Edward Darby.

851
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,951
And I made a promise
to Harvey.

852
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,152
And I wouldn't make
another one

853
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,786
if I knew I could only
keep one.

854
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,165
So you're choosing
what you don't have with him

855
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,792
over something that you do have
with me?

856
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:21,636
This has nothing to do
with him.

857
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,844
I don't care if you said
you'd stay out

858
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,045
of Norma's business
and you went back on it.

859
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,551
You lied to me.

860
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:32,586
We're done.

861
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,891
Oh.

862
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:37,230
And by the way,
you're welcome.

863
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:38,366
For what?

864
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,970
For not telling Harvey
about this.

865
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,107
Because if he found out,

866
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,580
he would beat the shit
outta you.

867
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,721
Watch what you're doing.

868
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:55,098
I wasn't actually moving.

869
00:34:55,163 --> 00:34:57,796
Yeah, well,
I don't actually care.

870
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,703
- Donna, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

871
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,176
Hey, Donna.

872
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:03,074
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

873
00:35:03,147 --> 00:35:04,810
You'll tell Harvey.
He'll get furious--

874
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:05,914
I won't tell Harvey.

875
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,314
Yeah, another promise.

876
00:35:07,387 --> 00:35:10,419
Donna.

877
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,991
He just couldn't keep his nose
out of it.

878
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:15,202
Who couldn't keep his nose
out of what?

879
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:19,603
Stephen got
Mariga's deposition.

880
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:20,602
You know what?

881
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:22,772
It doesn't matter.

882
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:25,047
I'm done with him anyway.

883
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:26,618
I'm so sorry.

884
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:38,019
Rachel that was amazing.

885
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,714
- Thank you, Louis.
- We're gonna win.

886
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:43,632
You did win.

887
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,571
Don't worry.
I'm not going to take your cat.

888
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:47,867
I am a man of honor.

889
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,475
Well, that's very gracious
of you.

890
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,076
In fact, I'm glad
we had this trial

891
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,782
because you and I both know
you didn't win

892
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:53,878
on the merits
of the case.

893
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,089
You won because
the associates prefer

894
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,288
your tough love
to my light touch.

895
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:03,729
- Yeah, they do.
- But Mikado belongs with me.

896
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,193
And this trial showed me
there's something

897
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:08,162
you care about
more than her.

898
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,467
- Nothing.
- Yes.

899
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,970
The associates.

900
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:18,077
I'm offering you
a settlement.

901
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,077
No.

902
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,453
You get back
the associates.

903
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:26,286
I get back my cat.
No.

904
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,288
II need a moment to confer
with my client.

905
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,494
Of course.

906
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:38,074
I do love her, you know?

907
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:52,728
Louis, as your attorney,
I need to say this...

908
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,662
Please don't
make me choose.

909
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,400
She's Nigel's cat.

910
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:02,139
You were right.

911
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:03,509
No one's ever going
to believe

912
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:06,341
that Ava didn't know
what her number two was up to.

913
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:08,109
It was worth trying.

914
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:11,417
It was worth trying
because she really didn't know.

915
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,557
And no one's ever going
to believe it

916
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,894
because she should've known.

917
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,463
Jessica, Ava and Nick
are not the same as you and me.

918
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,372
I know.
They're not.

919
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:24,879
She didn't wanna know what was
happening under her nose.

920
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:25,879
I do.

921
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,919
And the only reason

922
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:28,216
why I didn't see it
this time

923
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,056
is because I never thought
you'd do that to me.

924
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,001
- I didn't do it to you.
- You put it in motion.

925
00:37:32,057 --> 00:37:34,361
And then I stopped it.
And then I told you about it.

926
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:37,101
What I wanna know
is why.

927
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:40,037
You coulda just
let it go,

928
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,132
never said a word.

929
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,037
I told you
because enough was enough

930
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,343
and I didn't want anymore
secrets between us.

931
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,514
No, when you cheat on someone
and tell them about it,

932
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,251
it's not to make them
feel better.

933
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,724
It's to make yourself
feel better.

934
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,124
Yeah, unless you think
there's a chance

935
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,356
that they're gonna
find out.

936
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,997
Or you think
telling them

937
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:01,030
is going to make them
wanna get out of their merger.

938
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:03,167
I guess we've stopped
with the cheating analogy.

939
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,504
Yes, we have.

940
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,977
Now, did you come clean
to heal our relationship

941
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:12,283
or to make me want out
of the merger?

942
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,819
Like I just
told you,

943
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:17,483
I did it because I didn't want
to keep anymore secrets.

944
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,091
But I have never kept it
a secret

945
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,755
that I want out
of this merger.

946
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:22,355
You didn't answer
the question.

947
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,662
Okay, if you're asking
if I knew

948
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:29,240
that coming clean about Darby
would make you furious with him,

949
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:30,771
I'd be lying
if I didn't say

950
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,780
it crossed my mind.

951
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,012
So you set me up.

952
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,982
No, all I did
is what you've taught me to do

953
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,615
for a long time.

954
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:37,953
And it didn't change
your mind.

955
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:41,891
It just put you in touch
with what you already felt.

956
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,265
You really could be
managing partner.

957
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,296
But I'm not.

958
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,906
And I don't
wanna be.

959
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:57,412
So...

960
00:38:57,477 --> 00:39:01,487
What are we gonna do
about this trial?

961
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:05,227
As much as Mikado
means to you,

962
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:07,162
I know the associates
mean more.

963
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:09,900
No, not more.

964
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:14,579
The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of one.

965
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,780
- What philosopher said that?
- Spock.

966
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:19,149
<i>The Wrath of Khan?</i>

967
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:21,488
I will take her back
to Nigel for you.

968
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:24,892
Well, thanks for doing this
for me, Rachel.

969
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:28,668
But I want to do something
for you first,

970
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:33,545
a reward of sorts
for your victory.

971
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,243
See, I was right to pick you
to be my lawyer.

972
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:39,451
And as it turns out,

973
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:43,457
Columbia Law School agrees.

974
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:44,554
Louis, what--

975
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,860
I saw it on mail cart
this morning.

976
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,965
I wanted to save it
for you.

977
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:53,594
Congratulations, Rachel.
You're gonna be a lawyer.

978
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:56,604
A real lawyer.

979
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:05,478
- Donna, where's Harvey?
- He's with Jessica.

980
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:06,646
Where?
They're not in her office.

981
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,717
- They're on the roof.
- Okay.

982
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:08,917
Get them down here
right now.

983
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:10,084
- Mike, what's wrong?
- I said now.

984
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:11,550
Mike.

985
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:12,623
What's wrong?

986
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:13,727
I know why Stephen needed
to know

987
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,823
what Mariga said
in his deposition.

988
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,191
Why?

989
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:21,368
He was afraid that Mariga
would tell the truth.

990
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:25,370
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

991
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:34,980
Emmanuel Mariga
20 years ago

992
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,554
at the University of Cape Town
as an Econ major.

993
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,049
Always had a head
for business.

994
00:40:39,122 --> 00:40:41,619
He was also
on the rugby team.

995
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,591
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

996
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:45,465
Stephen's record
from Cambridge included

997
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:49,535
a semester abroad
at the University of Cape Town.

998
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,469
That year's team.

999
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,573
They had
a hell of a season.

1000
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:55,941
They're still
a team.

1001
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:56,942
Darby was clear.

1002
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,142
Whenever he has
a problem,

1003
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,880
Stephen's the one
he sends in to fix it.

1004
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,343
And Ava's problem
was his problem.

1005
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,109
So when she came to him
to get her pipeline built--

1006
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,181
He went to Stephen.

1007
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:05,118
And you wanna know
what it took

1008
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:06,349
to set up
those murders?

1009
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:08,454
One phone call
to Mariga,

1010
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,319
from the offices
of Darby International,

1011
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:12,622
from Stephen Huntley's
London office.

1012
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:14,988
From there, Mariga calls Nick,
Nick calls Ava,

1013
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:16,325
and the whole thing is set
in motion.

1014
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,797
They thought they were paying
for a bribe.

1015
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:19,061
But they were actually paying
for murder.

1016
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,487
And they never knew
the connection.

1017
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:22,299
And when Ava's about to be
charged for murder,

1018
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:25,817
Stephen shows up to make sure
we'd never find out.

1019
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:29,155
I'm so sorry, harvey.

1020
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:37,750
Harvey.

1021
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:40,871
Harvey, what are
you gonna do?

1022
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:07,090
Ah!

1023
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,121
