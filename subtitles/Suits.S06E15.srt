Why haven't I met him before?

314
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,844
You know why.
So why don't we just get to it?

315

We need you to hack
into Velocity Data's

317
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:29,760
Now, can you do it or not?

318
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:30,894
You want to say that
a little bit louder

319
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,162
so the Fed over there
can hear it?

320
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,353
Relax, Jerry.
What Louis is trying to say

321
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,589
is there's a woman who
works there who has information

322
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,390
we need to make a deal.

323
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:41,260
Make a deal?

00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:43,395
Ah, I don't know.
That's starting to sound

325
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:46,065
like blackmail, which is
a little bit out of my league.

326
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,666
Bullshit.
It's in your league.

327
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,379
And it's starting to sound
like you're renegotiating,

328
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,370
like you always do.
You know what, Louis?

329
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,839
I just about had enough of
your bullshit over the years.

330
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,242
I renegotiate 'cause
you low-ball me.

331
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:58,344
- No, I told--
- Jerry, you're not dealing

332
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,123
with Louis on this one,
you're dealing with me.

333
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,225
So why don't you tell me
what you need

334
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,215
and let's get this thing done?

335
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,050
If I'm gonna access anything,

336
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:06,952
I need to know more than
you just told me.

337
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:07,998
'Cause I don't get
what you want,

338
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,488
there's no going
back a second time.

339
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:11,134
All right, there's a woman
who works at Velocity

340
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:12,891
who slept with
the in-house counsel

341
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,160
at my client's company
and convinced him to sell

342
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,462
confidential information.

343
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,831
Let me guess,
she promised him the Moon,

344
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:22,134
then hung him out to dry.
Yeah, why?

345
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,336
You don't need to
access Velocity's records.

346
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,205
She doesn't work there.
How do you know?

347
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,174
Because I know who she is.

348
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,711
And the price just tripled.
Tripled?

349
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,213
You hypocritical piece of shit.

350
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,048
You don't even have
to access anything.

351
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,383
Well, you know what they say.

352
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:39,918
You don't pay the plumber
for banging on the pipes.

353
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,887
You pay him for knowing
where to bang.

354
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,889
Yahtzee.

355
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,202
And I'm telling you,
where I'm banging,

356
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:47,660
a whole lot of shit's
gonna fall out.

357
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,862
So you're either gonna pay up
or you're not.

358
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,541
Am I interrupting?

359
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,476
To tell you the truth,
I've just been

360
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,146
staring at this screen
for the past 15 minutes.

361
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,581
That's what I do all day.
I call it working.

362
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,419
But I'm going to guess
that's not why you're staring.

363
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,753
I was thinking about Mike.

364
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,822
He told you
he gave up the deal?

365
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,959
He did, and, um...

366
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,462
he said that he's okay
not being a lawyer.

367
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,599
But the look on his face
didn't say that at all.

368
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,279
Then you might be interested
in what I have to say.

369
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,471
Because it involves getting Mike
into the Bar after all.

370
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,020
Harvey, why are you telling me
this instead of Mike?

371
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,422
Because you asked me to
pull the plug

372
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,079
on this whole thing
if it got too risky,

373
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,425
and what I'm talking about
is gonna make it

374
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,681
a hell of a lot riskier.

375
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,783
And what did Mike say?

376
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,353
- He doesn't want to do it.
- Why not?

377
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,755
You know why not.
It's not 100% legal.

378
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,957
And you can say no
if you want to.

379
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,593
But that look you saw
on his face,

380
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,830
that's not going away
any time soon.

381
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,933
Okay.

382
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,468
I'm in.
But this time,

383
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,971
if something goes wrong,
you take the fall.

384

Okay, I will.

Now, you gonna go back

Yeah, you did.
I can see it in your face.

Well, I suggest you tell them
you accidentally added a zero.

473

Because you're not getting
a nickel more.

Let me remind you, Mr. Palmer.

475

We filed 150 suits against you.

But who's gonna supply
the manpower

479
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,554
to fight those suits now?
You know who.

Oh.
