1
00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:02,402
<i>Previously on</i>
Suits...

2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:05,540
I want to work with you.
Come to Pearson Specter.

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:06,725
If all you want to do
is work with me,

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,259
I can find a job
somewhere else.

5
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:11,096
Scottie,
that's not all I want.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,982
- Then say it.
- I want you in my life.

7
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,652
It's over, Mike.
I'm onto you.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,053
And I'm going to expose you

9
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:21,406
for the lying piece of filth
that you are.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,775
Louis, I went to Harvard.
I just changed my grade.

11
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,276
You cheated,

12
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,061
and now you're looking at me
to help you get away with it.

13
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,780
- No, Louis--
- Get out of my sight.

14
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,064
Louis, he did it
so that he can practice

15
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,282
the thing that we all love.

16
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:33,234
And if you don't let it go,

17
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,236
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

18
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,504
You make Mike confess,

19
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:37,956
you might as well throw his life
down the toilet.

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,574
You say we're friends.

21
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,092
A friend wouldn't ask me
to do this.

22
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:42,594
No, Louis.

23
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:45,580
A friend just won't hold it
against you if you don't.

24
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,221
Hey.

25
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:56,191
Where did you race off to
so quickly this morning?

26
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:57,592
I went to see my mistress.

27
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:59,093
Mm. Mm-hmm,
and what's her name?

28
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,478
Felony.

29
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:02,063
Really?

30
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:04,199
And how would you feel
if I said the same thing to you?

31
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,483
It depends.
Is she hot?

32
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:06,934
Mmhmm, you realize

33
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,453
you're just digging yourself in
deeper now, don't you?

34
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:11,289
Well, then it's good that I
was really out getting you...

35
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,041
This.

36
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:15,493
Minnie Mouse.

37
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:17,945
[Laughs]
I got a copy from your dad.

38
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,582
I thought
it would complement Panda.

39
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,884
It's perfect.

40
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,837
Good, because I have
a new lease on life.

41
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,258
And I wouldn't
if it weren't for you.

42
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,894
I am not the only one

43
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,296
who helped convince Louis
to let it go.

44
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:36,564
I know.

45
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:38,132
So are you gonna get
something for Harvey?

46
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:39,344
I want to,
but what do you get

47
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,468
the man
who has everything?

48
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,653
The same thing you got me.

49
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:44,305
A picture of him
dressed as a mouse?

50
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,191
No.

51
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,643
Something money can't buy.

52
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:50,195
Hmm.

53
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,998
[Groans]
What do you need?

54
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,617
- Advice.
- That tie has got to go.

55
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:58,536
I've been wanting
to say something for months.

56
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,755
It's not about the tie,
is it?

57
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:01,923
You know
it's not about the tie.

58
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,425
You're just giving me shit.

59
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:05,326
We take our opportunities
where they present themselves.

60
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:08,663
Now what can Donna do
for you?

61
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:11,216
- I need the perfect gift.
- Mm. Who is it?

62
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,167
Rachel?
Something personal,

63
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,836
preferably a picture
from her father.

64
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,504
How could you possibly--

65
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,806
- Jessica?
Simple and elegant.

66
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:20,007
Or wild and crazy,
the choice is yours.

67
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:23,010
Louis?
Oh, God, doesn't matter.

68
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,946
Just get him anything.
He'll cry for days.

69
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:26,314
What about Harvey?

70
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:29,350
There is no gift for Harvey.

71
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,618
He gets what he wants,

72
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,120
and he doesn't want
what he doesn't get.

73
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,155
And my knowing that is the only
gift he'll ever need from me.

74
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,574
Donna, ever since
I've been here,

75
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,579
every morning, I step
off that elevator wondering

76
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:40,161
if this is going to be
my last day.

77
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:43,214
Last week, that day came,
and Harvey said, "not today."

78
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,999
I...

79
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,468
I just--I need
to get him something

80
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,471
to let him know
what that means to me.

81
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,841
- Okay.
- What?

82
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,877
There is one thing that Harvey
has been wanting to get

83
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,429
for years,
and he hasn't been able to.

84
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:01,549
- What is it?
- No, it's too personal.

85
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,684
And I don't see
how you're going to be able

86
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,096
to make it happen
when he couldn't.

87
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,105
Whatever it is,
it'll make the perfect gift.

88
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,573
Before we do anything else,

89
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:11,559
I'd like to officially welcome
our newest senior partner,

90
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,911
Dana Scott.

91
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,755
I'd like to thank you all
for bringing me in.

92
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,082
And I assure you, I will be
hitting the ground running.

93
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,701
Well, that's what
we like to hear.

94
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,619
Harvey, where do we stand
on Franklin Courier?

95
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,539
They just announced plans
for the acquisition Friday.

96
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,424
I'd like to take lead
on this one.

97
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,377
I guess the ground
has been hit.

98
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,212
It's yours.

99
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,881
Shit.
I am so sorry.

100
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,215
I had an incident at Logan.

101
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,217
Did I miss anything?
Not really.

102
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,469
Scottie's going to be handling
the Franklin acquisition.

103
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,854
You're kidding, right?

104
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:41,723
Franklin's my client.
I was five minutes late.

105
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,224
Ten minutes, actually.

106
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,059
Well, I don't care
if I skipped

107
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,562
the whole goddamn meeting
to get a full-body wax.

108
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:50,114
I landed that company when
they were a regional shithole,

109
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,933
and I don't need
some interloper to--

110
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:53,902
Scottie's a senior partner,
Louis.

111
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,954
Oh, this is bullshit.

112
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,906
Then I guess you're saying
the bylaws are bullshit.

113
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:01,075
My bylaws are a work of art.

114
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:02,827
I know.

115
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,329
And the bylaws clearly state
that if a senior partner

116
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:05,797
is more than ten minutes late
to a meeting,

117
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07,632
he or she has no standing.

118
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,300
Well, that rule doesn't take
into consideration

119
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:12,453
a partner being late due
to reasons beyond his control.

120
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,888
Wait.
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:16,424
"This rule shall not be abridged
by any circumstance,

122
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,292
"including but not limited
to family illness,

123
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,824
"criminal detention,
and travel delay.

124
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:24,465
For without punctuality,
we are animals," right?

125
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,235
How dare you quote me to me?
This isn't over.

126
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,770
Yes, it is.

127
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:30,355
They're still
your client, Louis,

128
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,473
but it's Scottie's transaction.

129
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,858
Moving on.

130
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,695
Boom.

131
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,280
What's this?

132
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:41,833
Oh, it's only the greatest
gift you've ever received.

133
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,669
Better than M.J.'s jersey
from the 63-point game?

134
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:46,287
If this folder had played
in that game,

135
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,538
it would have scored
80 points.

136
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,790
Okay, I don't even know
what that means.

137
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:50,675
Neither do I.
Just open it.

138
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,677
A run-of-the-mill
corporate case.

139
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,161
I don't get it.

140
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:57,215
Just look at the attorney
of record on the other side.

141
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,517
A. Eliot Stemple.

142
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,718
How did you know?

143
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,169
I talked to Donna.
She told me everything.

144
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:04,389
- Define "everything."
- Oh, I don't know.

145
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,774
He kicked your ass in moot court
three years running at Harvard.

146
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:08,526
You're kind of upset about it.
It keeps you up at night.

147
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,511
Yeah, well,
if she told you everything,

148
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,064
you'd know he's been ducking me
for the past ten years.

149
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:14,282
Harvey, I just told you

150
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,067
this gift is
better than M.J.'s jersey.

151
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,485
Do you think
I'd make that kind of claim

152
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,617
if I couldn't deliver
on it?

153
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:19,621
What are you saying?

154
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:20,955
I'm saying

155
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,208
that A. Eliot Stemple
is not ducking you today.

Louis, if this is
about Franklin Courier,

167
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,102
I've made my decision.

168
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,637
- It's not.
- Okay.

169
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,005
Then what's this about?

170
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:15,473
- It's about Franklin Courier.
- Louis.

171
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:16,891
Jessica, I want to know where
I fall in the pecking order

172
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,060
with regard to Dana Scott.
There is no pecking order.

173
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,062
I don't look at things that way.
Great.

174
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:23,307
That means I'm behind her
because she's banging Harvey.

175
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,949
I'm going to pretend
I didn't just hear that.

176
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,367
Well, unfortunately,

177
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,869
I can't pretend that
you didn't just screw me over

178
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,021
on behalf
of your partner's girlfriend.

179
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,407
Louis,
I didn't screw you over.

180
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,575
Your own bylaws did.

181
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,994
And if the shoe
were on the other foot

182
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:37,462
and you'd taken
the case from her,

183
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,080
you'd be sleeping
like a baby.

184
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,665
What does that have to do
with anything?

185
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:42,000
All right, you know what, don't
bother answering that question.

186
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:45,253
As far as I'm concerned,
Dana Scott is dead to me.

187

Louis...

188
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:50,541
Did it ever occur to you
that these situations

189
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,811
may sometimes be a result
of your own doing?

What on God's green earth
are you talking about?

You have an opportunity
to bond

192
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,350
with our newest
senior partner

193
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,235
or make a permanent enemy
of her.

194
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,187
And I'm saying, in the past,

195
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:05,023
you've generally chosen
the enemy route.

196

a specific?

197

- Off the top of my head?
- Mm-hmm.

Pemberton, Yates, Cohen,
Duffner, Ramirez...

199

That's
five isolated incidents.

Robinson, Jenkins, Gardner.

201
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,372
Okay, okay, fine.
What's your point?

202
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,509
My point is,
if you let this thing go,

203
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,461
you can change
the entire course

204
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,347
of your relationship
with Scottie...

205

And who knows,

206
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,218
maybe even redefine yourself
within the firm.

you may have just changed

209
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,395

Is that a bomb?
It's a gift.

212
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,092
You're giving me a gift after
what happened this morning?

213
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,259
You're right.

214
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,646
You did poach my client
on a technicality.

215
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,131
And worse than that,

216
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:23,768
you used my own precious words
against me, and normally,

217
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,686
I'd declare war, but--
But what?

218
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,322
It's been pointed out to me
that I have certain proclivities

219
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,657
that need to be adjusted.

220
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,159
Louis,
what are you saying?

221
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,112
I'm saying I would like us
to be friends.

222
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,787
It's very sweet.

223
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:46,157
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

224
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,377
- So we're friends?
- Friends.

225
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,295
Great.
Give me my files back.

Excuse me?

You accepted my friendship.
Give me back my case.

Uh, sorry, Louis.
That's not how it works.

What the hell
kind of friend are you?

230

I'm a friend who is not going
to give you my case

No, no, no,

It's one
of the world's finest pashminas.

There is no article 19.5/b.

for three huge losses.

this thing for you too?

314
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,752
Listen to me.
This isn't thunderdome.

315
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,338
I need you to look at every case
he's worked since law school.

316
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,806
Relax, Harvey.
I'm all over it.

317
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:24,058
You better be,
because you don't know this guy.

318
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm telling you,
once it sinks in

319
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,645
that there's no way
out of that cage,

320
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:31,048
he's gonna
come out swinging.

321
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,880
You wasted a trip.
Harvey's gone for the night.

322
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,985
I'm not here to see Harvey.
I'm here to see you.

323
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,854
Please, what I have to say
is important.

324
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,388
I'm not interested
in what you have to say.

325
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,909
In law school,
I had nothing.

326
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:51,077
Nothing.

327
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,496
No friends, no girlfriend,
no respect.

328
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:57,783
The truth is, I was hanging on
to not flunking out by a tread.

329
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,620
Look at me.
I'm not married.

330
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:04,540
I don't have children.
I'm not particularly successful.

331
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:07,743
Why are you
telling me this?

332
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,346
I have a little piece of glory
that I've been holding on to,

333
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:13,248
and I don't expect Harvey
to care about that.

334
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,684
But you're still first chair.

335
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:17,970
You can still let me out.

336
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:21,724
And I thought
that maybe you would.

337
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:24,426
[Sighs]
I'll think about it.

338
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:26,062
That's all I can ask for.

339
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:29,565
Except for one thing.

340
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:32,284
That's the exact same speech
that your plaintiff gave Harvey,

341
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,402
year one.

342
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,738
Doesn't mean it isn't true.

343
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,189
You think
I'm gonna let you play me?

344
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,874
A man can try.

345
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,626
Stemple, you've been ducking
Harvey long enough.

346
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:43,245
Now you're either gonna win,
or you're gonna lose.

347
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:46,415
What you're not gonna do
is avoid him anymore.

348
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,085
Oh, and you forgot.

349
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:50,386
I looked up your family tree.

350
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,254
You are married,
you do have children,

351
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:54,090
and your firm is top tier.

352
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,475
Please, I hate my wife,
my children are anchors,

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,260
and the only reason
I stay at that firm

354
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,229
is to pay for them
to leave me alone.

355
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,733
[Elevator dings]

356
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,434
Get the hell on the elevator,
Stemple.

357
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,319
I'm not leaving you
in our office.

358
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,971
Good call.

359
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,646
[Sighs]

360
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:18,998
[Rolling dice]

361
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,416
Eliot Stemple,
that's a blast from the past.

362
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:21,951
You should have seen
his smug face

363
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,485
when he realized
he couldn't duck me.

364
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:24,653
Need my help?

365
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,839
No, I am taking this one
all for myself.

366
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:29,375
Harvey,
it was three times.

367
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,699
You remember
what it did to you?

368
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,128
Yeah, I remember.

369
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,846
But instead of offering help
where it isn't needed,

370
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,514
you should be focused
on Louis Litt.

371
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,466
After what you did
at that meeting,

372
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,185
he's going to come at you
full-bore.

373
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,521
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

374
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,641
You picked a fight
with him on purpose.

375
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,342
- Of course I did.
- What happened to the whole

376
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,445
"we need to be open
and honest" thing?

377
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,180
I didn't think we needed
to be open and honest

378
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,531
that one plus one
equals two.

379
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,150
I get it.

380
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,651
You don't want to be seen
as my girlfriend,

381
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:56,902
so you picked a fight
with the biggest,

382
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,320
baddest prisoner
in the yard.

383
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,706
I win this, I'm the partner
that beat Louis Litt,

384
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,875
not the partner sleeping
with Harvey Specter.

385
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,827
Okay, I respect that.

386
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,796
But Louis just did me
a huge favor,

387
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,197
and I don't want to get caught
in the middle of it.

388
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,666
I don't need you
in the middle of it.

389
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:11,667
Good.

390
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,636
Although...

391
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,037
What did you do?

392
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,255
Well, it's not really
what I did.

393
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,476
It's, um...
[Clears throat] What you did.

394
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:22,394
What did I do?

395
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,763
Louis,
what are you doing here?

396
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:25,881
Hey, I got your email
last night.

397
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,933
- Yeah, about that--
- No, no, no.

398
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:29,885
I was happy to get it,
happy to do the work.

399
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,220
Nothing makes me happier

400
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,404
than to spend all night
helping out a friend.

401
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,889
You were up all night?

402
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,774
Caught a power nap
between 4:30 and 4:45.

403
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,526
I'll be fine.

404
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:38,994
Well,
what'd you come up with?

405
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,329
Per your instructions,

406
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,580
I went through eight years

407
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,332
of Pritchard Holdings
corporate returns

408
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,201
with a fine-tooth comb.

409
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:47,086
That's a remarkably long
time frame.

410
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,004
Yeah, you ask for four,
I give you eight.

411
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,256
It's what I do.

412
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,541
And I caught every mistake
there was to find.

413
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:53,926
Great.
File the amended returns.

414
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,211
With any luck,

415
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:59,298
Jenner Pharmaceuticals
will be none the wiser.

416
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:00,850
Jenner Pharmaceuticals?

417
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,351
This suit's
against Miller Trucking.

418
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:05,771
That's what I meant,
Miller Trucking.

419
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,890
Ah.

420
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,591
What are they
suing them for?

421
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,759
Trucking?

422
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,928
God damn it.

423
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:14,429
You sent that email
just to screw with me.

424
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,565
Louis,
I didn't send the email.

425
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,783
Scottie did.

426
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:19,318
She used my computer.
I didn't even know.

427
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:21,120
Oh, bullshit.
She came running to you.

428
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,371
You played on our friendship.

429
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:23,706
And just now
you had me go on about it

430
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,773
to continue the mockery.

431
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:26,041
Look, I wasn't mocking you.

432
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,110
I was trying to keep you
from finding out.

433
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,212
I thought if you didn't know,
no harm would be done.

434
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,581
No, you know what,
harm was done.

435
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,633
And if you value
this friendship at all,

436
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,085
you would stay out of it,

437
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,753
because I'm going
to the mattresses

438
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:38,888
against Dana Scott.

439
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:40,256
Mattresses?

440
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,091
Have you been watching
<i>The Godfather?</i>

441
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,625
Yeah, I've been trying to
come up with some common ground

442
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,761
to expand our friendship--
sue me.

443
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,480
[Sighs]

444
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,966
Tell me you finished
the proposal

445
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,318
for Franklin Courier.

446
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,402
No.

447
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,803
What do you mean, no?

448
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,638
I mean I didn't do it.

449
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,023
What, did your mother die?

450
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,388
Because if she didn't,
you know--

451
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,026
Louis,
you told me not to.

452
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,578
We're at war, Bennett.
Why would I do that?

453
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,165
I don't know,
but I got a note from you

454
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,497
telling me that you were gonna
be the bigger person

455
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:06,749
and let Dana Scott handle it.

456
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:07,983
The bigger person?

457
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,151
You should've known
that was not from me.

458
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,202
[Knocking on door]

459
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,754
Good morning, Louis.
Great day.

460
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,488
Oh, you look a little tired.

461
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm not tired.
I don't get tired.

462
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,009
What do you want, Dana?
I'm just dropping this by.

463
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,594
You sent Franklin
a proposal?

464
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:19,878
Well, I couldn't meet them
without you,

465
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,164
so I figured that I would
send this over instead.

466
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,999
You did this
behind our backs.

467
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,769
I don't believe in doing
things behind people's backs.

468
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,687
That's why I c.c.'d you both
on this letter.

469
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,773
No, you c.c.'d us, so they'd
know that it came from you,

470
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,120
and we had nothing to do
with it.

471
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,275
It did come from me,

472
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,777
and you did have nothing
to do with it.

473
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:36,278
Yeah, you want to play it
this way, fine.

474
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,896
But if you think
you can outsmart me,

475
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,481
you're gonna get Litt up.
Litt the hell up.

476
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,483
Litt up?

477
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:43,702
Litt. Oh.

478
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:46,372
[Laughs]
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

479
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:48,023
I'm gonna go make fun of it
on my Facebook page right now.

480
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:49,524
Thank you.

481
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,081
Okay, we're gonna take
this thing apart limb by limb

482
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,416
so that little Miss Bullshit

483
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,301
wished she'd never heard
the name Louis Litt.

484
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,136
Louis,
she's an excellent attorney.

485
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,554
What if we can't find
anything wrong with it?

486
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,039
We're not gonna find
anything wrong with it.

487
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,424
That's why we're gonna
take it apart,

488
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,558
to make something wrong
with it.

489
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:09,011
Mr. Walker,
in October of last year,

490
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,729
you made a pitch to the chairman
of Kyoto Computers.

491
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,047
How did that pitch go?

492
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,048
It went amazingly,

493
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,767
right up
until when they told us

494
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,568
there was no way they could
actually buy our product.

495
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,020
And why was that?

496
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:20,222
Because Janus threatened
to withhold their microchip

497
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:23,075
if Kyoto did even $1 worth
of business with us.

498
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,527
And my next-door neighbor says
he saw his next-door neighbor

499
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:26,895
cheating on his wife.

500
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:28,664
Turned out to be nothing
but a vindictive lie.

501
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:31,533
These are sworn affidavits
from the CEOs of Kyoto, Griffon,

502
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:35,237
and Howland all backing up
Mr. Walker's claim.

503
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:39,458
This isn't your next-door
neighbor, Archibald.

504
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,910
Mr. Walker, the truth is
that we control the market

505
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,380
because our product is
better than yours, isn't it?

506
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,081
No, it isn't.

507
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,933
Jake, come on.
The cameras are on.

508
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,185
We're all under oath here.
We are?

509
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:51,603
He is.

510
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:54,056
And I have
independent analysis

511
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,091
and sworn testimony
from other CEOs

512
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,093
disputing everything
your client just said.

513
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,612
Those things aren't worth
the paper they're printed on.

514
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,431
My point is
that you can go to court,

515
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:05,100
spend years fighting
a battle you may not win,

516
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:08,454
or you can take
this settlement.

517
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,910
This is actually
pretty fair.

518
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,628
More than fair.

519
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,613
The only thing is, he's trying
to get us to sign it,

520
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,215
so he can use it against us
in court.

521
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,051
Just like he did last year
against Micron

522
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,053
and the year before that
against Suntech.

523
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,255
You're just a one-trick pony,
Archibald.

524
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,957
And once you've been
to the show, it's not that good.

525
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:32,061
Hmm, you're a one-trick pony
too, Reginald.

526
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,796
Only my trick doesn't end
with my own client suing me.

527
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:37,733
- This deposition's over.
- What do you mean, it's over?

528
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,080
Don't you want
Mr. Walker to know

529
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,769
that you were just sued
for malpractice?

530
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,104
That client
dropped that suit.

531
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,073
And before she did,
she stated on the record

532
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,525
that she got shafted because
you had a personal vendetta

533
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,143
against your opposing counsel.

534
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:50,329
He likes to pick fights
with other lawyers,

535
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,030
and he doesn't give a shit
what it does to his clients.

536
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:54,483
- Okay, that's a lie.
- It is?

537
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,818
I think you and I both know
why he took this case,

538
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,088
because he lost this case
and this case

539
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,039
and this case to me
15 years ago.

540
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,591
Go ahead, ask him.

541
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,426
He's not under oath,
but you'll know if he's lying.

542
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,928
And these cases,
they were all in moot court.

543
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:08,547
Imagine what he'll bring down
on you when the stakes are real.

544
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,015
I can tell you this much,

545
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,433
it'll be a hell
of a lot more expensive

546
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,601
than that settlement.

547
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:15,521
Stemple, we're done.

548
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:19,274
Reginald,
you did a great job

549
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:20,893
making it so I couldn't
get out of it,

550
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:24,279
but you should have picked
a better case to trap me in.

551
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,817
Because we both know
that my independent analyst

552
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:33,372
will come up with anything
that I want him to say.

553
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,326
Did you hear
what he just said?

554
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:38,494
I sure did.

555
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,045
And if you did, and I did...

556
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,631
Maybe it did.

557
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,068
♪
I already had breakfast, Michael.

558
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,454
Maybe, but that's a bag
completely filled with bacon.

559
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,455
Crispy?

560
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,790
To quote my friend Benjamin,

561
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:04,409
"if it's not crispy,
it's not bacon."

562
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,495
I don't deserve it.

563
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,662
Benjamin.

564
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,447
Michael, I can enhance
the sound of a bee

565
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,466
making pollen recorded
from a satellite.

566
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,751
How can you possibly
know that?

567
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:13,919
It's been done.

568
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,253
But what I can't do
is enhance sounds

569
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,888
that weren't picked up
by a used camcorder,

570
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,007
because this firm is too cheap
to go with my recommendation

571
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,459
of the $63,000 ZR-X90.

572
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,151
You didn't really
recommend that, did you?

573
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,730
It's also good for making
independent films on weekends.

574
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,014
Okay, Benjamin,

575
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,567
I need this audio,
or we're screwed on a huge case.

576
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,902
Michael,
look at these sound waves.

577
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,522
Okay.

578
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,240
There's nothing there.
No, nothing.

579
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,075
And that's after 12 hours of
maximum enhancement on the tape

580
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,476
and six Red Bulls in me.

581
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,446
Whoa, you shouldn't be having
that many Red Bulls.

582
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:42,748
I did it for you, Michael.

583
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,149
What do we have?

584
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,784
Uh, nothing.

585
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:48,787
Then we go
with what we got.

586
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:51,757
What's he talking about?

587
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:54,509
He's saying Stemple bluffed,
so now we're gonna bluff.

588
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,012
What exactly are we
talking about here, gentlemen?

589
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,999
We want access to the raw data
from his independent analysis.

590
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,135
And I wish I would've had
a vasectomy ten years ago.

591
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,837
But raw data is work product,
and he has no right to it.

592
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,055
The work product doctrine

593
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,523
is fairly clear on this,
Mr. Specter.

594
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,026
Except in cases of misconduct,
Your Honor,

595
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,944
is fairly clear on this,
which is the situation here.

596
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:15,614
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

597
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:18,233
At the end of our deposition,
Mr. Stemple basically boasted

598
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,952
that he plans to fix
the findings of his analyst.

599
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,120
That is a lie.

600
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:23,121
I never said anything
of the kind.

601
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:24,406
What you mean to say is

602
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,208
you didn't think our microphone
would pick it up.

603
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,793
So let me get this straight.

604
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,878
They're doctoring a tape to
accuse me of doctoring a report.

605
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,214
Mr. Stemple, you have
a history of lying to me.

606
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:33,582
So if you're on that tape

607
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,507
saying anything close
to what they're claiming,

608
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,421
I'll not only sanction you,
I'll report you to the bar.

609
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,890
I'll give them what they want.
[Scoffs]

610
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,476
I have to admit,
when I read 600 million Euros,

611
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:47,062
I thought it was a typo.
It wasn't.

612
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:48,880
Baltic Freight can get
a bottle of Riesling

613
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,016
from an Alsatian Vineyard
to a Dubai hotel in six hours.

614
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,518
This is a steal.
I agree. The proposal-

615
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:55,570
most riveting thing I've read
since <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

616
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:56,822
Both: But--

617
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,190
But the real upside for you
is that I...

618
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:59,574
- We.
- Not exactly.

619
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:01,226
Structured the deal
to avoid U.S. taxes.

620
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,862
By setting up a subsidiary
with headquarters in Cyprus.

621
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,280
Where the rate
is only 5.7%.

622
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:06,698
Wait a second,

623
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:09,067
doesn't that mean they would
have to build in Cyprus?

624
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:11,369
Mmhmm, and I've already
locked up a developer.

625
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,088
Yeah, I see that,
the Whitner Group.

626
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,840
Whoa, I'm so sorry.
Did you just say Whitner Group?

627
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:15,841
Right now
they're being investigated

628
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,092
by the FTC for fraud.

629
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,510
What?

630
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:21,179
Yeah, it was just announced
this morning.

631
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:22,214
Well,
those are bogus charges

632
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:24,049
concocted
by a jealous competitor

633
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,434
who will stop at nothing--
I'm so sorry, Tom.

634
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,254
As Dana mentioned,
I was c.c.'d on this,

635
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:30,922
but I didn't exactly
have a chance to vet it.

636
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:32,440
Tom.

637
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:33,525
Our reputation is everything,
Ms. Scott.

638
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:35,026
We can't be in bed
with criminals.

639
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,928
I will have another proposal
over to you within the hour.

640
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,113
Thank you, Louis.

641
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:40,532
Oh, and, Tom,
Scottie's new, okay?

642
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,900
So just cut her some slack.

643
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:43,235
Because when
those training wheels pop off,

644
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,954
she's gonna be
really, really good.

645
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,660
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

646
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,278
I just called a friend
at the FTC.

647
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,612
You made up charges
against a company

648
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:55,780
just to get back at me?

649
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:57,215
I did nothing of the kind.

650
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,363
I simply alerted a friend
to some possible misdoings.

651
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:01,803
These are people.
You are hurting their business.

652
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:03,138
Oh, please,
give me a break.

653
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:04,556
They're not publicly traded.

654
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:05,623
They don't have a stock price
that'll fall.

655
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:06,624
And if they're as clean
as you say,

656
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:07,959
I'm sure they'll be exonerated.

657
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,762
But not in time for me
to get Franklin's business.

658
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,297
Oh, I don't give a shit
when they're exonerated.

659
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,799
You're never getting
Franklin's business.

660
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,068
You really are a dick.

661
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:28,413
I'm Moby goddamn dick,
and you just swam in my waters.

662
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,672
Per your request,
this is everything.

663
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,675
You didn't just come over here
to deliver work product.

664
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,177
I've got
a revised settlement offer.

665
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,379
And before you say anything,
it contains a provision

666
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,931
prohibiting me
from using it against you.

667
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:48,666
After what happened today,
you think I'm going to settle?

668
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,238
Please, Harvey,
just take a look at it.

669
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:51,303
So now that
you need something,

670
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,171
it's Harvey, not Reginald.

671
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:54,439
Settling is what you do.

672
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:57,342
Not with you.

673
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:58,944
And the reason I'm not gonna
settle with you--

674
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,111
I get it.

675
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,780
I ducked you.

676
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,866
Look, I could take the losing,
the gloating, and the taunting.

677
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:07,235
But what I can't take
is losing to a coward

678
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,489
who's too afraid to stand up
and try to beat me again.

679
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,124
I didn't beat you
the first time.

680
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,828
What the hell
are you talking about?

681
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,463
It was rigged.

682
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,833
I bribed the jury.

683
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,169
- What?
- That's why I keep ducking you.

684
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,721
You're telling me
you cheated all three years?

685
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:29,557
[Sighs]
Once I won,

686
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,877
I was the guy
who beat Harvey Specter.

687
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,046
There was no going back.

688
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:38,216
And you think admitting that
now is gonna make me settle?

689
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:40,819
I'm coming clean because
it's time to put it to bed.

690
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,553
Put it to bed?

691
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:45,556
You gonna take an ad out in
the Crimson saying you cheated,

692
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,409
just like you did
when you beat me back then?

693
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,577
- Harvey.
- No, no, I remember it.

694
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,447
Muhammad Ali standing
over Sonny Liston.

695
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:54,616
Your face on Ali,
mine on Liston,

696
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,950
every day for a week.

697
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,069
You know who my hero was,
Eliot?

698
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,237
Ali.

699
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:02,073
That's right,
you piece of shit.

700
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,795
You want to know
why I did that?

701
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,047
Because you were
an arrogant bastard

702
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,249
who skated through life
without a care in the world,

703
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,185
getting everything you wanted
from anyone you needed!

704
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:17,555
And you know what,

705
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:19,974
if I had to do it again,

706
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,927
I would do
the exact same thing.

707
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:24,779
I'm not settling.

708
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:28,933
You so much as think about
breaking the law on this case,

709
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:32,603
I guarantee
you'll end up in jail.

710
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:47,372
Is this--
Yes.

711
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:49,247
- With extra--
- Yes.

712
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,833
- To what do I owe this honor?
- Dana Scott.

713
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,468
- No.
- Hear me out.

714
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:55,003
You won.

715
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:56,388
I'm not saying you have
to give in to her.

716
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,807
I'm saying,
make amends with her.

717
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,309
Mm, and why would I want
to do that?

718
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,310
Well, it would help
if you tried

719
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:03,795
putting yourself
in her shoes.

720
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:05,430
The same shoes that tried
walking away with my client?

721
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:07,099
Louis, all I'm saying is,

722
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,817
she came here
from Darby International

723
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:10,301
to be Harvey's girlfriend.

724
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:11,737
I'd say that's enough baggage

725
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,338
to deserve you
cutting her some slack.

726
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:14,806
But I did cut her
some slack, Donna.

727
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:16,241
I bought her
the world's finest pashmina,

728
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:17,492
and she wiped her ass
with it in return.

729
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:18,910
Okay, I got it.

730
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,695
You're never gonna like her.
Forget I said anything.

731
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

732
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,316
Did Harvey send you here?
No, Louis, he didn't.

733
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:26,651
Harvey doesn't care
about this.

734
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:28,503
Why do you?

735
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,955
[Sighs]

736
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:33,008
Because I know Harvey,
I know Scottie, and I know you.

737
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:35,293
And if somebody
doesn't back down,

738
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,928
this isn't gonna end well.

739
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,097
Are you saying
that you or Harvey

740
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,432
are gonna hold this
against me?

741
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,384
No, Louis,
I'm not saying that.

742
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,335
Good, because then
I'll tell you what I told him.

743
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:46,221
If our friendship
is dependent on this,

744
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:48,273
then we do not have
a friendship at all.

745
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,275
It's not.

746
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:54,512
I was just trying to help.

747
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,684
Mr. Morris,

748
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:02,454
please tell the court
what the raw data indicates

749
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,706
about the two companies'
microprocessors.

750
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,691
And I remind you,
you're under oath.

751
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:10,495
Both products operate
at the exact same rate.

752
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:12,330
What you're saying is,

753
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:14,966
our product is just
as good as theirs.

754
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,202
I'm saying their performance
is identical.

755
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:18,703
And yet Janus dominates
the marketplace.

756
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:19,838
Why is that?

757
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:21,873
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

758
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:23,258
Oh, I'll tell you why.

759
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:25,043
It has nothing to do
with product superiority

760
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,212
and everything to do with Janus
bullying its competitors.

761
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:28,713
That's not a question,

762
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:31,049
nor is it Mr. Morris' area
of expertise.

763
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,484
No, it isn't.

764
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,936
Bullying is his client's area
of expertise.

765
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:36,655
No further questions.

766
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:40,242
Mr. Morris,
you just testified

767
00:28:40,326 --> 00:28:43,895
that the microprocessors'
performance was identical.

768
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:46,414
Is it possible that they are
actually identical?

769
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:48,950
- Anything's possible.
- How would that be?

770
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:51,002
Either it's
a one-in-a-billion event,

771
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,338
or one of them stole
the other one's design.

772
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:54,873
Mm.

773
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:57,175
Your honor, based on evidence
introduced by opposing counsel

774
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,593
and Mr. Morris' testimony,

775
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:00,295
I would like to file
a countersuit

776
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,881
against AYZ
for patent infringement.

777
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,099
That is outrageous.

778
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:06,968
His client stole
my client's design.

779
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,436
I am the one
who is outraged.

780
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,939
This case has nothing to do
with patent infringement.

781
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:13,441
It does now, Reginald.

782
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:18,363
Move!
We need to talk.

783
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,098
Not now, I'm carbo-loading.

784
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,199
For what?

785
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,785
For you!
We're still at war.

786
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,953
No, we're not.

787
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:26,371
So what,

788
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:27,772
you're telling me
you're waving the white flag?

789
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:32,911
No, I am waving this,
bylaw 19.5/b,

790
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:35,280
in clear violation of 139/j.

791
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:37,115
I got ratification per 139j.

792
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,502
There wasn't
a quorum present.

793
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:41,836
Big deal,
technical violation.

794
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:43,972
Not for you.
You're on the bylaw committee.

795
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:46,808
And you know what the bylaws say
about a member of the committee

796
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:50,562
implementing an amendment
without approval?

797
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:51,646
Immediate removal.

798
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:52,981
So back the hell
off my case.

799
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:54,399
This won't stand.

800
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:58,320
Louis, I am warning you
to not keep pursuing this.

801
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:00,405
I've beaten you before,
and I will beat you again.

802
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,741
- You've never beaten me before.
- Haven't I?

803
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,827
Who do you think it was
that assigned Nigel

804
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:08,830
to go against you
in the dissolution talks?

805
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:10,248
Meow.

806
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,483
- You're the devil.
- No.

807
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:16,154
I'm not the devil.
I'm a strategic thinker.

808
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,290
Louis Litt,
you are hereby notified

809
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,861
that your services
are no longer needed

810
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,176
on Franklin Courier.

811
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,346
And if you go around me,
I will invoke 139j on your ass.

812
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:28,016
- He set us up.
- You think I don't know that?

813
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,467
He made our client
look like a thief.

814
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:30,719
It's not true.

815
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,003
It doesn't matter
if it's not true.

816
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:34,005
Now we're on the defensive.

817
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:36,641
Gentlemen,
that settlement offer

818
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,310
is about to get flipped
on its ass.

819
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,562
And thank you for introducing
that evidence,

820
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,480
'cause it wouldn't have been
as credible coming from me.

821
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:43,982
You dropped that comment
on purpose.

822
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,850
Mmhmm. I knew that camcorder
wouldn't pick it up,

823
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:47,953
just like I knew you would bluff
to get that data.

824
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,688
You made us work for it,
or we would've seen it coming.

825
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
[Laughs]

826
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,524
He would never have seen
anything coming

827
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:57,195
once I fed him that bullshit
about bribing the jury.

828
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,197
I've got your number,
Reginald.

829
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:02,133
I haven't been ducking you.
I've just been setting you up.

830
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:05,086
I took a page
from your hero's playbook,

831
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:08,306
rope-a-dope.

832
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,545
I heard about today.

833
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:16,064
If you hadn't,

834
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:18,429
I'm sure there'll be an ad
about it in the paper tomorrow.

835
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:20,602
What?

836
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:24,572
Stemple says he's got
my number, and it's true.

837
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,724
I don't know what to do.

838
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,276
What are our options?

839
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,681
For all I know, this deal's
the best I'm ever going to get.

840
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:33,448
Stemple's been outthinking me
ever since I met him.

841
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:36,584
You're the only other person
who's ever done that.

842
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:38,086
I need your help.

843
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,589
Have I ever told you about
my high school tennis career?

844
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:43,041
I didn't even know
you played.

845
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:46,127
I was 38 and 3.

846
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:48,680
You know who handed me
every one of those losses?

847
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:49,681
Eliot Stemple?

848
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:51,599
Marsha Myers.

849
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,084
[Sighs]

850
00:31:53,135 --> 00:31:57,755
A 5-foot-nothing math geek
with a 20-mile-an-hour serve.

851
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:00,258
I should have left
a Marsha Myers skid mark

852
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,277
on the court
and never looked back.

853
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:06,064
But instead, the little bitch
was a human backboard.

854
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,615
And I think about it
to this day.

855
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,783
You're saying
I should take the deal

856
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:09,951
because I can't beat him?

857
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,703
I'm saying
I know what it's like

858
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,738
to have an Eliot Stemple.

859
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,540
So I'm going to ask you
a question,

860
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:17,942
and I want you to give me
an instant response.

861
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:20,278
Do you want to beat him,
or do you want to settle?

862
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,163
I want to leave
an Eliot Stemple skid mark.

863
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:23,614
Then there's your answer.

864
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,283
If he's got your number,

865
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:29,304
then what you want to do
is what he wants you to do.

866
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,474
Harvey, I've been looking
at Stemple's cases.

867
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,392
Doesn't matter.

868
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,821
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

869
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,295
We're taking the settlement.

870
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:40,231
- You're just gonna give up?
- Jessica has a plan.

871
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,683
Fighting is stepping
into a trap.

872
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,101
We'd be giving him
exactly what he wants.

873
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:45,070
Jessica was wrong.

874
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,654
Is that a fact?

875
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,189
You looked at it
the right way.

876
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:49,824
You just came
to the wrong conclusion.

877
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:52,494
Stemple wants us to fight,
but I know why.

878
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:53,778
He was on this case

879
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:54,863
long before you and I
came into the picture.

880
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:57,665
What he wants--
what he really wants--

881
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,285
has nothing to do
with you.

882
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,907
Don't you look ready
to rumble?

883
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,241
We're not.

884
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,294
We want to take your deal,
with one small change.

885
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:20,213
- I'm not lowering the amount.
- No, don't worry.

886
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,465
Instead of $10 million,

887
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:23,300
we'd like to give you
100 million.

888
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:24,518
Because that would
still cost us less

889
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,137
than if we fought you
and you got this.

890
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,608
- I have no idea what that is.
- Yes, you do.

891
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,276
It's the glue
that enables AYZ

892
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,778
to stack more microchips
than you,

893
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:35,779
and you've been after it
for a year.

894
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,764
And when you saw me coming,

895
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,317
you used the opportunity
to bait me

896
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,952
into introducing evidence

897
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:44,771
so that you could turn it around
and manufacture a suit

898
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,491
to get your hands on that
during discovery.

899
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,712
You can't prove that.

900
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,448
I can when I ask
your analyst

901
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,717
why you hired him
in the first place.

902
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,169
He's gonna say
that Janus needed the technology

903
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,620
and was willing to do anything
to get it.

904
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,122
You don't know
that he'll roll over on me.

905
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,641
Ali versus Liston.

906
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:06,259
I'm gonna make him
roll over on you.

907
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,961
So here's
what's gonna happen.

908
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,796
You're gonna drop the suit,

909
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,799
publicly admit to wrongdoing,
and pay us this.

910
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,522
This'll cost my client
a fortune.

911
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:19,639
Yeah, but it's better
than being convicted

912
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,974
of corporate espionage.

913
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,660
Eliot, I'm giving you
a dignified way out,

914
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:27,164
a chance to really
put it to bed.

915
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,834
Now the judge is gonna bang
that gavel in 30 seconds.

916
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,837
And when that happens,
it's gonna be too late.

917
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:46,132
We'll take the deal.

918
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,936
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna quote a movie,

919
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,471
quote a movie.

920
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,772
I got one word wrong.

921
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,674
It changed the entire meaning
of the quote.

922
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,175
- Not to me, it didn't.
- [Laughing]

923
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,310
That's what I thought
the quote was.

924
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,645
Okay, fine.

925
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,730
You want to be disrespectful
to Martin Scorsese,

926
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,181
you go right ahead.

927
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,234
Martin Scorsese didn't even
write the damn movie.

928
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,119
If anything, it's disrespectful
to the writer.

929
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:08,187
Harvey, who cares
about the writer?

930
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,706
I guess
you're right about that.

931
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,825
- Where have you two been?
- I took him to dinner.

932
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,526
Oh, that's never
happened before.

933
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,695
Well, he's never beaten
A. Eliot Stemple before.

934
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,547
No, he hasn't.

935
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,333
What could be different
about this time?

936
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,668
I didn't work for him then.

937
