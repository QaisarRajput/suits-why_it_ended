"This poor girl
was brutally murdered

163
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,038
"at a high-end,
private school and, quote,

164
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,040
"'this doesn't
sound like the work

165
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:23,642
"of the squash team captain
to me.'"

166
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,010
I don't know, Harvey,
this article makes

167
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,846
a pretty compelling case
that he's guilty.

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,781
Well, he's not.

169
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,716
- It's quoting you.
- I was wrong.

170
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,817
Jessica,
I don't think you should

171
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,452
let Harvey take this case.

172
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:35,788
Louis, we're talking
about a man's life.

173
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,423
And if Harvey thinks
the kid didn't do it,

174
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:38,423
then so do I.

175
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,424
I understand that,

176
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,492
but what Harvey thinks

177
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,493
and what Harvey can prove

178
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,894
are two different things.

179
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,230
In my experience
with Harvey,

180
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:46,765
it's one and the same.

181
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,099
Listen to me--
he was set up.

182
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,401
Jill Hodgkins
went to him and said

183
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:51,836
that she was gonna turn in
these two other guys

184
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,904
for selling coke.

185
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,472
They killed her
and planted the coke

186
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:55,907
in Clifford's room.

187
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,209
I didn't buy his story
because his DNA was on her.

188
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,644
He claimed that it
was because they were

189
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:01,046
having this
secret relationship.

190
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,681
But he had no proof.

191
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,549
And now he does.

192
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,017
Okay, I hate
to disagree with you here,

193
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,053
but I took a little poll
of the partners--

194
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,421
Whoa. You did what?

195
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, I was discreet,
I assure you.

196
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,124
And they feel, as I do,

197
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,159
that Harvey's actions
will hurt this firm.

198
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,861
This firm?

199
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,195
You mean my firm.

200
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,363
And when you're
running the firm

201
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,198
of Litt, nothing,
and nobody,

202
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,234
then you can make
whatever call you'd like.

203
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,035
Until then,

204
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,871
you can just
get back to work.

205
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,605
I'm telling you,
those guys did it.

206
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,108
And as far as his violent
history is concerned,

207
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:31,576
you of all people
are gonna tell me

208
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,945
that a person can't change
if they get a second chance?

209
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,713
What do you need me to do?

210
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,790
Hey.

211
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,258
I need your help.

212
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,527
I thought I made it clear
that I don't expect

213
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,995
to hear those words
from your mouth ever again.

214
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:51,864
- It's important.
- It's always important.

215
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,098
- It's for Harvey.
- It's always for Harvey.

216
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,134
He specifically
asked for you.

217
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:56,302
By name?

218
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,604
He said he wanted the best.

219
00:07:57,638 --> 00:07:59,306
Well, if he didn't
specifically name me,

220
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,141
and you didn't specifically
tell him,

221
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,776
then I am going to
specifically decline.

222
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,444
[Sighs]

223
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,644
Rachel.

224
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,013
Are you kidding me?

225
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,583
Okay.

226
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,151
I know that you're
mad at me.

227
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,319
But we're talking about a guy
roughly our age

228
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:16,720
who spent over a decade
in prison

229
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:18,055
for a murder
that he didn't commit,

230
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,657
and we are trying
to get him out.

231
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,394
I think that's more important
than our little...

232
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,430
whatever.

233
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,431
Whatever?

234
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,599
You know what I mean.

235
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,135
Problems with two people.
Hill of beans.

236
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,304
I don't know what
you're talking about.

237
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,505
<i>Casablanca.</i>

238
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,973
Oh, I've never
seen that movie.

239
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,610
- You--
- No, it's--it's old.

240
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:37,811
Old?

241
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,213
Oh, my God.

242
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,249
Okay, what's your basis
for getting him out?

243
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,351
- Prosecutorial misconduct?
- Buried evidence.

244
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,753
Okay, then you need
precedence to overturn.

245
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,956
- I already got those.
- Then what?

246
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,357
I need to find out
everything I can

247
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:51,626
about the former D.A.'s cases.

248
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,128
[Sighs]

249
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,430
Okay.

250
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:59,165
<i>Gone With The Wind?</i>

251
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,200
- No.
- <i>Citizen Kane?</i>

252
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,935
- No.
- <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

253
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,236
Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.

254
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,271
- I can't believe you.
- I'm helping you.

255
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,539
- Let's go.
- Ah...

256
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:08,375
You thought to do this
on your own?

257
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,243
I decided
to think like you.

258
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,644
This is a high-profile
murder case

259
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,713
against the new district
attorney himself.

260
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,315
- You know that, right?
- I know.

261
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:16,649
And you think I'm gonna
let you come with me

262
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,985
for this, don't you?
I know you are.

263
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,586
You known, I don't want you
thinking like me and--

264
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:21,854
Now you know how
the rest of us feel.

265
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,556
- Aha, right there.
- I always would have said that.

266
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,790
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

267
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,696
Harvey Specter.

268
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,064
Terrance Wolf.
That's your case?

269
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:35,266
I thought it best
to cut a deal,

270
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,001
let him out for time served.

271
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,004
Hm, high profile murder
at a prep school.

272
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,639
No, I don't think I'll
be cutting any deals.

273
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,708
Miguel Ruiz,
Lawrence Baker,

274
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,544
Ray Jenkins,
Calvin Reynolds.

275
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:48,146
And who are
these gentlemen?

276
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,549
They're other cases
with improprieties

277
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,686
that we'll be forced to cite
if we have to file to reopen.

278
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,721
You, of all people,
don't want that.

279
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:57,857
Really? Why not?

280
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,226
Because it'll
make you look bad.

281
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,395
Didn't happen on my watch.

282
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,330
You're supposed to be
cleaning up the office.

283
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,499
I find sunshine is the best
disinfectant.

284
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,034
Your mother teach you that?

285
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:08,469
No, Harvey,
life taught me that.

286
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,971
This man's innocent.

287
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:11,272
Then he should have
gone to trial.

288
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,440
Evidence was buried.

289
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,075
Then dig it up.

290
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,077
And make your case.

291
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,980
Mike...give me a minute.

292
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:23,384
Terrance, you're
forcing me to do something

293
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,752
that I'd rather not do.

294
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,520
- And what is that?
- Take this case on.

295
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:27,554
I win.

296
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:28,956
It's what I do.

297
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,859
It'll send a message
around your entire office.

298
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,560
That you can't
handle your business.

299
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,595
Well, if I lose, I lose.

300
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,398
That's the way
the law works.

301
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:38,566
But, Harvey, don't think

302
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,401
I can't send a message
or two myself.

303
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,136
Rumor has
it you're the traitor

304
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,971
who sold out
his former boss.

305
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:45,139
It wasn't me.

306
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,374
Those rumors are wrong.

307
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,177
So mysterious evidence

308
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:51,079
from back in the day
on your old boss

309
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,415
just appeared?

310
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,719
You didn't know.

311
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,222
It wasn't you.

312
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:03,191
But it had to be somebody,
right, Harvey?

313
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,960
Have a nice day.

314
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,166
My office--now.

315
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:17,939
I have never thought about
firing you.

316
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,408
You took something
when we quit the D.A.'s office?

317
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,877
Come clean right now,
or I'll let you go

318
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,178
and not give it
a minute's thought.

319
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,279
[Sighs]

320
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:25,947
I knew it.

321
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,150
You were in trouble.

322
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,219
You had no right.

323
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,922
I don't care.

324
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,624
What'd you do with it?

325
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,126
She did
what she had to do.

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,127
She gave it to me.

327
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,162
And the two of you saw fit

328
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,630
to fight my battles for me?

329
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,867
We did what you would have
done for either one of us.

330
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,468
So get off your high horse.

331
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,504
Leave the woman alone.

332
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:52,143
We work because I've always
known that I can trust you.

333
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,445
Don't ever go behind
my back again.

334
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,681
You're welcome.

335
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,762
Wait, he called you?

336
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,799
Yeah.
He left a message.

337
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,935
What did he say?

338
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,403
[Sighs]
That...

339
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,938
he wanted to see me.

340
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,840
And what did you do?

341
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,376
Texted him and I told him
I wasn't interested.

342
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,114
Uh...we gotta tell him.

343
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,249
No, we don't.

344
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,383
Yeah, we do.

345
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,151
I'm already
living a lie at work.

346
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,853
I-I can't live one
at home too.

347
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,555
Do you think that if you
told Trevor about us

348
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,056
he's gonna keep
your secret to himself?

349
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,224
I know Trevor.

350
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,892
If I tell him,
he will take it up with me.

351
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,060
If he hears it
from someone else--

352
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,828
- Who's gonna tell him?
- I don't know!

353
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,964
Okay? I just--I know
that he's over there right now,

354
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,033
and it's drilling a hole
in my brain.

355
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,668
Then stay here.

356
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,569
- I can't.
- Why not?

357
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,105
Because he came to me
for help.

358
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:00,778
Okay.

359
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:04,882
Okay what?

360
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,483
Tell him.

361
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,986
But please wait until
he has his life back together.

362
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,388
What do you mean?

363
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,622
He came to you for help.

364
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,858
How much help do you think
hearing about us

365
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,326
is gonna be for him?

366
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,563
Okay.

367
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,564
Okay what?

368
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,399
Okay, I'll stay.

369
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,870
Could you just not
touch anything?

370
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,472
Because, uh...

371
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,374
I like my place just so.

372
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,877
What?
This place is a mess.

373
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,045
What are you...

374
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,080
[Both laugh]

375
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,387
The court finds
sufficient misconduct

376
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,889
to warrant a new trial.

377
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,391
Any pretrial motions
at this time?

378
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,893
Yes, Your Honor.

379
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,294
The state advises
that we will be seeking

380
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,129
the maximum sentence
of life in prison.

381
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,297
What?

382
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,432
Your Honor, my client
has four years left.

383
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,234
Mr. Specter,
the state has every right

384
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,634
to seek that penalty.

385
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,803
Would you like to confer
with your client

386
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,105
before I vacate
his conviction?

387
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,341
You could just withdraw
your motion right now.

388
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,410
I'll confer with my client,
Your Honor.

389
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,050
Get the message?

390
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,624
Four more years.

391
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,394
Or you get out now.

392
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,664
Or stay in
the rest of my life.

393
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,634
September 19, 2007.

394
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,168
What?

395
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,904
His halfway point.

396
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,374
Day I realized
I could make it.

397
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,678
You never said
this could happen.

398
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,679
He's sending a message.

399
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,880
It's got nothing
to do with you.

400
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,315
It's got everything
to do with me.

401
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,316
What do you wanna do?

402
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,118
What do you think?

403
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,321
If we win, I want in.
If we lose, I don't.

404
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,122
We'll win.

405
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,257
How do you know?

406
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,525
Because I know.

407
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,993
Same way you knew
I was guilty?

408
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,264
What do you think?

409
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,666
I think Harvey
wins his cases.

410
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,934
What would you do?

411
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,104
I'd trust him.

412
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,042
Harvey, can you
give us a minute?

413
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,852
[Door shuts]

414
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:25,523
Clifford...

415
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,092
I don't you,
and you don't know me.

416
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:33,197
But I'm gonna tell you a story
about what that man did for me.

417
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,233
And why I think
you should trust him.

418
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,309
Mr. Specter...

419
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,911
Gonna withdraw your motion?

420
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,746
Your Honor, my client
wishes to proceed to trial.

421
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,456
Gensync Chemical.

422
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,524
You dropped this today.

423
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:09,893
Louis's client?

424
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,030
Louis's Fortune 500 client.
You wanna guess why?

425
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:15,299
His ears?
They freak a lot of people out.

426
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,034
That was one client.

427
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:19,170
His teeth?
Fidgeting?

428
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:20,204
Could be anything.

429
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:21,205
All right, stop it.

430
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,440
Let me guess:
One of the board members

431
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:23,707
has a kid
who went to his school.

432
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:24,775
A daughter.

433
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,811
And Lou's correctly
pointed out

434
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,446
that they might not be
the only clients

435
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,980
that will punish us
for taking this case.

436
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:31,448
- Which costs us money.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,184
Louis is in the majority
this time.

438
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:36,053
Which hurts your position
with the partners.

439
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,355
You telling me to crop this?

440
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,425
I'm telling you to win.

441
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,826
But that's not why
I called you in here.

442
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,495
Have a seat.

443
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:50,535
Donna.

444
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,170
Mm-hmm.

445
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,405
You need to get over it.

446
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,407
I'm trying.
It's not that easy.

447
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,409
Yes, it is.

448
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,577
Tell me.

449
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:00,213
Okay.

450
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:02,182
Think about what your life
would be like without her.

451
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:08,356
Now I know.

452
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,490
Know what?

453
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,359
How you always forgive me.

454
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:13,995
Oh, it's nowhere near
as easy to forgive you.

455
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,864
Thank about it.

456
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,699
Oh, I do.

457
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,801
Every goddamn day.

458
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,246
Hey.

459
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,614
Hey.

460
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,915
We're starting trial today.

461
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,750
I know,
you've got five minutes.

462
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:38,852
Never start a trial
without doing our thing.

463
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:40,753
Yeah, well,
you don't have time.

464
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,088
There's plenty of time.

465
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,156
You don't have <i>time.</i>

466
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:50,028
I'm sorry.

467
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,768
For what?

468
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,970
Don't push it.

469
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,738
Okay, let's go.
You got three minutes.

470
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:02,473
Okay, here or in my office?

471
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:03,942
- Here's good.
- Okay, on three.

472
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,076
One, two--

473
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,278
Wait, let's go
in your office.

474
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:07,746
- I'll get the can opener.
- Yeah.

475
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:13,985
You left that
in the kitchen.

476
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,887
Thanks.
I hate it when I do that.

477
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:17,289
You don't have any numbers
in your speed dial.

478
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:18,590
I don't need 'em.

479
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,659
And yet you
forgot your phone.

480
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:22,127
It's not the same thing.

481
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,128
Okay.

482
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:24,696
Hey, Rachel...

483
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,131
Um...

484
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:27,833
thank you for before.

485
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,267
Sure.

486
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:30,802
I mean...

487
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:32,671
it was for Harvey.

488
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,306
Yes.

489
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,674
Hmm.
[Phone ringing]

490
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:43,315
Hey.

491
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,285
Today's your first trial.

492
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,187
What? I've been
to trial before.

493
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,822
Yeah, but not when
you've been with me.

494
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,091
Fair enough.

495
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:54,360
Okay, I wanna start
a ritual with you.

496
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,361
What do you wanna do?

497
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,196
We're on the...

498
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,197
phone.

499
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,666
Remember that gymnastics video

500
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,334
we saw?

501
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,770
Yeah, I can
get behind that.

502
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,208
- Feeling good?
- Never better.

503
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:11,411
- You?
- I'm ready to roll.

504
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:13,146
Don't think I didn't
see that can opener.

505
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:24,023
What do you think you're doing
by opening this case?

506
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,624
I'm making sure
an innocent man

507
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,659
doesn't suffer
for the crimes of others.

508
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,960
And what about Jill?

509
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,829
Don't you care
how she suffered?

510
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,131
You two would know more
about that than anyone, right?

511
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,199
Excuse me.

512
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,901
I bought the devastated friend
act

513
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:37,302
12 years ago.

514
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,604
But I know better now.

515
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:41,407
Mike, meet Jason Black
and Matt Bailey.

516
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:43,042
Just don't
shake their hands.

517
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,210
They've got Jill Hodgkins' blood
all over them.

518
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:46,678
Look, I don't know
what you think you know.

519
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,780
But when I'm done testifying,
the jury's gonna know

520
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,115
that Clifford killed Jill.

521
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,317
Just 'cause
you switched sides,

522
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,219
doesn't mean the rest
of the world did.

523
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:01,026
- We just lost the letter.
- The what?

524
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,061
I didn't realize he'd have
the nerve to lie on the stand.

525
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,663
It's not exactly a giant leap
from killing someone.

526
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,599
Perjury and murder,
they aren't the same thing.

527
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,802
Yeah, murder's worse.

528
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,437
It's easier.
Nobody's watching.

529
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,405
Let's go.

530
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,608
Mr. Black, what exactly
did Jill tell you

531
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,843
regarding the defendant?

532
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:20,712
She told me
she felt trapped.

533
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,313
I thought she was
talking about school,

534
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:25,583
but now I know
what she meant.

535
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:29,120
That letter was dated
a week before she was killed.

536
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:30,588
She must have
broken up with him,

537
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:32,890
and this is how
he paid her back.

538
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:38,096
Mr. Black, you said you didn't
see Jill Hodgkins

539
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,597
at all on the day
of the murder.

540
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:41,065
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

541
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:42,499
So there'd be no reason
for your blood

542
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,202
to be on any of her clothing
at all.

543
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:46,770
No, there'd be no reason.

544
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:49,239
Would you be willing
to have a  DNA test, Mr. Black?

545
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,707
Objection, Your Honor.
Prejudicial.

546
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,309
We'll pay for it,
if that's a problem.

547
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,610
Mr. Specter.

548
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:59,182
It's about the DNA,
and they can't spin that.

549
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,684
Detective Packel,

550
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,053
the dress wasn't the only
article of clothing

551
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,187
that you submitted,
was it?

552
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,356
No, there was a camisole.

553
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,924
Was it in your report?

554
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,659
Yeah, if you bothered
to read it.

555
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:11,994
I did read it, Detective.

556
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:14,730
And what was the DNA analysis
on that camisole?

557
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,065
- I never picked it up.
- Why is that?

558
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,766
Well, it wasn't ready
till two days later

559
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,368
and we already had enough
from the dress.

560
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:21,802
Enough?

561
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:23,070
A man's life is at stake.

562
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,105
Enough for what?

563
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:25,506
Enough for you
to put him away

564
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,274
without bringing it up
for 12 years.

565
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:28,609
Well, I did
pick up that test,

566
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:29,910
along with the camisole.

567
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:32,146
Your Honor, I'd like
to request a side bar.

568
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,280
On what grounds?

569
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:35,683
The camisole and any evidence
connected to it

570
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,718
are inadmissible.

571
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:44,663
This is bullshit.

572
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,498
Easy.
What?

573
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,367
Your Honor, in between

574
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,801
picking up the camisole
at the precinct

575
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,603
and dropping it off
at the lab,

576
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,572
you can see here
the document is flawed.

577
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,040
Therefore, the chain
of possession

578
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:57,608
with respect to the camisole
was broken.

579
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:59,009
You gotta be kidding me.

580
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:01,312
It's inadmissible.

581
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,851
First six.

582
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:07,952
What?

583
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:11,222
First six months
are the hardest.

584
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,291
In your mind.

585
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,197
I don't know if I can
do that again.

586
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:22,002
Mr. Specter, you are
accusing a police officer

587
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:24,037
of tampering with evidence.

588
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,172
Yes, I am.

589
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:27,007
When the results
of the DNA test came back,

590
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,275
they didn't line up,

591
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,744
and Detective Packel
changed the custody documents.

592
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,147
Even if Mr. Specter's
assertions were true,

593
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:34,882
it would automatically
taint the evidence anyway.

594
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,216
He's got a point.

595
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,018
That camisole
was what allowed us

596
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,719
to reopen this case
in the first place.

597
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:42,056
The camisole was proof
that evidence was buried.

598
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,391
That's why the case
was reopened.

599
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,925
An entirely separate issue

600
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,361
from whether that evidence
can be used in this trial.

601
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:49,896
Clifford...

602
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,463
I don't know what's
going on in there,

603
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:54,433
but no matter what they rule,

604
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,035
he's not gonna
lose this one.

605
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:58,570
You sure?

606
00:22:58,604 --> 00:22:59,971
Yeah.

607
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:00,972
I am.

608
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,908
- Your Honor...
- What's enough.

609
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:04,842
I'm instructing the jury
to disregard

610
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,812
all testimony relating
to either the camisole

611
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,714
or the resulting DNA test.

612
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,121
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

613
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:19,058
- Are you okay?
- Get out of my face.

614
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,059
What the hell are you doing,
reopening this?

615
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,461
You worried
about getting caught

616
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:23,562
intentionally
tainting evidence?

617
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:24,864
I didn't taint anything.

618
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:26,498
What I did was help you
put away a guilty man

619
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,501
for brutally killing
a young girl.

620
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:31,003
I'm not gonna let you drag my
reputation through the gutter.

621
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,605
Not without consequences.

622
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,074
Are you threatening me?

623
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,576
'Cause the truth is,
you wouldn't even be here

624
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,311
if you hadn't
done something wrong.

625
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:38,880
Me? Yeah.

626
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,615
That's all well and good
for you to drag up shit

627
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:41,850
from the past, huh?

628
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,118
You're protected by
you shiny suit, right?

629
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:44,619
What are you talking about?

630
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,221
Lawyers never
go after their own.

631
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,123
What is that Denzel movie?

632
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:51,392
"Tell it to me
like I'm a five-year-old."

633
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:53,895
Sometimes, the good guys
gotta do bad things

634
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:55,496
to make the bad guys pay.

635
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,701
It's time to start painting
outside the lines.

636
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,369
How?

637
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,205
If Mohammed won't
come to the mountain,

638
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,474
we need to bring the mountain
to Mohammed.

639
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:10,210
Really?
The mountain to Mohammed.

640
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,879
- It's a thing.
- Yeah, I know.

641
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:14,115
It just has no meaning to me
in this situation.

642
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,217
You said you could
think like me.

643
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:17,386
Figure it out.

644
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,787
Okay, yeah.
I got it.

645
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,656
- What is it?
- You tell me--I'll confirm.

646
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,625
- Nice try.

You come in her with some
unauthorized DNA test and--

you expect me to just release

while these two other

I didn't toss that DNA.

The judge did that
based on fact.

in the first place?

974
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:21,449
I did...
Harvey showed me the results

975
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:22,984
of the DNA test.

976
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:24,018
Two splotches.

977
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,554
Jason Black's and yours.

978
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:28,924
[Exhales]

979
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,426
Okay, um...

980
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:33,362
Uh, I want to file
a report.

981
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:35,631
Oh.

982
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:36,798
Sure.

983
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,099
I'll take you downtown.

984
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,334
You can look
through the books.

985
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:40,702
Maybe you find something.

986
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,803
Maybe you don't.

987
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:43,604
But your real problem
isn't that guy.

988
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,506
It's Jason Black.

989
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,141
Somebody was gonna
turn him in once before.

990
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:50,477
And I think you know
the lengths he'll go to...

991
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,145
to shut somebody up.

992
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:54,514
No, I don't.
No, I don't.

993
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,516
We were here this time.
We won't be here next time.

994
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,684
Next time?
What would have happened

995
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,152
if he would have
killed me this time?

996
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,154
Well, you'd be dead,
and we'd have caught the guy

997
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,323
and used him to put Jason away
for murder.

998
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:04,524
Shit, we should have
done that.

999
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,393
- Yeah.
- Harvey, behave.

1000
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:07,895
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

1001
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:09,096
What do you want
from me?!

1002
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,531
Confess to the crime.

1003
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:11,932
Turn in Jason Black.

1004
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,267
No, I can't do that.

1005
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:14,535
Yes, you can.
I'll tell you why.

1006
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,303
You were 16.

1007
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,371
A juvenile.

1008
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,839
That's three years maximum.

1009
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,174
Less, if you're the one
who comes forward.

1010
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,208
We'll get you a deal.

1011
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,342
No, you can't
make that promise.

1012
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:23,410
You're not the D.A.

1013
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:24,544
You'd rather negotiate
with Jason?

1014
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,412
Because he'll kill you,

1015
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,914
and you know it.

1016
00:38:27,948 --> 00:38:29,682
It was his idea.
I didn't wanna do it.

1017
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:31,784
I didn't
wanna do it.

1018
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:34,520
Okay. Get dressed
and come with me.

1019
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:36,722
Go.

1020
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,491
Hey, by the way,
where'd you get that bruise?

1021

Sometimes the good guys
got to do bad things...

1022
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:43,763
Both: To make
the bad guys pay.

1023
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:44,964
That's right.

[Sighs]

1025
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,202
What?

1026
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:52,471
What? Should have
let me do the talking.

1027
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:53,739
Wouldn't work.
You're not ready yet.

1028
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,975
Not ready?
This whole thing was my idea.

1029
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:57,977
You lost in housing court.

1030
00:38:58,011 --> 00:38:59,579

handle a murderer?

You're welcome.

I let you say
the juvenile thing.

1033
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,151
That was pretty bad-ass,
wasn't it?

1034
00:39:06,454 --> 00:39:08,622
Really?
Thought I nailed it.

Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

I know I shouldn't
be doing this,

1038

and I--I know you're
seeing Jenny,

1039
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,712
but I--I can't stop
thinking about the kiss.

1040
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,715
And...I can't go back.

up and confessed.

We'll get your client out.

I'll back your motion
to expunge his record.

1045
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,463
I'll facilitate his release.

1046
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,867
You don't seem very happy.

1047
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,904
You think I don't know
you set those boys up

1048
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,205
and coerced that whole thing?

1049

Set 'em up?
How would I do that?

1050

I don't know.
What difference does that make?

1051

- I know you did it.
- You know?

1052

The same way you knew
Clifford was guilty?

texting each other?

- You.

Yeah, but they're
not gonna think that.

That's cool.
You'd make a good criminal.

Yeah, better than you.

Okay, that was
a mechanical failure,

have to do this.
