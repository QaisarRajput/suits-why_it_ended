- Donna, the kind of wood you

about my wood.

So tell me, exactly how many
different kinds of wood

have you sampled in your day?
All of them.

Mike,
what can I do for you?

311
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:11,129
You can tell me if you do
straight-up therapy or not.

312
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:14,699
- What's on your mind?
- You didn't answer my question.

313
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:15,933
I didn't think I needed to,

314
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,480
since we've been doing
straight-up therapy

315
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,936
since you got here.

316
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:22,465
So, you want to tell me
what you're here for?

317
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,405
My parents were killed
by a drunk driver when I was 11,

318
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,107
and yesterday I found out that

319
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,075
Kevin almost killed
someone drunk driving.

320
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,077
So I need you to help me
act normal around him,

321
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,313
so that I can get what I need,
so I can get out of here.

322
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:39,759
Oh, well,
that's gonna be a problem.

323
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,961
Because the goal of therapy

324
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:43,330
is not to act normal,
it's to be normal.

325
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,398
Yeah, well, I'll be normal
when I'm home

326
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,845
with the woman I love
instead of dreaming

327
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,202
that the guy I'm sharing a cell
with killed her.

328
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:52,672
- What?
- I had a dream last night

329
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,008
that I didn't have to inform
on Kevin anymore,

330
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,878
because he killed Rachel
in an accident.

331
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,557
And I must have been
talking about it in my sleep,

332
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,314
because he asked me
about it today,

333
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,784
so I told him the accident part,
and then we got in a fight.

334
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,386
- Fight about what?
- I asked him

335
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,755
if he even felt bad
about the guy he hit.

336
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,897
So you turned it
back on him?

337
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,276
What is that even
supposed to mean?

338
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
It means that I think
you picked a fight with Kevin

339
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,614
because you didn't want to think
about why you had that dream.

340
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,071
I know why I had the dream.

341
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,483
It's because he almost
killed someone

342
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,851
the same way
my parents were killed.

343
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,720
No, you had the dream,
because you don't want to deal

344
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,155
with what you're doing
to your friend.

345
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,013
- Oh, this again.
- Yes, this again.

346
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,616
Mike, why do you think part of
the dream was finding out

347
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,784
that you didn't have to inform
on him anymore?

348
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,286
God damn it,
I did not come here

349
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,921
to second guess my decision.

350
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,623
Do you know what?
I don't care.

351
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:38,591
Because I wouldn't be
doing my job,

352
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,594
if I didn't inform you
that actions have consequences,

353
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,829
and you seem to think that

354
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:44,497
the only consequence
of what you're doing

355
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,643
is getting out of here early,
but it's not.

356
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:50,011
I think you don't know shit
about what I've been through.

357
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:53,014
It's a mistake coming
to you for help.

358
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,959
And this is the fifth bedroom,
and I'm completely open

359
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,860
to you knocking down walls
or removing windows,

360
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,596
by the way.
No, I love the windows.

361
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:05,976
They let in so much light.
I agree.

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,766
We should add a wall of glass.
What do

363
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,401
I think the place
is beautiful,

364
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:11,403
and I appreciate you bringing
these photos over,

365
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:15,674
but when can we
go see it in person?

366
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,107
- In person?
- Yes, of course.

367
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,975
I need to see the space before
I can start drafting anything.

368
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,877
I was just thinking we could
work closer together

369
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,856
for the next 60 to 90 days
before you started that.

370
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,625
- That wouldn't be productive.
- But I couldn't possibly

371
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,593
make it out there in less than
seven to ten business days.

372
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,783
That's too bad.

373
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,563
I was gonna be out there
the day after tomorrow.

374
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:32,831
I was thinking
we could see the space,

375
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,287
and then maybe go have lunch.

376
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:38,025
Lunch?
Together?

377
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,927
Well, I wasn't thinking of
eating in separate restaurants.

378

Ha!
Of course you weren't.

Day after tomorrow's perfect.

00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:46,513
- But I thought you couldn't--
- I can, and I will,

00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:48,048
and I will meet you
at my ancestral home,

- That's right.

617
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:31,230
The firm that I work for
is taking your case.

618
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:39,347
After all this time.

619
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:41,983
Thank you.

620
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:44,552
You're welcome.

621
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,988
But we still need
to get the case reopened,

622
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:50,425
and to do that we need
to find something new.

623
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,968
So where do we get that?

624
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,612
I was going through
the state's case file,

625
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,403
and I read your police report.

626
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,371
You said there was a woman
with you that night

627
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,620
who can testify that you didn't
kill that couple.

628
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,555
That's right, Maria,
but that's not new.

629
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,430
Well, it's new as far
as the court's concerned,

630
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,730
because it was never
admitted at trial.

631
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,897
- Well, let's admit it.
- It's not that easy.

632
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,710
I need to understand
why it was never admitted.

633
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:16,770
Because the damn woman up
and disappeared before my trial.

634
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,471
My lawyer didn't do a thing.

635
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,073
You had an alibi witness,

636
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,748
and your public defender
let her get away.

637
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,076
That's what I've been saying.

638
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,178
Maria could have told the jury
that I didn't do it,

639
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:26,746
instead no one told them.

640
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,315
Two weeks later,
I'm in here,

641
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,518
and I've been here
ever since.

642
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:35,522
Is there anything else
I need to know?

643
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,724
Then I need to find
Maria Gomez.

644
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,801
Look, man, please,
I really don't want to talk.

645
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:51,337
Good, 'cause
I want you to listen.

646
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:59,211
When I was a kid,
I thought we had it good.

647
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:01,847
And we did. Had a nice house,
nice neighborhood.

648
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:05,081
Except for one thing.

649
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:08,217
Turns out my father...

650
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:09,886
was a criminal.

651
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,117
One day he got caught.
He went to prison.

652
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,353
My whole life fell apart.

653
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,989
How old were you?

654
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,458
15.

655
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,260
I'll tell you something.

656
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,330
I hated that man for doing
what he did to me,

657
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,633
so I did what messed up
15-year-olds do.

658
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:31,137
- Started acting out.
- Acting out?

659
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:37,057
Brother, I was on my way
to a place worse than this.

660
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,392
Finally, my mom made me
see someone,

661
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,595
and he helped me realize

662
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,499
that if I didn't change,
I was gonna ruin my life.

663
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:48,201
So I straightened out
and turned my life around.

664
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:50,663
And that's why you do
what you do.

665
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,033
Yeah.

666
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,068
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because the way

667
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:59,772
that man got through to me
was to open up about himself,

668
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:03,209
and I realized that if
I really want to help you,

669
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,644
I got to do the same.

a look at these.

677
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:22,513
- What is it?
- Cahill issued subpoenas

678

to deposition William Sutter
and Kevin Miller.

679

- That sneaky son of a bitch.
- Why are you smiling?

Because last night
I went to Cahill

681
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:31,823
and tried to give him
Sutter's trading program.

682
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,623
- You did what?
- It was the only way

683
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,992
I could see to stop the case
from getting dismissed,

but he wouldn't take it.

685
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,108
And this buys you time.

686
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:41,377
It does, if the judge
waits to rule on our motion

687
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:44,046
until after Cahill conducts
these depositions.

688
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:46,160
Harvey, even if that works,
what if Cahill doesn't get

689
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,162
enough from the depositions
to keep the case alive?

690
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,064
Then Mike's chance of getting
out of prison is gone,

691
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:51,721
which means Cahill's
not the only one

692
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:54,924
that needs to use this
to try and get something.

693
00:25:57,838 --> 00:25:59,504
I have to admit, Ms. Zane,
when you said

694
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,778
you were looking into the Bailey
case, my interest was piqued.

695
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:04,002
That was a long time ago.

696
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:05,482
Well, you've obviously
come a long way

697
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,272
since your public defender days.

698
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:10,408
You don't exactly see the best
of humanity at that job,

699
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,911
which makes it one
you can only do for so long.

700
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,247
But you didn't come here
to be my therapist.

701
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,316
No, I came to talk
about Maria Gomez.

702
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:19,551
What about her?

703
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,620
I'm curious as to how you
can have an alibi witness

704
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:22,621
on a murder case,

705
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,096
and your client ends up
on death row.

706
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:26,103
Because I didn't have
an alibi witness.

707
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,971
I had a no-show
who vanished into thin air,

708
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:30,150
and I didn't have the resources
to find her.

709
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,250
And you didn't think
to ask the police at trial

710
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:34,252
why they didn't follow up
on Leonard's alibi?

711
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:35,386
I did think of it,

712
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,966
and they would have said
what they always say,

713
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,101
"Every murderer claims
to have an alibi,"

714
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,235
and if I couldn't produce her,
why should they?

715
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,814
Well, you could have
at least asked for postponement,

716
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,071
to have time to find her.

717
00:26:44,106 --> 00:26:45,739
And I would have,
except for one thing.

718
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:48,075
I wasn't sure a drug addict
with a prior conviction

719
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,310
would have done
Leonard Bailey much good.

720
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,855
That's about her character,
not the facts of the case.

721
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,224
Her character is
a fact of the case,

722
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:56,670
and when I pressed her
as to what the two of them

723
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:58,105
were doing at the time
of those murders,

724
00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:00,096
she admitted they were
both on meth,

725
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:01,564
and it wasn't the first time.

726
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,599
Which, by the way,
might have something to do with

727
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:06,068
why she never
showed up at trial.

728
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:09,450
So you can try to reopen
this case if you want, Ms. Zane,

729
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:13,854

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,315
That was supposed
to be six years ago,

1082
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,950
but then the state
teacher's pension fund

1083
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:48,387
decided to invest its money
with William Sutter.

1084
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,761
She died last year,
still working.

1085
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:57,107
And every year,
I tried to pay for her trip,

1086
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:59,165
but she just wouldn't let me.

1087
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,434
Sean, why are you
telling me this?

1088
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:03,769
Because a judge decided
to rule on your motion

1089
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:06,272
to dismiss after all.

1090
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:08,274
Which means
we're out of time,

1091
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:13,045
and you didn't just come here
to tell me about your mother.

1092
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:14,947
No.

1093
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:18,150
I came here to ask
for that trading program.

1094
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:21,354
