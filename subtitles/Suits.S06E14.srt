<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:02,063
It's a no.

3
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:03,305
I thought you liked the idea.

4
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:04,530
That was before I realized

5
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:06,431
that it was nothing but
sassy remarks.

6
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,178
I thought you wanted our baby
to have a relationship

7
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,168
with its biological father.
If you're gonna get

8
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:13,939
this worked up, it makes me
think I don't really know you.

9
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,285
What if I could make it
more like you?

10
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:16,753
I might be able
to give it the ability

11
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,355
to learn from your heart.
You really think

12
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:20,012
we could do that?
We can try.

13
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:22,147
Rachel Zane deserves to be
in the Bar.

14
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,016
You're not only gonna
stop blocking her,

15
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:26,585
you're gonna run interference
for her if someone else does.

16
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,253
And in return,
you'll do what I want.

17
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:30,789
No, but I'll do what you want
for something else.

18
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:32,102
We need to come up
with a lawsuit

19
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:33,992
against Velocity Data Solutions.
No.

20
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,639
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Fabricating a lawsuit

21
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:37,262
to manipulate a stock
is illegal.

22
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,264
It's not illegal if we find
a legitimate suit.

23
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,444
Let's finish the job and get you
back to being a lawyer.

24
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,535
"Tenants are required
to be notified

25
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,937
of all construction
by certified letter."

26
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:47,839
Is this a certified letter
or not?

27
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,074
- Objection.
- Your Honor,

28
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,109
this is the fraudulent attorney.
Open your mouth

29
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,111
in my courtroom again
and you will be removed.

30
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:55,180
Mr. Grady, do you have
an objection or not?

31
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,948
- I don't.
- Then the court has no choice

32
00:00:56,984 --> 00:01:00,218
but to dismiss this case
with prejudice.

33
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,187
The guy holding up your
interview was trying

34
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,589
to get us to do something
because he thought he could.

35
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,159
- Are you going to?
- Yes.

36
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,627
He is.
Are you saying

37
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:11,563
what I think you're saying?
I'm in.

38
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,701
Okay, Rachel's gone.

39
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,113
I don't want any bullshit.
You're telling me

40
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:18,503
that no matter what we do,

41
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,038
Rachel's getting into the Bar?

42
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,374
What I'm telling you is
if she doesn't get in,

43
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,243
that asshole isn't gonna be
the one that stopped her.

44
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:30,449
Okay. I'm in.

45
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,484
What do we have to do?

46
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,297
I told you what we need to do.
We need to make a dent

47
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,988
in Velocity Data's stock.
Harvey, that's no joke.

48
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,735
You realize how much we're gonna
have to sue them for

49
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,070
to make their earnings
take a hit?

50
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:41,094
You're damn right I do.

51
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:43,428
They're a huge company,
which means

52
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:44,507
it's got to be something huge.

53
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:45,709
I don't even know
if that matters.

54
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:46,843
No matter what we sue them for,

55
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:47,911
they're just gonna
want to settle.

56
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:49,768
I know that.
Which means we need to insist

57
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,570
on an admission of guilt.

58
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:54,005
I get it.

59
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,086
You want me to run this whole
thing through the clinic.

60
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,044
It's the only way to make it
look legitimate.

61
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,547
Harvey, I don't know if I can
convince Nathan to do that.

62
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,716
Well, you better,
because if anyone figures out

63
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,651
that we're doing this
for personal gain,

64
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:09,554
your chance of
getting into the bar is gone.

65
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:17,529
Wait, you were Captain
of the Glee Club?

66
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:18,942
The official title
is Lieutenant Colonel,

67
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,043
but that's cool
you didn't know that.

68
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,334
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:26,238
Oh, my God. You still
had braces at 17.

70
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,774
Actually, I had them again
at 28.

71
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:30,108
Wow.

72
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:33,612
Between this,
your nasal passages,

73
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,847
the skin tag epidemic
and the foot surgeries,

74
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:37,749
you really had a lot
of medical procedures.

75
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:39,229
Tara, I know what you
must be thinking

76
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:40,986
and I swear,

77
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,988
I will not pass any of my
maladies onto our child.

78
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,657
Louis,
I wasn't thinking that,

79
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,926
but you do understand
that biologically

80
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,028
this isn't your child.
Of course I do.

81
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,930
Okay.

82
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,176
But I was thinking
we would have at least

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
one child of our own.

84
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,469
At least?

85
00:02:57,504 --> 00:03:00,105
At least.

86
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,106
You were right, Louis.

87
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,575
Getting to know each other
is fun.

Is this about the worker comp

No, this is about
Velocity Data Solutions.

93
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,025
- What about them?
- They're a dirty company.

94
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,805
They've been getting away
with shit for years.

95
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,840
I could never go after them
when I worked at Pearson Specter

96
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,742
because we were always on
the other side of these things,

97

but I can go after them now.

Mike, if this is going
to require me going to court--

99
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:34,239
It's not.

100
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:39,010
Look, Oliver, I know
what happened the other day.

101

But you don't have to be a trial
lawyer to be a great lawyer.

- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that you have

103
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,183
skills that
other lawyers don't have

104
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,620
and I'm gonna put those skills
to use right now.

105
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,389
- What do you need?
- You see those boxes?

106
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:54,059
That's every case that Velocity
has settled in the last 20 years

107
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:55,872
where the names of
the plaintiffs have been sealed.

108
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,596
We need to figure out
who those people are,

109
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:59,471
what they got paid not to say,
and then we need

110
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:02,434
to get every damn one of them
to come forward.

111
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,069
Mike, what did
these guys do to you?

112
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,481
They didn't do anything
to me, Oliver.

113
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:06,883
I just don't like it when
people think they can get away

114
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:09,341
with anything just because
nobody is watching.

115
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,514
- That was fast.
- What was fast?

116
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,515
Well, I assume you're here
to tell me

117
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,884
you filed suit against Velocity.

118
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,752
What I'm here
to tell you, Craig,

119
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:22,821
is Mike Ross
is gonna handle Velocity.

120
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,634
Then we have a problem,
'cause I didn't cut a deal

121
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:26,102
with Mike Ross.
I cut a deal with you.

122
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,093
And there's a reason
you're an in-house counsel

123
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,295
and I'm not.
What are you talking about?

124
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,163
Once we drop
whatever bomb we're gonna drop,

125
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,377
they're gonna want to settle
without an admission of guilt

126
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,668
and everyone knows
settling is what I do.

127
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,637
So Mike Ross is gonna
take this to court?

128
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:39,905
He's not even
a goddamn lawyer.

129
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,606
Welcome to the conversation,
Craig.

130
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:42,819
That's what I'm here
to talk about.

131
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:44,876
You're gonna make
Mike's hearing official.

132
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,578
I can't do that,
it's too soon.

133
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:47,853
Bullshit.
You think I don't know

134
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,081
you only said yes about Mike
to get me to help you?

135
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:52,050
Of course that's why
I said yes.

136
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,963
And the hardest thing about
getting him into the Bar

137
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:56,499
is getting him a hearing when he
hasn't even gone to law school.

138
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,390
Which is why you're
gonna sponsor him

139
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,525
based on his years
of work at Pearson Specter.

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,060
You're talking about
reading the law.

141
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,061
You're damn right I am.

142
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,330
There's precedent
and you know it.

143
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,300
Listen to me,
I can influence the vote,

144
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:10,635
but I cannot sponsor someone
I'm going to be voting on.

145
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,003
Then find someone who will.

146
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,917
Because if you can't get him
a hearing in the next week,

147
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:14,906
this thing is off.

148
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,241
And one more thing, Craig.

149
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:17,943
You and I won't be
talking again

150
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:19,844
because in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

151
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,479
this is a hell of a lot
more serious

152
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,548
than cheating on your wife.

Harvey, what are you
doing in here?

165
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:08,026
What do you mean?
It's an executive kitchen.

166
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm an executive.
Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.

167
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,493
This place is like
croissant central.

168
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,317
Then maybe I just came in here

169
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,185
hoping to spend some
quality time with you.

170
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,065
Are you saying you want to
hear about my night with Tara?

171
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,188
Of course I do.

172
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,601
Right after we make friendship
bracelets

173
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,292
and braid each other's hair.

174
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:24,460
For your information,
it was a magical evening,

175
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,007
but actually,
I'm here to talk business.

176
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,697
- What business?
- Couture Apparel.

177
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,366
Jessica and I always gave
their CEO an annual analysis

178
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,779
of their legal needs
for the upcoming year--

179
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,603
And now that she's gone,
you want us to do it?

180
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:34,604
Exactly.

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,972
Sounds like
a dog and pony show.

182
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:38,241
It is more than that, Harvey.
It is a show of force.

183
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,276
For one day, Carly Donahue
needs to feel like

184
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,178
the most important client
in the portfolio.

185
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:44,681
And having one partner
go by himself

186
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:46,516
doesn't send that message.
Louis, relax.

187
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,917
I'm happy to do it.
You are?

188
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,920
Of course I am.
I told you, we're partners.

189
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:54,057
You know, Harvey, I always
dreamed it could be like this.

190
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:56,259
Partners, confidantes,
friends

191
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,860
I had the exact
same dream, Louis.

192
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,762
- Really?
- No, not really.

193
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:01,208
Does that mean you're never
gonna go mudding with me?

194
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,833
Yes, Louis,
that's what it means.

195
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,802
I'll give Donna the details
on that meeting.

196
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,575
Hey, I hope you got a hammer,

197
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,177
'cause I just brought you
some nails.

198
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,845
- You found something?
- Yeah, I did.

199
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,480
I already found six
cases we can use,

200
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:18,960
and that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

201
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,184
So let's grab our coats
and go kick Velocity's ass

202
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,052
up and down the street.
Easy, Tyson.

203
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,966
You have to tell me
what kind of suits these are.

204
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,901
They're mining suits,
which means health problems

205
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,858
or corporate negligence--
Either way, the damages

206
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,093
could be through the roof.

207
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,862
Oliver, this is great.

208
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:36,065
I know. And if you asked me
to make an argument

209
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,468
about it in court,
I'd probably shit the bed.

210
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,314
But, Mike, I'm telling you,
there's something here.

211
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:42,405
And I'm telling you,
maybe one day you'll overcome

212
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,773
your court stuff,
maybe you won't.

213
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:48,311
Either way, this proves that
you're a hell of a lawyer.

214
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,580
Yeah, thanks, Mike.
I gotta admit,

215
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,782
it feels pretty good to know
I can do what I just did.

216
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,095
Then why don't you start
drafting a suit.

217
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,496
'Cause after I get these
people on board,

218
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,688
that's exactly
what we're gonna have to do.

219
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,462
Donna,
you're never gonna believe

220
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,131
what Louis just asked me.

221
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,499
<i>The Donna:</i>
<i>Give me three guesses.</i>

222

<i>He wants to look like you.</i>

<i>as a body suit.</i>

224
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,672
Okay, did you just talk
without saying anything?

225
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,418
What's the big deal?
You do it all the time.

226
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,375
<i>The Donna: Good one, Donna.</i>
<i>You're on fire today.</i>

227
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,277
Okay, what the hell's
going on here?

228
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,680
Oh, you mean The Donna?
It's just a little product

229
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:25,415
that Benjamin and I
have been working on.

230
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,194
It doesn't have my emotional
intelligence yet

231
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:29,719
but I thought I'd have a little
fun with it in the meantime.

232
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,422
Do you have your emotional
intelligence yet?

233
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,557
When it can top that,
you might have something.

234
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:38,327
<i>The Donna: Loser.</i>

235
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:42,031
Okay, which one of you
said that?

236
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,232
both: She did.

237
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,375
Sorry, buddy.
Grill's shut down.

238
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,177
We don't open again till five.

239
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,512
That's okay.
I'm not here for a cheeseburger.

240
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:00,116
I'm here to talk about
Hazelton Mining Company.

241
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,018
- What about it?
- You filed a complaint

242
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,564
alleging life-threatening
health problems

243
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:06,189
resulting from work.

244
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,824
That complaint mysteriously
went away

245
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:10,037
and I want to help you get the
compensation that you deserve.

246
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:12,295
I don't need any help
from an ambulance chaser.

247
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,664
I'm not an ambulance chaser,
Mr. Stamos.

248
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,599
My name is Mike Ross,
I work at a clinic

249
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,768
and our commissions are capped
at $50,000.

250
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,737
So we are not in this
for the money.

251
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,438
Then what are you in it for?

252
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,407
Let's just say
Velocity is bad news,

253
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,875
Well, I'd like to help,

254
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,779
but even if I wanted to sue
those bastards, I can't.

255
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:31,981
I know.
You took a payout

256
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,494
and you signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

257
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:34,917
That's got nothing
to do with it.

258
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,986
They made us
all sign those things.

259
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,288
If any one of us breaks it,
it negates them all.

260
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,624
Then negate them all.

261
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,460
That's easy for you to say.

262
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,764
I'm dying of something
with a name so long,

263
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,566
I can't even tell you
what it is.

264
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,635
And you're talking about
your fee being capped

265
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,103
at more money
than they paid me.

266
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:56,172
Listen to me, if that's really
all they paid you,

267
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:59,108
and you really are dying,
we can shatter those NDAs

268
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:03,012
in about five seconds.

269
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:06,716
You don't understand.

270
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:09,952
I was their supervisor,
Mr. Ross.

271
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:13,689
I was responsible
for all those guys that got sick

272
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,424
and I'm the one that
got us the money

273
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,361
that went with those NDAs.

274
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:20,363
And let me guess:

275
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,531
ever since you signed them,

276
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,299
you haven't had
a good night's sleep.

277
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,337
Tell me I'm wrong,
I'll leave right now.

278

00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,242
that you will pull the plug
on this whole thing.

308
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,878
- Rachel--
- Harvey, I want your word.

309
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,616
You got it.

310
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,684
Thing go south, it's done.

311
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:59,262
- Hey, Mike, you got a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

312
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,663
I was hoping you could
tell me.

313
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,676
Apparently Oliver was in
the conference room all day

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,801
working on some case
against Velocity Data.

315
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,637
Uh, yeah,
I gave him an assignment.

316
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,450
What do you mean
you "gave him an assignment"?

317
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:11,274
He had the workers comp case.

318
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:13,075
I took care of that.

319
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,344
Mike, your job isn't
to generate cases.

320
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,680
It's to consult on the cases
we've already taken.

321
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:18,993
I know that,
but it's also to help

322
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:21,684
our associates
become better lawyers.

323
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,530
Oliver got his ass kicked
in court the other day.

324
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:24,865
I'm just helping
to build him back up.

325
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:25,855
And there are plenty
of other cases

326
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,001
you could've used to do that.

327
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,958
Instead, you went
and you signed a class action,

328
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,593
which is something we do not do.

329
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:32,461
Well, why isn't it
something we do?

330
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,337
These men have life-threatening
health problems

331
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:35,910
They need someone
to give a shit about them.

332
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,111
It isn't something we do
because we don't have

333
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,001
the time or the man power
to take on

334
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,871
a giant like Velocity.

335
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,874
Nathan, I don't know
what you want me to say.

336
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:47,343
I went out there, I signed
these guys and they trusted me.

337
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:49,845
I can't back out now.

338
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:50,846
This the kinda shit you pulled

339
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,416
when you were
at Pearson Specter?

340
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,750
On occasion.

341
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,996
Then I want you to say
the next time you think

342
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,687
to pull something like this,

343
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:01,524
you have the common courtesy
to tell me before you do it.

344

And for your information,
the initial program

350
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,273
was vanilla bean
and an Enya CD,

351
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,075
but it learned from you.

352
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,176
Pretty awesome, right?

353
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,178
No, Benjamin,
it's not pretty awesome.

354
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,746
You can't just give it
platitudes.

355
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:26,859
What are you talking about?

356
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,523
The key to having empathy
is making people

357
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,150
feel supported
in their feelings,

358
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,419
not just trying to solve
their problems.

359
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:33,699
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

360
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,489
No, it isn't.
And not only that,

361
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,957
you have to tailor
its response

362
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,726
to the feelings the person
is having.

363
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:39,994
How am I supposed to do that?

364
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,163
You have to have it listen.

365
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,476
Okay, I get it.
You're saying it has to

366
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,233
understand the feelings
of its user,

367
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,069
and express that understanding
in a sympathetic manner.

368
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,538
Exactly. Now, you think you
can do that?

369
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,340
Of course I can.
All I need to do

370
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,287
is continually expose it
to what it's not providing

371
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,922
and eventually
the feedback loop will show it

372
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:57,912
how to be more like you.

373
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:59,647
In other words, awesome.

374
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,193
Yes, that's the entire point
of this exercise.

375
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,050
And for the record,

376
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,353
no one awesome listens to Enya.

377
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,355
Well maybe not her later work.

378
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:16,263
You're the whole team?

379
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,365
Seems fair.
There's only one of you.

380
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,478
I'm not an attorney,
Mr. Ross.

381
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,236
I'm CEO.
Then you must be serious.

382
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,315
Why don't you give me
a number?

383
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,472
You want a number?
Zero.

384
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:27,775
'Cause I'm not gonna be
shaken down by the likes of you.

385
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,910
This isn't a shakedown,
Mr. Palmer.

386
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:31,378
Those men are dying
from conditions

387
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,047
that your company knew about.

388
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,649
Those men signed
non-disclosure agreements.

389
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,818
And if they break them,
we can come after them

390
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,331
for every penny they got.
And I've got a way

391
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,055
to bust every damn one
of those agreements.

392
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,756
No way, those things
are airtight.

393
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,725
Airtight doesn't apply
when signed under duress,

394
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,493
which is exactly what
dying of lung cancer

395
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,495
and not being able to afford
a doctor is.

396
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:50,898
Well good luck making
that argument a thousand times,

397
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,711
because I'm gonna fight
each and every one of them

398
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,179
to my dying breath.
You can't do that,

399
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,438
they're a class.
I can and I will.

400
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,684
And you move forward with this,

401
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,252
I'm gonna bury
that shit-hole legal clinic

402
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:05,612
of yours in so much paperwork,
you're going to choke to death.

403
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,082
So you just called me down
here to tell me no to my face?

404
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,394
I called you down here
to show you that if

405
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,296
you pursue this action,
those men are going to be

406
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,822
left with nothing
and so are you.

407
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,326
That's a hell of a strategy,

408
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,505
but I guess you didn't
get the memo

409
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,031
that my co-counsel on this
is Pearson Specter Litt.

410
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,533
Bullshit. Their name's not on
any one of these documents.

411
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:28,146
'Cause they wanted to keep
a low profile,

412
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,072
but go ahead, pick up the phone.
I'll call them myself.

413
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:35,342
Then I guess I'll see you
and your big law firm in court.

414
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,344
Because like I said,

415
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,481
I'm not gonna be shaken down
by the likes of you.

416
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:49,790
Harvey,
I just got a phone call

417
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,792
from the lawyers at Velocity,

418
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,205
They wanted me to confirm that
we're co-counsel

419
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,095
with Mike on this.
What'd you tell them?

420
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,708
What do you think I told them?
I told them yes.

421
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,410
Because if they're asking,
he obviously bluffed

422
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,068
and I'm not gonna hang him
out to dry.

423
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,447
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find out

424
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,506
what he did
and why he did it.

425
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,590
- What the hell did you do?
- Relax, Harvey,

426
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,458
I was just coming to tell you--
No, I specifically

427
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:15,427
said that I can't be seen
to be involved in this thing.

428
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:17,418
And you also said we only had
one shot at this.

429
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:18,797
I was the one in the room
with this guy.

430
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:20,621
He had me and he knew it.
So what?

431
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:21,933
So you always said that
if I'm in a knife fight

432
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,257
and I'm losing,
to pick up a gun.

433
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,793
And Pearson Specter Litt
is a goddamn gun.

434
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,728
Look, I know this isn't
exactly what we wanted,

435
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,875
but I can still be the one to
insist on an admission of guilt,

436
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,799
so what's really going on here?

437
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,101
I promised Rachel
that if this thing got too risky

438
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,703
I'd pull the plug, and it just
got a hell of a lot riskier.

439
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,539
Well, it also got real.

440
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,741
Those miners need us.

441
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:44,344
I'm not going to
abandon them, so...

442
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,847
what do you wanna do?

443
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,848
What do you think
I want to do?

444
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,450
I wanna kick this guy's ass.

445
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,885
Then here's the situation:
I got a 150 miners on board

446
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,087
and I can bust the NDAs.

447
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:54,266
But I can't make
the action a class

448
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,700
'cause they already
signed those rights away.

449
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,524
I get it.
He doesn't think

450
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,626
we can get all those
separate cases to court.

451
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:01,595
Well, he's got
another thing coming.

452
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,031
I got ten brand-new
associates upstairs

453
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,632
begging to work
on a case like this.

454
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:07,401
You're gonna oversee
every single one them

455
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:08,947
if it takes all night.
Then I have to meet you

456
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,471
at your office in an hour.

457
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,273
Something I need to
take care of first.

458
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,759
Louis, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

459
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:21,927
No, this'll just
take a second.

460
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,228
It's about
the Carly Donahue meeting.

461
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,918
I was thinking--
Louis, I'm sorry,

462
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,553
but I'm not gonna
be able to make it.

463
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,957
- What? Why the hell not?
- Mike needs my help on a case.

464
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:31,169
Harvey, you may not want
to accept this,

465
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:32,759
but Mike doesn't
work here anymore.

466
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,428
and firm business takes
priority over--

467
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,231
Listen, Louis,
this is firm business

468
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,566
and if what I think
is gonna happen happens,

469
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,735
Mike's gonna end up
back here when it's done.

470
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,070
- What?
- You remember that thing

471
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,438
that we took care of for Rachel

472
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:46,039
that you said might
be worth doing?

473
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:48,308
Well, it turns out
it was worth doing.

474
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:49,910
Only I'm doing it for Mike.

475
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,879
Holy shit. Seidel agreed
to go to bat for him?

476
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:54,114
Yes, and once it's done
and Mike's in the Bar,

477
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,049
he can come back here
and work again.

478
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,384
Harvey, that is great

479
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,319
and nobody wants that
more than I do,

480
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,221
but it's just one meeting.
Louis, I know that,

481
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,201
but in about three hours,
I'm gonna be under water

482
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,858
for the next three days.
Harvey--

483
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,828
Louis, I know I told you
I'd be there for you,

484
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:11,932
but I need you
to be there for me.

485
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,767
Okay, Harvey,
I'll do it.

486
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,983
Good, you're still here.
Box up the Velocity files

487
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,663
and meet me downstairs.
Where are we going?

488
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:33,331
Pearson Specter agreed
to partner up on the case.

489
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,821
- Shit, that's big.
- Want in?

490
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,524
Hell yeah.
Give me ten minutes.

491
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,760
- Hey.
- Yeah?

492
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,028
You wanna tell me
what this is?

493
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,696
That is an agreement
to co-counsel

494
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,209
and I was just gonna come
tell you about it.

495
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,577
How many times are you gonna
make a move without telling me?

496
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,467
Nathan, I'm sorry,
but I had to move fast.

497
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,404
The guy at Velocity was
putting the screws to me.

498
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,172
Is something shady
going on here, Mike?

499
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,173
- What?
- First you bring in

500
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:54,575
this huge case out of the blue.

501
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,388
Then all of sudden, you're
bringing in your old firm.

502
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:57,789
You're the one who said we
didn't have the resources

503
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:58,779
to handle this sort of thing,

504
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,292
so I just brought in
someone who would.

505
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:01,526
Yeah, and I bet they're
getting a sweet deal out of it.

506
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,616
It's not like that.

507
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,184
They're taking
half their usual fee.

508
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,264
That's all they're getting.
And what about you, Mike?

509
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:08,099
What are you getting?
What are you talking about?

510
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,401
You're gonna tell me
you're not using this

511
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,069
as a stepping stone
to get back to your old firm?

512
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,026
What? No, Nathan,
I don't want to go back there.

513
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:14,172
Bullshit.
I don't believe you.

514
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,096
Something is going on here
and I know it.

515
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:19,132
You know what, Nathan?

516
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,602
For your information,
Harvey Specter did offer me

517
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:23,136
a consulting job
just like you did,

518
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,105
except his had one more zero
at the end of it,

519
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,341
and I still turned him down.

520
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:31,845
I chose to be here,

521
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,692
but I don't want to be
second-guessed at every turn.

522
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:35,026
So either you're gonna trust
that my heart

523
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,219
is in the right place
or you're not.

524
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:41,722
Well, for your
information, Mike,

525
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,890
right now I really
don't have a choice.

526
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:05,743
- Hey, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

527
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,756
How the hell am I supposed
to keep Carly Donahue's business

528
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,580
all by myself?
Because, Louis,

529
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:11,994
you're co-managing partner
and you're one hell of a lawyer.

530
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,884
Oh, you just don't
get it, do you?

531
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,821
This woman wants to know
that she's special to this firm.

532
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:18,367
If I walk in there by myself,
she's gonna

533
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,802
laugh me out of the room.
Then why didn't you

534
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,258
tell that to Harvey?
Because I know

535
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,426
how important Mike is to him

536
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,861
and I didn't want to
let him down.

537
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,940
- Then don't.
- That is not--

538
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,241
Louis, if this woman
needs to know

539
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,065
she's special to us,
there's more than one way

540
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,079
to do it and Harvey's
not the only one you can bring.

541
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,580
Donna, that's great.
But this meeting is tomorrow

542
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,115
and I don't even know
these new associates yet.

543
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:34,805
Yes, you do.
You know Katrina,

544
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:37,108
who's not just a new associate,
she's a Junior Partner

545
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:40,077
and you know Rachel,
who's as good as a fourth-year.

546
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,946
You go there with
a show of force like that,

547
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:46,751
trust me, this woman
is gonna be blown away.

548
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:50,454
Okay, Donna.
Show of force it is.

549
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:54,358
Holy shit,
Otis Redding's first album?

550
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:56,227
You sure Harvey won't mind
if I take it out?

551
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:57,595
Are you kidding me?

552
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,475
No, he says if that collection's
not for everyone,

553
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,076
then what's the point
of even having it here?

554
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,267
- Sounds like a great guy.
- The best.

555
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,236
Ghandi. Harvey.

556
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,904
- You serious?
- Hand to God.

557
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,240
Man's practically a saint.

558
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,409
- What's going on?
- Oliver, Harvey Specter.

559
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,044
Harvey Specter, Oliver.

560
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,612
Nice to meet you, Oliver.

561
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,114
Would you like me
to pour you a drink?

562
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,949
- Would you?
- No, I wouldn't.

563
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,152
Now put that down,
get out of my office

564
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:22,965
and if I ever catch you
touching one of my things again,

565
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,923
I'll shove it up your ass.
Is he serious?

566
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:30,227
Oh, not about the ass part,
but I'd put it back.

567
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:31,996
- You set me up.
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,632
Welcome to
Pearson Specter Litt.

569
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,134
[laughs] You enjoy that?

570
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,670
- Yeah, it felt okay.
- Good. Now why don't you go

571
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,473
make sure everyone knows exactly
what they're doing

572
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:43,941
It's 9:00 p.m.,
the clock's ticking

573
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:45,576
and we gotta
get this thing done.

574
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,056
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

575
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,991
what we're going to say
to that Velocity son of a bitch

576
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:52,183
when he walks in here tomorrow
begging for a settlement.

577
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,553
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

578
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,288
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

579
00:21:57,323 --> 00:22:00,124
Gretchen said that Louis had
some special assignment for us.

580
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,926
All I know is I got
a rambling voicemail

581
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,495
- about Neapolitan ice cream.
- Neapolitan ice cream?

582
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,564
Yes.
Chocolate and vanilla

583
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,432
melded beautifully
with strawberry.

584
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,401
Just like we're about to do
for Carly Donahue.

585
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,847
Louis, did you just
call me chocolate?

586
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,315
Why would I do that?
You're my white swan,

587
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:15,084
Katrina's my black swan.
The math ain't that hard.

588
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:16,841
What's with the boxes, Louis?

589
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,609
This is everything
the firm has ever done

590
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:19,710
for Couture Apparel.

591
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:21,345
You're taking us
to your annual meeting?

592
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,546
I'm not just taking you.

593
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,181
We're running it together.
Okay, Louis--

594
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,527
I know what you're thinking.
How the hell

595
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,329
are a Junior Partner
and a third-year law student

596
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:29,153
supposed to
fill Jessica's size 13s?

597
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:31,055
Well the answer is:
you can't.

598
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,823
No one can.
Then why are we here?

599
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,326
Because we used to
dazzle Carly with rank.

600
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:38,195
This year, we're gonna
dazzle her with substance.

601
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,397
By knowing her business
better than anyone else.

602
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,633
I'll take care of
the business.

603
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,868
What you two are gonna do
is personally tailor

604
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,736
the presentation to her.

605
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,372
And as of now, we have
less than 24 hours to do that.

606
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,542
- We won't let you down, Louis.
- I know you won't.

607
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,846
You think Jessica
really wears size 13s?

608
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:57,681
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

609
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,956
Oliver, how's it going?

610
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:07,124
It's going okay.

611
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,127
I'm finished
drafting six complaints.

612
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:12,630
What is it?

613
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:16,000
It's nothing, it's just,
in the time I did six,

614
00:23:16,035 --> 00:23:20,471
most of them did nine or ten.

615
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:23,741
I guess that means
you're in the home stretch, huh?

616
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,609
Guess I am.

617
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:30,981
Look, Oliver,
I know what you're thinking.

618
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:34,218
But I was telling Nathan
the truth.

619
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:35,798
I'm not looking to come back
here with these guys

620
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:38,823
instead of working with you.

621
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:41,125
I know you don't wanna
come back here, Mike.

622
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,928
I guess I just wanted to say
these associates are bad ass,

623
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,463
and I appreciate you choosing
to work with someone like me

624
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,799
over them.

625
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,078
You mind if I ask
how you're so sure

626
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:51,502
I don't want to come back here?

627
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:53,437
Because these associates
are amazing lawyers,

628
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:56,040
but not a single one of them
mentioned an actual human being

629
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:59,410
involved in this case
the whole night.

630
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,045
They're just trying to win.

631
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,713
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

632
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,515
but that's not you.

633
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,118
Yeah, Oliver, there is
something wrong with that.

634
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:09,665
And that's why you're
gonna be a better lawyer

635
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:13,357
than any one of these guys.

636
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:16,093
I'm gonna go tell Harvey
that we're in the home stretch.

637
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,867
[footsteps approaching]

638
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:27,171
- How's it going, genius?
- What?

639
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:29,406
I said, how's it going?

640
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,609
I'll tell you how it's going.

641
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,110
It's not going to work.
What?

642
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:34,723
But I thought that you said--
I don't care what you thought.

643
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:37,181
This isn't "Westworld."
I can't make her human.

644
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:39,027
Benjamin, I'm not asking you
to make her human.

645
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:40,963
I'm just asking you to give her
a little compassion.

646
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:42,786
Well I don't know how
to do that.

647
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,422
And it's supposed to learn
from itself, but it isn't.

648
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:51,362
Hey, what's going on?

649
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,645
The story I always told myself
was the only reason

650
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,104
I didn't work in Silicon Valley
was that I didn't want to,

651
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:04,375
but the truth is,
I don't have what it takes.

652
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,144
And then you come in here,
calling me a genius and--

653
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,381
Benjamin, it's okay.

654
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,950
You're only human.

655
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:16,353
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

656
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,689
Really?

657
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,591
Really.

658
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,192
Besides, if I can't show
you compassion,

659
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:26,764
how can I ever expect The Donna
to show compassion?

660
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,999
Thanks Donna.

661
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:31,702
I'm sorry
if I got your hopes up.

662
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,290
Figure out what we're going
to say tomorrow?

663
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:42,613
You get those complaints
ready?

664
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,648
- I asked you first.
- Yeah, but I'm not the one

665
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:46,595
who had the least experienced
lawyer I've ever met

666
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,118
put this thing
over the goal line.

667
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:50,098
Come on, I thought I was
the least experienced lawyer

668
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:51,322
you've ever met.
No, you were

669
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:53,157
the least experienced dickhead
I ever met.

670
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:55,626
- Right.
- Because that kid may be green,

671
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,361
but he's the only one of you two

672
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:59,330
that actually went
to law school.

673
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:03,000
[laughs] Don't I know it.

674
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,601
Mike, what's on your mind?

675
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,804
Nothing. It's just--
this whole thing we're doing

676
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,273
is making me lie to a lot
of people, including Oliver

677
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:12,543
and I'm not thrilled about it.

678
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,278
What are you talking about?

679
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:15,691
Nathan thinks
there's an ulterior motive

680
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,948
to this case and he's right.

681
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,919
Oliver saw it and I had to lie
to them both to cover it up.

682
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,555
Maybe that's true,
but you need to

683
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,423
keep your eye on the ball.

684
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,158
You deserve to be a lawyer.

685
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:29,693
You're doing good
for those miners

686
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,929
and that's all that matters.
I don't know, Harvey.

687
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:34,665
What do you care so much about
what this kid thinks anyway?

688
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,545
Because he's the reason
I decided to change my mind

689
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,369
about doing this whole thing.

690
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,371
- What do you mean?
- He's a great kid.

691
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,740
And he's gonna be
a great lawyer.

692
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:46,677
But I had to watch him
tank a case without being

693
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,980
able to help him and a woman
ended up out on the street.

694
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:53,317
I thought if we do this, then
I'll never to have to sit back

695
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:55,185
and do nothing
when someone I care about

696
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:57,054
is losing ever again.

697
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,456
Then stop worrying about
what we're doing

698
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,892
because tomorrow
isn't about losing.

699
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,494
It's about winning.

700
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,807
This is ridiculous.

701
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:14,387
We've been up all night
and we've got nothing.

702
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,311
- Yes, we do.
- What is this?

703
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:19,314
This is the key to keeping
Carly Donahue's business.

704
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:20,648
How is a three-year-old
interview

705
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:22,450
with "Gourmand Magazine"
going to help us?

706
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,119
Because it shows
she's a foodie.

707
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,421
And like Louis said,
we need to show her

708
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:30,258
that we don't only understand
her company, we understand her.

709
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:31,960
I get it.

710
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,495
What if we structured
the presentation

711
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,131
like a nine course meal
and paired a discrete piece

712
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,832
of legal analysis
with each course?

713
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:39,234
Like a paired wine tasting.

714
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,304
Coupled with
a paired wine tasting.

715
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,206
Hold on,
are you a foodie, too?

716
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:47,442
What I am is a lover
of fine wine,

717
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:49,244
delightful cuisine
and the ballet.

718
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,479
In any order you pick.
[chuckles] Well, I don't think

719
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:52,859
we can have dancers
at the meeting.

720
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:55,483
No, we can't. Which means
unless you know how to cook,

721
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,196
we need to find ourselves
a world class chef

722
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,554
and we need to find it fast.

723
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:02,323
What about this:
Mike and I just met with

724
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,527
a world class, French-trained
chef to cater our wedding.

725
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:07,862
I mean, if he's available then--
Book him.

726
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:09,275
Well don't you wanna hear
more about his--

727
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,943
Rachel, if I can't trust
your taste in pairings,

728
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,601
I can't trust anyone's.
What are you talking about?

729
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:15,937
I never thanked you for this,
but you knew

730
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:18,306
your father and I
would be a great fit.

731
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:23,244
And if you hadn't set me up with
him after I was fired,

732
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,913
I don't know what
I would have done.

733
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,717
I'll book the chef.

734
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:40,795
I assume from the fact
that you called,

735
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:42,397
you got our Christmas present.

736
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:44,799
I didn't call you,
I called Harvey Specter.

737
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,734
Well, he called me.
And I wanted to come

738
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,504
have a little chat with you
before you got it into your head

739
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:50,872
that you could go behind my back

740
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:54,242
and cut a deal without
an admission of guilt.

741
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:55,643
- What?
- Look, I don't give a shit

742
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,312
how much you offered,

743
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:58,658
you're not gonna
buy your way out of this thing

744
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,482
without telling the world
what you did.

745
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:02,984
I don't think you understand
what the word settlement means.

746
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,620
I understand
what it means to you,

747
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:09,090
I just don't give a shit.

748
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,037
- One hundred million.
- With an admission of guilt.

749
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:12,360
Sure, where do I sign?

750
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:13,828
Listen to me.

751
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,664
$100 million is the biggest
payout this company's ever made.

752
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,566
No, it's not
because I'm not taking it.

753
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:19,634
What is wrong with you?

754
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,113
I'm willing to cut
your clients a check

755
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:23,416
that'll change their lives
and you're too stupid to see it.

756
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,740
Here's what I see:
Every day this case drags on,

757
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:27,242
your stock is gonna take a hit.

758
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:29,010
And every quarter
when the board meets,

759
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,712
that's gonna be
their first question

760
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:33,815
and your biggest
God damn headache.

761
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,417
So the real question
is are you ready

762
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:40,021
to take responsibility
for what you did or not?

763
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,329
I see you wore your power suit
for your return to the majors.

764
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:49,697
You gonna play in Yankee
Stadium,

765
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,199
you gotta wear the pinstripes.

766
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,700
How'd it go?

767
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,869
Good. He did exactly
what we thought he would.

768
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,704
Tried to lowball me,
called me an idiot

769
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,039
and then kicked me out.

770
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,040
How high did he go?

771
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:01,075
- A hundred million.
- [scoffs]

772
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,510
- What?
- Nothing, it's just

773
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:03,756
I would've gotten him up to two.

774
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,891
And how exactly would
you have done that

775
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,247
when you told me
not to counter?

776
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:09,617
I'm more intimidating.
I walk into a room, people cave.

777
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:10,618
It's a gift.
I think it's a gift

778
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:12,554
when you leave the room.
My gift to you

779
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:14,856
was saving your ass
when you screwed the pooch

780
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:19,127
by involving me in this case.

781
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,896
Seriously, Harvey,
I appreciate you

782
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:23,698
rolling with this thing.

783
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,667
Especially when
I had to improvise.

784
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:27,502
Don't worry about it.
The truth is,

785
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:29,837
I like getting the chance
to work with you again.

786
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:32,507
Besides, don't tell Rachel,
I like the added risk.

787
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:34,676
- Oh, I know.
- How do you know?

788
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:36,010
'Cause you told me.

789
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,279
"Life's like this,
but I like this."

790
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:39,847
What am I, Luke Perry?

791
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:41,583
- Sometimes.
- Look, I gotta go.

792
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:44,285
'Cause this asshole's gonna be
back in my office in an hour,

793
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,121
trying to cut a deal with me
behind your back.

794
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:58,199
Oh, my God.

795
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:00,068
This is amazing.
You really think so?

796
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:01,936
I know so.
It's the perfect legal analysis

797
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:03,382
combined with
the perfect presentation.

798
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,151
So, you don't think the fact
that Jessica isn't here--

799
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:07,175
Jessica Schmessica.
Carly's gonna be blown away.

800
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,810
I should promote
you both right now.

801
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:09,944
- Will you?
- No.

802
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,424
- Worth a try.
- Okay, we have some time.

803
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:13,381
So I'll meet you both
back here in an hour.

804
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,850
- Where are you going?
- Gonna go have a prunie.

805
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:18,252
Wanna clean out the pipes
for the nine course meal.

806
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,292
Mike Ross.

807
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,728
- Yes?
- I'm Craig Seidel.

808
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,229
What?
What are you doing here?

809
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,442
I wanna know
what the hell you're doing.

810
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,509
What you mean,
what am I doing?

811
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:32,634
I mean, you filed 150 suits,
not just one.

812
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:34,280
And James Palmer's
gonna fight each one of them.

813
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:36,048
Which means this thing
is gonna drag on forever.

814
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:37,550
And we're gonna
drop the hammer on him

815
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:38,684
as soon as he gets to Harvey's.

816
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,008
Now I don't wanna see you again

817
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:43,177
until I meet you for the first
time at that hearing.

818
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,179
Don't you walk away from me.

819
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:47,193
I hired Harvey to do a job,
he farmed it out to you

820
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:49,061
against my will and you're gonna
God damn listen to me.

821
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:50,618
No, you didn't hire Harvey.

822
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,987
You tried to mess with my
fiancée's life and you're lucky

823
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,555
we didn't
have you disbarred.

824
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,835
So instead of coming
to my place of work

825
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,203
and harassing me,
why don't you go back

826
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:58,993
to your hole
and we'll tell you it's done.

827
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,995
Okay,
but your window's closing.

828
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,274
This doesn't
get wrapped up soon,

829
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:05,033
your shot at being
a lawyer is over.

830
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,472
If you're gonna
bankroll a suit,

831
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:13,675
at least have the balls
to negotiate it yourself.

832
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,110
I take it
you didn't like the offer.

833
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:16,644
Admission of guilt
isn't an offer.

834
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,979
It's suicide.

835
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:19,847
It's Mike Ross' case,
it's his call.

836
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:22,483
Bullshit.
Mike Ross is some clinic worker.

837
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,086
You're Harvey Specter.
And from what I hear about you,

838
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,788
you don't give a shit
about guilt.

839
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:28,423
You're right, I don't.

840
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:32,460
So why don't you tell me
how much it's gonna take

841
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:35,129
to make this go away.
500 million.

842
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:36,898
Half a billion dollars?
Are you insane?

843
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,833
You poisoned your employees,
Mr. Palmer.

844
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,146
You're lucky
you're not in prison.

845
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,569
- 200 million.
- No.

846
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:44,672
- 300
- No.

847
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:48,042
Okay, make it 350
and call it a day.

848
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:49,777
500.
Not a penny less.

849
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:51,679
In that case,
make it zero

850
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:54,916
because you just confirmed what
I suspected since this morning.

851
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,585
You picked the exact number to
make my stock take a nosedive

852
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,054
and we both know
who benefits from that.

853
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,222
Craig Seidel.

854
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:02,668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

855
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:04,336
Then I guess you also don't
know that Mike Ross

856
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,938
just got an appointment
with the ethics board

857
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,930
and it's a crime
to trade this for that.

858
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:12,100
Which means
your lawsuit is over.

859
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:14,602
Then I'll do something else.

860
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,837
You think I won't go after you

861
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,306
for stealing technology
from Seidel's company?

862
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:20,074
You have no proof
I did anything.

863
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,275
No, but he does

864
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:22,922
and I don't give
a shit about his marriage,

865
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:24,323
and I'm going to make him
come forward.

866
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:25,347
His marriage?

867
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,215
Is that what
he told you this is about?

868
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,183
Well, I've got news for you,
Mr. Specter,

869
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:30,518
the reason
he hasn't come forward

870
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:32,653
has nothing
to do with his marriage.

871
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:35,456
So, why don't you go find out
what's what.

872
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,525
And I got a feeling when you do,

873
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,360
you'll drop this
case by the morning.

You ran out
of the presentation so quickly,

879
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:00,942
I didn't get to ask
what you thought.

880
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:04,034
I had to get to class,
but I thought it went great.

What about Louis?
He was over the Moon.

I'm sure he's glad

I'm glad to be back.

00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,648
working with my dad?

886
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,150
You said it was a great pairing
and I was just wondering--

887
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,553
- What you were missing.
- Yes.

888
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,122
You were missing a brilliant,

889
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:28,558
tireless, sweet, funny,
charming man.

890
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:31,695
who may also be the best
litigator I've ever seen.

891
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,797
Maybe you didn't understand
my question.

892
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:36,733
I was asking what it was like
to work with Zane,

893
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:40,270
not Kaldor.
Rachel, I'm serious.

894
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,050
I learned a lot about
your father while I was there

895
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:44,841
and I'm telling you,
it was all good.

896
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,843
What about his temper?

897
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,447
Well, maybe it wasn't
all good.

898
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:53,784
Well, good night.

899
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:58,188
One more thing
I learned about him.

900
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:00,857
He doesn't just love you,
he respects you.

901
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,171
- How would you know that--
- When he offered you that job,

902
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:04,761
he was beaming.

903
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:07,798
He told everyone in the office
that his brilliant baby girl

904
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,399
was gonna work for us
and she was gonna

905
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:11,535
blow us all to smithereens.

906
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,007
- He said that?
- Rachel, I didn't tell you that

907
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,009
to make you feel bad.

908
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:22,145
He was okay
that you didn't take his offer.

909
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:25,749
It doesn't make me feel bad.

910
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:27,517
It makes me feel great.

911
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:38,762
- Is he in?
- No, he had to run out.

912
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:40,297
All right, do me a favor,

913
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:44,167
just tell him I need to
talk to him when he gets back.

914
00:35:44,203 --> 00:35:47,504
You mind if I ask
what it's about?

915
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:50,540
I just got off the phone
with Carly Donahue.

916
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,253
Louis, what happened?
Rachel said that it went great.

917
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,722
I thought it did, too,
but then she called me

918
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:55,323
and said that the next time she
asks for a meeting

919
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:56,958
with me and Harvey,
she better get a goddamn meeting

920
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,349
with me and Harvey
instead of two nobodies.

921
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,385
- What did you tell her?
- I told her how dare she

922
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,819
talk about my superstars
like that.

923
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:04,087
She's lucky to have them.

924
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:05,400
Louis, that's great.
Good for you.

925
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:08,492
She fired us, Donna.

926
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,028
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry.
Look, this isn't your fault.

927
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:13,363
- You couldn't have known.
- It's okay.

928
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,831
I just need to go home.

929
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,771
[sighs]
Shit.

930
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,205
<i>The Donna:</i>
<i>It's okay, Donna.</i>

931
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,541
<i>It's not your fault, either.</i>
Yes, it is.

932
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,109
I'm Donna,
I should have known.

933
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:27,577
<i>The Donna:</i>
<i>Maybe, but you always say</i>

934
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:29,980
<i>part of being human</i>
<i>is messing up sometimes</i>

935
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:32,649
<i>and you may be Donna,</i>
<i>but you're still human.</i>

936
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,722
Holy shit.

937
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:40,924
You are ready.

938
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,600
Oliver.

939
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:53,336
Hey, what are you doing here?

940
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:55,105
I want to know
if I was wrong about you.

941
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,484
- What are you talking about?
- I wanna know

942
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,009
if you're using this case
to get back to Pearson Specter.

943
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,311
Oliver,
we talked about this.

944
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,146
I thought you understood
that's not who I am.

945
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,959
I thought so, too,
but then I got to thinking.

946
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:06,683
You fooled so many people
for so long.

947
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:08,251
What if you're fooling me now?

948
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:10,353
Because you said Pearson Specter
would never take on

949
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,000
a case like this when
you were there before.

950
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,668
Yeah, because they never
wanted to be on the wrong side

951
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:14,791
of a corporate lawsuit.

952
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:16,337
Then why are they on
the wrong side of one now?

953
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,629
- Oliver--
- Please, don't lie to me, Mike.

954
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:21,531
Just tell me what's going on.

955
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:30,240
It's a long story,
but we brought the suit

956
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,142
so I that could
get into the Bar.

957
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:34,522
So you were lying to Nathan,
only not about what he thought.

958
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,924
- Listen to me--
- I'm not gonna listen

959
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:37,525
and you need to tell him
what's going on.

960
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,516
I can't do that
and I wasn't lying to him

961
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,718
when I said I'm not going back
to my old firm.

962
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:42,897
I wasn't lying to him
when I said

963
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:44,287
these people's lives
matter to me

964
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,356
and I wasn't lying to
either one of you when I said

965
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,658
I care about what kind of lawyer
you're gonna be.

966
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:50,438
Well, if you care what kind of
lawyer I'm going to be,

967
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:53,363
set the right example

968
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,066
because you owe it to Nathan
to tell him the truth.

969
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,977
- Hi.
- Hey.

970
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,217
What's this?

971
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,786
It's every yearbook
I've ever had.

972
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:18,533
It was so nice doing it
with yours the other night

973
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:21,925
I thought maybe tonight we could
do it with mine.

974
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,661
Louis, what's wrong?

975
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:32,402
Nothing's wrong.
I, uh--had a bad day

976
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:33,515
and I wanted to talk
to you about it.

977
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:34,504
But you went to
all this trouble

978
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,850
and I don't want
to bring you down.

979
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:40,243
Louis, my yearbooks are always
gonna be here.

980
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,246
And hearing about something as
important to you as your work

981
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:45,115
isn't going to bring me down.

982
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,250
It's going to bring us closer.

983
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:51,821
Are you sure because I have
a lot of bad days at work.

984
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:53,356
Which is all the more reason

985
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:56,626
for you to have someone
to make you feel better at home.

986
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:02,299
Okay, but it's kind of
a long story.

987
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:04,634
Well then you sit right here,
I'll go make you a drink

988
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,736
and then you can tell me
all about it.

989
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:08,672
You know what
I'm in the mood for?

990
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:11,074
I can't tell which one yet,
but I'm pretty sure its either

991
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,211
a Peach Schnapps or a nice,
cold Prunie.

992
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:15,890
You really are getting
to know me, aren't you?

993
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:17,914
I sure am.

994
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,223
[knocking]

995
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:31,294
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing here?

996
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,774
You guys told me to stay
away from you.

997
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:34,264
Yeah, that was before
I had a chat

998
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:35,665
with your buddy James Palmer.

999
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,078
Look, I don't even know
James Palmer,

1000
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:38,246
so whatever he said--
He didn't have to

1001
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,036
say anything,
all he had to do was point.

1002
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:45,353
So what? This is an off-shore
account in my name.

1003
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:47,844
An off-shore account
with $300,000 in it,

1004
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:51,348
deposited exactly a day
after Velocity supposedly

1005
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:52,749
stole your technology.

1006
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:54,762
I was told by my accountant
to shelter certain earnings.

1007
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,953
Bullshit. You don't have
those kind of earnings.

1008
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,400
And you didn't have to keep this
quiet because you're married.

1009
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:01,858
You kept it quiet because
you're in on it.

1010
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:03,493
I was in on it.

1011
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:06,329
I saw a chance to jump ship
and get paid in the process.

1012
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:07,897
But instead,
they pulled the job

1013
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,111
and put just enough money
in that account to implicate me.

1014
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:12,769
- You piece of shit.
- Please, my employees

1015
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:14,315
are gonna lose their jobs
because of me.

1016
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,240
We need to keep this suit going
and get that technology back.

1017
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,908
Nuh-uh, buddy.

1018
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,644
You don't give a shit
about your employees

1019
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,245
and I don't give a shit
about you.

1020
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:23,658
This deal is done.
You can't do this.

1021
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,415
Yes, I can
and I didn't have

1022
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,417
leverage before,
but I have it now.

1023
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:29,352
So you're not just
getting Mike an interview,

1024
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,821
you're gonna block anyone
who tries to vote no.

1025
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:33,623
And if you don't,
your boss is gonna get

1026
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:36,760
an anonymous tip
that you sold trade secrets.

1027
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,573
And I'm gonna make sure to
send this along with it.

1028
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:39,974
You're my attorney.
You work for me.

1029
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:41,798
You can't do that.
I don't work for you.

1030
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,834
Remember, Craig?
That's how I set it up.

1031
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,269
See you at the Bar.
