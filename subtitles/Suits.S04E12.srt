In front of gerard,
but has it occurred to you

Last year, you were
shitting yourself

He'd find out about you,

174
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,094
And now you think
we should work with him?

175
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,862
No, I wasn't worried
he'd find out.

00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,464
I was worried about louis.

177
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,432
Gerard didn't bat
an eye at me back then,

178
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,867
And he didn't just now.

179
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,001
But we get him out of this

180
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,603
And he ever does
find out about me,

181

He's gonna owe us.

182

Mike, that man is never
gonna compromise his ethics

183
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,975
Just because we got him
out of a jam.

184

Never gonna compromise
his ethics?

You just said he took a bribe.

So what does that
have to do with anything?

to do with everything

that money fairly,

No.

to cover her ass,

320
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,321
So I get one
of your clients in return.

321
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,657
You want one of my clients,
we can talk about that,

322
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,125
But gerard's staying with me.

323
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,660
Oh, please, don't pretend

324
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,028
Like you actually care
about him.

325
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,295
He can't even stand you.

326
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,398
Louis, I just offered
to consider giving you

327
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,432
One of my clients,

328
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,334
So I suggest you let gerard go.

329
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,935
No, I'm not letting anything go,

330
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,370
Because it doesn't make
any sense.

331
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,039
Not only can't he stand you.

332
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
He doesn't respect you
because he's got things...

333
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,342
What did you just say to me?

334
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,344
I said he doesn't respect you.

335
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,346
Well, you know what?

336
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,380
He definitely
doesn't respect you,

337
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,050
Because when he told me
he needed a lawyer,

338
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,951
I tried to send him your way,

339
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,386
And his exact words were,

340
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,122
"I don't want louis.
I want you."

341
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,126
Fine.

342
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,461
Then I'll just take
another one of your clients.

343
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,963
- You're not taking a thing.
- You just said that I could...

344
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,965
Look, I don't give a shit
what I just said, okay?

345
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,300
My clients are my clients.

346
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,368
And you don't get
out of my office

347
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,936
In the next three seconds,

348
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,337
Something's gonna happen
between you and me,

349
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,473
And I guarantee
it won't end with you

350
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,176
Keeping all of your teeth.

351
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,049
No.

352
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,718
Just turn around and walk
right back out that door.

353
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,086
- Harvey.
- Did you hear what I said?

354
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,320
I did, but apparently,
you didn't hear

355
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,322
What jessica said
about wiping the slate clean.

356
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,091
And apparently, you didn't
hear what I said,

357
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,193
Because I just told louis
he could have one of my clients.

358
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,994
And three seconds later,
you told him he couldn't.

359
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,262
Yeah, because I realized
that I'm paying

360
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,430
For jessica's mistake.

361
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,466
No, harvey, you were willing
to pay for her mistake

362
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,035
Right up until louis said
gerard doesn't respect you.

363
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,236
Oh, that has nothing
to do with it.

364
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,038
You can lie to yourself
all you want,

365
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,206
But I'm not gonna
let you bullshit me.

366
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,373
What the hell
are you talking about?

367
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,342
Henry gerard is the one
person you respect

368
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,478
Who never respected you,
and louis touched that nerve.

369
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,147
And I told you that
has nothing to do with it.

370
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,215
You really think that?

371
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,297
I don't think it.
I know it.

372
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,350
Then you know what, harvey?

373
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,592
You're no different than louis,

374
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,754
Because you have a chance
to help us all move on,

375
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,388
And you are blowing it off
out of pettiness,

376
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,224
Which is exactly
what louis would do.

377
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,225
What do you want from me, donna?

378
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,459
I want you
to be a grown-up

379
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,295
And do what you said you'd do
in the first place.

380
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,037
(harvey) you got something?

381
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,405
(mike) yeah, we've been
overlooking the obvious.

382
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,974
Yeah, I'm not in the mood
for 20 questions.

383
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,041
Give it to me.

384
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,343
Unless you're traveling
internationally

385
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,245
And don't report it,
carrying cash on board a plane

386
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,312
Isn't a crime.

387
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,480
Great, except for the fact

388
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,249
That gerard's not being
charged with smuggling.

389
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,316
He's being sued.

390
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,317
Right, but my point is,

391
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,052
How did garrett brady
even find that out?

392
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,088
Well, he found out
because gerard

393
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,256
Was detained by the tsa.

394
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,057
Who talked to him
for five minutes

395
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,259
And then sent him on his way.

396
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,526
Those searches aren't a matter

397
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,961
Of public record.

398
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,263
- Exactly.
- Holy shit.

399
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,364
Brady bribed the tsa.

400
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,431
Which isn't only illegal.

401
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,500
It makes that report
totally inadmissible.

402
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,169
You figured this out
on your own?

403
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,070
Well, I would've done it faster,
but I had to order some sushi.

404
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,206
[chuckles]
"would've done it faster."

405
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,374
That's what you said
your first week here,

406
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,209
Except it was pizza
instead of sushi.

407
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,310
Yeah, I'm growing.

408
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,512
You mean rachel
taught you how to eat.

409
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,447
Like I said, I'm growing.

410
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,086
Hey, donna, I'm a little
busy at the moment.

411
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,988
Too busy to take on this?

412
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,056
What's that?

413
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,424
Just the first client
that jessica gave harvey

414
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,092
When he made name partner.

415
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,527
Harvey said he wouldn't
let me have any of his clients.

416
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,162
No.
He said he would.

417
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,530
But then instead
of taking him up on it,

418
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,165
You went ahead
and shit on his feelings.

419
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,433
Please.
Harvey doesn't have feelings.

420
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,168
That's not true,
and you know it.

421
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,436
And you of all people
should know that a person

422
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,104
Can overreact when they're hurt.

423
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,239
If you're referring to me,

424
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,373
I do not overreact when...

425
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,175
Okay, whatever you say,
fatty-baldy.

426
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,345
Okay, get the hell
out of my office and...

427
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,114
Fine, you have a small,
legitimate point.

428
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,196
I really hurt his feelings?

429
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,383
Yeah, you really did.

430
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,152
But then he realized
he was overreacting

431
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,386
And that this was
a chance for us all

432
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,222
To get back to where we were.

433
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,957
You swear that is
the first client

434
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,025
That jessica gave him
after me made name partner?

435
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,994
I swear.

436
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,996
Leave me the file.

437
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,245
You two go ahead.
I haven't decided yet.

438
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,512
Actually, we're not here
for the falafel.

439
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,314
We're here to introduce
ourselves.

440
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,382
Mike ross.

441
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
Harvey specter.

442
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,985
We represent henry gerard.

443
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,219
Ah.
[laughs]

444
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,154
Well, in that case,
let me buy you two lunch,

445
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,323
Because I'm about to come
into an unexpected windfall.

446
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,524
Well, I guess
that's your thing...

447
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,126
Paying people off.

448
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,295
I hope the tsa got more
than some shitty falafel.

449
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,529
What the hell
are you talking about?

450
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,265
I'm talking about this.

451
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,303
Oh. Bribery?

452
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,504
(harvey) ironic, isn't it?

453
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,374
You suing professor gerard
for accepting a bribe

454
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,442
When you're the one
paying off federal employees.

455
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,111
Allegedly paying, counselor.

456
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,145
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

457
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,380
You don't want to slander me.

458
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,348
- So you admit it.
- I don't admit a thing.

459
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,183
Your client sold out victims
of a train derailment.

460
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,351
He's going to pay.

461
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,287
You may not be willing
to admit anything here,

462
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,055
But you'll have to
in front of the judge.

463
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,089
Because I've drafted subpoenas

464
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,525
For every tsa employee
on duty that night.

465
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,594
Drop the case,
mr. Brady.

466
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,062
Are you threatening me?

467
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,064
No, we're informing you.

468
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,399
Well, let me inform you.

469
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,067
In case you forgot,
the tsa falls

470
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,535
Under the department
of homeland security,

471
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,283
Which makes this
a national security issue.

472
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,338
This has nothing to do

473
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,273
With national security,
and you know it.

474
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,975
All I know is
the government found

475
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,143
A large sum of cash
on a passenger.

476
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,210

639
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,610
You didn't used to
treat me that way.

640
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,515
I didn't used to know you
lied to me on a daily basis.

641
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,918
Louis, it would serve you right

642
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,322
If I take my bag
and leave you here

643
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,324
And go home to the man
that I love.

644
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,425
So you're not gonna help.

645
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,959
No, I'm gonna help you,

646
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,961
But not because you deserve it.

647
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,364
I'll do it because I am
an associate,

648
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,867
And I am a professional,
which means I am capable

649
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,870
Of putting the personal aside
in order to do my job.

650
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,876
(mike) and one of those, please.

651
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,645
Just what I was in the mood for.

652
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,913
Ah, you're getting a bagel.

653
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,047
That means you kicked ass.

654
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,016
Which I did.

655
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,351
You called up the tsa,

656
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,058
Busted up their
national security defense?

657
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,854
No, I used their defense.

658
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,356
Gerard's gonna testify
under seal

659
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,391
Because it's a matter
of national security.

660
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,559
And the judge bought that?

661
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,593
What's not to buy?

662
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,061
The tsa made
the argument for us.

663
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,129
And what did brady say?

664
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,398
That's the best part about it.

665
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,100
He doesn't even know it.

666
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,402
It's a matter
of national security.

667
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,603
We testify under seal,

668
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,473
The judge realizes that gerard
is a degenerate gambler...

669
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,475
But a fair mediator.

670
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,376
The case gets dismissed,
and garrett brady

671
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,478
And harvard law
never know it happened.

672
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,012
You thought of all
of that on your own?

673
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,614
You think you're the only
one who can come up

674
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,449
With an intelligent solution?

675
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,584
You are 1 for 400

676
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,119
In the time
we've worked together.

677
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,488
Okay, smart guy, since
I did your job for you,

678
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,089
You're gonna do my job for me.

679
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,457
You want me to prep gerard

680
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,993
And listen to him talk
for two hours.

681
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,595
I didn't want to 15 years ago,

682
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,963
And I don't want to now.

683
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,098
We only get one shot at this,

684
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,401
And his testimony
better be rock solid.

685
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,468
Thanks.

686
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,605
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself!

687
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,973
Dick.

688
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,481
I see you haven't slept.

689
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,016
I have a lot of work
that needs attending to.

690
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,085
I bet you do, considering
the phone call

691
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,553
I got from joan walsh
this morning.

692
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,422
[groans] she called you?

693
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,329
She wanted to know what
the other name partners

694
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,626
Were going to do about the one
that screwed the pooch.

695
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:49,994
Oh, come on, that is not fair.

696
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,095
I didn't have all
the information...

697
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,630
You had enough information

698
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,432
To make a deal
to get her from harvey,

699
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,133
And part of that deal was
you backing me with jeff.

700
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,468
Oh, so that's why you're here.

701
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,636
You don't trust
I'm still gonna do it?

702
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,137
Because you haven't done it yet,

703
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,106
And you have a history
of making poor decisions

704
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,607
When things aren't
going your way.

705
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,142
The only poor decision
I've made is agreeing

706
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,544
To cover for you
in the first place.

707
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,878
You didn't think that
was such a bad idea

708
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,180
When you were using it
to get what you wanted.

709
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,015
And now you're threatening
to take that thing away.

710
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,683
Louis, you want to keep joan,

711
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,884
That's on you,

712
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,153
But I held up my end
of the bargain.

713
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,888
You better hold up yours.

714
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,963
(mike) I just want to go over
it one more time, professor.

715
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,498
How much money was in that pot?

716
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm tried of going over it.

717
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,869
Why do we have to keep replaying

718
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,170
Every moment of this game?

719
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,139
Because your entire case
depends on it.

720
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,476
My case depends on the fact
that I won that money gambling,

721
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,211
Not whether I won it
with a flush.

722
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,246
Your case depends on
the judge believing you,

723
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,482
And if he finds any holes
in your testimony, then we...

724
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,984
I gave you the names of
everyone I knew at that game.

725
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,226
But none of those men were
there when you won that money.

726
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,022
I can't help it if I didn't
get the name of the guy I beat.

727
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,025
Which is why your story
needs to be rock solid.

728
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,498
Okay.

729
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,032
Go ahead.

730
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,901
So I ask you again, professor,

731
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,569
How much money
was in the final pot?

732
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,505
Roughly $12,000.

733
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,639
And you won that hand.

734
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,174
As I said before, I won,

735
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,208
And then I cashed out.

736
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,243
And what did you have again?

737
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:13,245
A queen-high flush.

738
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,879
And who did you beat?

739
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,280
I told you,
I didn't get his name.

740
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,681
Okay, so what did he have?

741
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,618
Two pair, queens over sixes.

742
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,089
Wait a second.

743
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,558
You said before that
the man next to you

744
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,893
Folded with two queens up,

745
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,027
And now this guy has two queens,

746
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,128
And you had
a queen-high flush?

747
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,631
I said that the man next to me

748
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:34,665
Folded with two kings.

749
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,733
No, you didn't.

750
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,901
You heard me wrong.

751
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,636
No, I didn't.

752
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,170
Is this part of prepping me,

753
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,672
Or are you accusing me
of something?

754
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,073
I'm trying to get
your story to line up.

755
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,309
- My story does line up.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

756
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,144
Look, young man, if you're
gonna sit over there

757
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,178
And call me a liar...

758
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,313
I'm not calling you a liar,

759
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,181
But if you say tomorrow
what you said today,

760
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,316
We're gonna be
in a lot of trouble,

761
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,551
Because where I come from,

762
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,119
There are only
four queens in a deck.

763
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,087
I said two kings,

764
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,657
And I'm gonna say that
again tomorrow.

765
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,626
So you do your job,

766
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,228
And I'm gonna do mine.

767
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,102
(mike) he's lying.

768
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,250
What are you talking about?

769
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,672
Gerard's story about
winning all that money

770
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,973
Playing poker is bullshit.

771
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,908
All right, slow down.
What the hell happened?

772
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,643
I did the math,
and the hands don't add up.

773
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,045
What do you mean
you did the math?

774
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,013
I mean first he said that he
drew a queen on fourth street,

775
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,248
And then when I pressed
him about it, he...

776
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,349
Wait a second.

777
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,184
This conclusion is based
on him recalling hands

778
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,652
Under cross-examination?

779
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:29,687
Harvey, I got kicked out

780
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,154
Of atlantic city
for counting cards.

781
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,656
- I know this shit.
- It doesn't mean he's lying.

782
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,191
I got a little experience
with that too,

783
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,693
And I'm telling you, he was.

784
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,028
- Or maybe he's tired.
- Or maybe I'm right.

785
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,030
Or maybe you don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

786
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,666
- Why are you defending him?
- Because you asked me to.

787
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,640
Look, harvey,

788
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,275
I'm not saying that
he took a bribe.

789
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:55,179
I'm just saying that he didn't
get that money playing poker.

790
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,349
Well, unless he admitted that,
he's testifying tomorrow.

791
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,687
Since when do you stick
your head in the sand?

792
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,923
- Did he admit it?
- No, he didn't.

793
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,025
But he screwed up the details,
and he shouldn't have,

794
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,995
Because people who are telling
the truth get it right.

795
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,197
And you know it.

796
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,147
What's that?

797
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,415
Jacks full of fours.

798
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,283
I can see that, but why...

799
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,119
Why is it staring you
in the face?

800
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,921
It's what I threw down
the last time I won a huge hand.

801
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:42,126
It was six weeks ago,
and I can remember every hand

802
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,994
That every player
at that table had.

803
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,329
Now, if you won money
the other night,

804
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,430
You'd remember it too.

805
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,931
I do remember,

806
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,333
And as I explained
to your associate...

807
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,069
Yeah, stop bullshitting me.

808
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,338
Where the hell did that
money really come from?

809
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,673
'Cause if you don't
tell me the truth,

810
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,141
I'm canceling
that hearing right now.

811
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,146
It came...

812
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,048
From a student of mine.

813
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,249
For what?

814
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,951
In exchange
for changing his grade.

815
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,320
Jesus christ.
For $25,000?

816
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,189
He was going to fail my class,

817
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,058
And that would've stopped him
from getting an offer from...

818
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,693
You goddamn hypocrite.

819
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,195
You preach about ethics,
and you do this?

820
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,230
This is about ethics.

821
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,199
And you don't have
any idea why I did it.

822
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,201
I don't care why you did it.

823
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,036
I care about what
you're making me do,

824
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,471
Because I am not
suborning perjury.

825
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,474
Well, you tell me that you've
never done anything worse.

826
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,478
I knew it.

827
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,247
You would do it
for someone else...

828
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,482
But not for me.

829
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,918
You know what, professor?

830
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,020
There's a small part of me
that actually thought

831
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,289
That you came to me because
you thought I'm the best,

832
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,458
But you just think I'll do
whatever it takes to win.

833
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,027
Isn't that what
makes you the best?

834
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,030
Get someone else
to do your dirty work,

835
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,032
Because I'm not
suborning perjury.

I've been sitting here
all night,

842

And restless leg syndrome
kills 14 people every hour.

I don't think that's accurate.

Okay, you're arguing
anything in r & d

848
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,468
Is the intellectual property

849
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,036
Of the person
who suggested the product?

850
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,172
Until such time that
the results become public.

851
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,040
Which they did the second
I sent the board that letter.

852
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,075
Except board members are subject

853
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,176
To the nondisclosure agreement.

854
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,344
Well, the board members
haven't signed

855
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,345
A nondisclosure agreement.

Yet.

00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,082
What's to stop them
from refusing?

858
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,150
Nothing, but if they do,

859
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,311
Then the noncompete kicks in.

860
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,253
Preventing them from revealing
the contents of my letter

861
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,487
Under threat of prosecution.

862
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,356
Specifically
corporate espionage.

863
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,358
Oh, my god.
You got this idea from...

864
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,993
- Our bylaws.
- My bylaws.

Acceptable.

I think the word you're
looking for is "awesome."

Well, the word I'm saying
is, "get out",

Because I have a meeting
to prepare for."

870
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,340
You know what, louis?
I have been working all night.

871
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,543
And this gets your ass
out of a major sling,

872
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,344
So instead of dismissing me,

873
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,013
You should be asking me
to come with you.

874

Excuse me, miss professional.

875
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,049
You wanted me to treat you
like every other associate.

- Now I am.
- By acting as if I did nothing?

No, by acknowledging
you did acceptable work.

878
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,188
Letting you come with me
is something

879
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,223
That I would only do for you
if we were friends,

880

You were right.

884
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,343
He was lying.

I'm sorry.

886
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,180
You know, I knew
he was a hypocrite

887
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,548
After I found out
about the gambling.

888
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,484
I never thought
he'd sell out harvard.

889
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,222
What are you talking about?

890
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,423
He did take the bribe,

891
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,491
But it had nothing to do
with the accident victims.

892
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,027
He did it to change
someone's grade.

893
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,064
Why would he do that?

894
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,232
What difference does it make?

895
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,367
Either way, he was gonna
let me suborn perjury.

896
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,502
It makes a difference because
we still have to win this case.

897
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,504
Oh, I don't give a shit
about winning this case.

I've never heard you say

00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:22,512
You... you care
about winning every case,

Every game, every argument.

Did you hear me?

903
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,350
He was gonna let me
suborn perjury.

904
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,151
And so would
every client you have

905
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,353
If they thought
they'd get away with it.

906
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,520
He's not every client.

907
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,256
No, he's the one you hated
in the first place.

908
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,157
- I didn't hate him.
- Harvey, what is going on here?

909
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,095
I thought he was better than us.

910
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,163
I sat in that class
and listened to him talk

911
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,267
About what kind
of lawyers we should be,

912
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,003
And I always let him down
because I knew

913
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,505
That wasn't the kind
of lawyer that wins.

914
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,307
And I wanted to win.

915
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,309
So I'd argue with him,

916
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,478
And he'd look down on me.

917
00:31:56,347 --> 00:32:00,417
And now instead of you
letting him down,

918
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,985
He let you down.

919
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,022
He turned out to be
no better than any of us.

920
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,265
So then let's make him
better than us.

00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,984
It's a chance
to make things right.

00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,285
Ha.

928
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,323
You cannot call
board members employees

929
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,558
Based on them having access
to an expense account.

930
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,427
Not just an expense account.

931
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,996
They have corporate cards
and standing offices,

932
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,031
Which, as defined
by section 14.2

00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,499
Of the internal revenue code,

934

Makes them employees.

Well, mr. Litt,

936
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:56,106
Seems I won't be demanding
a new point person after all.

937
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,275
I'm glad to hear that.

Of course I am.

You're my first client
as name partner.

You're very important to me.

942
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,550
Well, I suppose
we'll find out the truth

943
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,285
When someone else
makes name partner.

944
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,987
What are you talking about?

945
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,355
I'm not an idiot.

946
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,390
I know that no one in your firm
wants to deal with me.

947
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,458
That's not true.

948
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,525
In fact, I fought for you.

949
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,361
You may have thought
you were fighting for me,

950
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,429
But I know that jessica
dumped me on harvey,

951
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,265
And it seems that the second
you made name partner,

952
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,001
Harvey did the same thing
to you.

953
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,106
Oh, you didn't know that,
did you?

954
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,375
Then maybe we were
meant for each other,

955
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,777
Since we're both
left out of the club.

You make this big speech
about repairing our friendship,

leaving out the fact

Well, just tell me right now,
can he stand her?

No, but he was gonna keep her

966

You should.

She is important, louis,
but you can't see that

979
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,789
Because you didn't
want a client.

980
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,457
You just wanted to take
something away from harvey.

981

What I want is respect.

982
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,793

And get on the goddamn team.

You mean the team that kept
mike's secret from me?

No, louis!

986

I mean the team that
protected its own,

987
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:34,404
Because that's what teams do.

And, you know, I shouldn't
even be telling you this

Because she wasn't going to,

But if you need
a little bit more evidence

991

Of what we do for each other,

- That's right.

And you've been treating
rachel like shit.

So, if you're done

Thanks for meeting me.
