1
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,753
What is that, three in a row?

2
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,722
That would be four, actually.

3
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,090
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

4
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:18,491
What do you say,
we go five outta nine?

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,593
So you can keep abusing me?
No, thank you.

6
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:21,823
I'm done. Oh, come on.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,186
I'll spot you three.

8
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:24,503
Game time's over, Wyatt.
They're here.

9
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,743
They're here?

10
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,206
You can set up
in the conference room.

11
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,575
Yeah. No, I'm just...

12
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:32,640
Get set up in
the conference room.

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,940
You did let him win, right?
It wasn't easy.

14
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,874
The guy has the coordination
of a two-year-old.

15
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,374
I know, the last time these
venture capitalists came in,

16
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,909
I took him boxing to
calm him down.

17
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,109
I basically had to punch myself
in the face to let him win.

18
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,778
I don't get it.
I mean, if he's such a genius,

19
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,716
why does he get so nervous
around a bunch of investors?

20
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,754
Eh, you spend
two years working on

21
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,222
a satellite phone
that fits in your pocket

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,490
and then bet the company on it.

23
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,295
You'd be a little
nervous too, I think.

24
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,164
The prototype...

25
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:59,100
I can't find it.
I don't know where I...

26
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:01,071
You mean this?

27
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:02,475
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

28
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,977
- Fail miserably.
- I would.

29
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,683
- Is that the...
- $20 million prototype, yes.

30
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,319
And you don't even
get to look at this bad boy

31
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,088
until after
we close the deal today.

32
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,325
Wow, they're
like storm troopers.

33
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,827
Storm troopers
don't write checks.

34
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,697
Now all you gotta do
is walk in there,

35
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,165
show them
how the phone works...

36
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,371
Right, and Suntech Digital
will be a new force

37
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,540
in global communications.
Let's knock 'em dead.

38
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:29,280
All right.

39
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,849
Wait, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

40
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,851
Into the room with the people.

41
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,422
Wrong, that's
the adult table in there.

42
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,157
And you haven't
earned the privilege yet.

43
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,626
But I played
air hockey with him...

44
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:39,861
You need to
go back to the office

45
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,229
and file
a patent for the phone.

46
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:43,231
A patent? I don't
know how to file a patent.

47
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,066
- Figure it out.
- Can't we do that after...

48
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,068
No, and you keep talking,
I'm gonna start billing you.

49
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:48,770
And my time
runs $1,000 an hour.

50
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,738
But isn't this our time,
Mr. hand?

51
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,309
I stand corrected.

52
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:56,011
<i>Your fast times
at Ridgemont High quote,</i>

53
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,746
that proves you
belong at the adult table.

54
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,082
Hey, that's a great movie.

55
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,816
And it spoke to a generation...

56
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:16,233
Hey, you busy?

57
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,040
Okay, have you
ever filed a patent before?

58
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,608
I just got back from
this meeting with Harvey

59
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,976
and he wants me
to file this patent,

60
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,911
but I have no idea what
that paperwork looks like.

61
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,848
So... Any help in
this arena would be re...

62
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,618
Did Harvey call you
and tell you to do that?

63
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:45,428
If it isn't the golden boy.

64
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,564
You're Harvey's project, right?

65
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:50,134
What's your name?
Mike, Mike Ross.

66
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,569
Gregory Boone.

67
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,271
So what are you doing here?

68
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,308
Weren't you signing some big
deal this afternoon downtown?

69
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,478
Well, evidently I haven't
earned the privilege yet.

70
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,746
Get the adult table speech?

71
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,884
Yeah, instead of
watching the deal close,

72
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,887
I get to file the patent.

73
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,788
Yeah, those suck.

74
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,126
Wait, you... You've done
one of these before?

75
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,295
Like 100. Why?

76
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,237
Now.

77
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,173
It's okay,
you don't have to apologize.

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,941
I took care of it.

79
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,477
Patent claim.

80
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,045
I negotiated a deal
to get it done.

81
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,313
What are you talking about?

82
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,483
Gregory.
He agreed to file it for me.

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,585
And all I have to do is
proof his Bainbridge briefs.

84
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,388
Ah. That explains
why he said to give you this.

85
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,426
And why he called you a sucker.

86
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,329
He called me a what now?

87
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:54,270
Mike Ross, allow me to
introduce the Bainbridge briefs.

88
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,641
- Which stack?
- All of them.

89
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,076
Wait a minute, are these all...

90
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:01,078
Still printing, yeah.
I'd give it about a half hour.

91
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:05,016
Um... That's six printers,
23 pages a minute, 30 minutes.

92
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,720
That's 4,140 pages.
Plus all this.

93
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:10,789
Which means the next time
you negotiate a deal,

94
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,624
I would suggest
to get your facts straight.

95
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,294
Uh... I am a sucker.

96
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,899

Nice of you
to join us this morning.

107
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:56,711
For your information,
Mr. sunshine,

108
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:58,012
I've been here
all night proofing.

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,380
That belongs to... Okay.

110
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,948
Where's my confirmation?

111
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,616
What?

112
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:04,785
The fact that you don't know
already concerns me.

113
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,420
Oh, you mean the patent thing?

114
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,056
"The patent thing"
is the only piece of paper

115
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:10,423
that's holding up
our deal from yesterday.

116
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,926
Where is it?

117
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,494
It's on my desk.

118
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:16,162
Well, if it's not on mine
by the time I get back,

119
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,897
I'm gonna feed you to Louis.

120
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,968
No problem.

121
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:28,942
Please tell me
that you filed that...

122
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,477
Patent? No, not yet.

123
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:31,945
I gave it to you yesterday.

124
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,446
At the same time
I gave you my Bainbridge briefs,

125
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:34,847
which you haven't finished.

126
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,850
I was here all night,
and I barely got through half.

127
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,484
And I was on hold
for almost 11 minutes

128
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,787
before I gave up on your patent,
so what's your point?

129
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,388
I swear I will
finish those filings,

130
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,690
but you have to give me
this patent confirmation

131
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,958
before Harvey gets back.

132
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,328
Sorry, golden boy.
Deal's a deal.

133
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,147
What do you think you're doing?

134
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:11,317
Uh... I'm proofing briefs. Why?

135
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,019
Is there a problem?
Yeah, there is.

136
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,055
That's Gregory's responsibility,
why are you handling it?

137
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,124
Oh, I... Volunteered.

138
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,059
He didn't pawn it off on you?

139
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,362
No. No.

140
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,397
I mean, he didn't
even want me to do it,

141
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:27,767
but you know,
I-I-I had some extra time.

142
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,637
So I insisted.

143
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,945
Congratulations.

144
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:40,315
You've shown loyalty
to your fellow associates.

145
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,684
I know Gregory tricked you
into doing his work.

146
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,586
I wanted to see how you react
when pressed about it.

147
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,688
You held up.

148
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,390
I respect that.

149
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,125
Thanks?

150
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,326
See, but I don't
understand something now.

151
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,595
If you didn't know how
to file a patent,

152
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,297
then why didn't
you just run to Harvey?

153
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,701
He was busy.

154
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,536
But you see, Mike,
that's why you come to see me.

155
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:09,679
Look, Mike, I know...
I can come across a bit...

156
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,248
Prickly.

157
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,483
But we're a team here.

158
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,453
That means I'm here to help.

159
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,459
Okay, all right.

160
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:22,727
So can you help me now?

161
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,467
I already have.

162
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,102
Are...

163
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,005
Thank you, Louis.

164
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,514
Donna, blue is your color.

165
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,182
Is Harvey back?

166
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,218
No. Can I put this on his desk?

167
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes.

168
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,288
Will you tell him
I put it there hours ago?

169
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:52,159
What time you want me to say?

170
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,261
- 11:00 am?
- Absolutely.

171
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,865
And then maybe I can use
my access to his bank accounts.

172
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:01,235
To buy myself
a house in the Hamptons.

173
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,202
- 12:15?
- No.

174
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:13,646
You wanted to see me?

175
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:20,253
Sit down.

176
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,428
I looked through your work on
the Bainbridge briefs.

177
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,669
Spectacular.

178
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,173
You caught the discrepancies

179
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,908
between listed assets and
potential assets.

180
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,243
That had a huge impact, Mike.

181
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,112
Yeah, I know. Millions.

182
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,548
But anyone
would've caught that, right?

183
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:48,183
Um, out of the 50 associates
that are under purview,

184
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,618
not one of them
would've caught that.

185
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,620
You just have
this eye for detail, Mike.

186
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,455
I mean, no wonder
Harvey's so crazy about you.

187
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:54,623
It's amazing. I mean, I really,

188
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,291
really, seriously
appreciate that.

189
00:08:56,359 --> 00:09:00,094
Hey, thank you, Louis.

190
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,196
That's nice.

191
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:03,231
You know that I pick a...

192
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,966
Pony out of the herd
every year, don't you?

193
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,068
- A pony?
- Oh, yeah.

194
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,737
Someone who shows potential.

195
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,539
Stamp my own little
brand on him.

196
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,409
Are you that pony, Mike?

197
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,517
I...Work for Harvey.

198
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:22,718
As you should.

199
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,487
Good.

200
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,889
Well, listen,
I have some work to get to.

201
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:29,192
So maybe we can meet
for lunch tomorrow at the club.

202
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,327
Say, 1:00pm?
Uh, you know, tomorrow...

203
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,662
I know I just
posed that as a question,

204
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,730
but I really
didn't mean it that way.

205
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:43,074
Hey, what's up?

206
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:45,043
We just heard from Wyatt.

207
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,078
He got a response
from the patent office.

208
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,580
And?

209
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:50,614
It's been denied.

210
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,983
What?

211
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,218
Evidently, there was
a similar claim.

212
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,153
Wait, what do you mean?
Somebody beat us to it?

213
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,322
No, someone beat you to it.

214
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,523
They filed
less than 24 hours ago,

215
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,593
which means you filed a day
later than you said you would.

216
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,095
I tried to tell you that
I didn't know how to do that.

217
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,296
And I told you to
figure it out.

218
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,031
And I did, and it got filed.

219
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,701
After you lied and said
you'd already followed through.

220
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:17,141
Okay, what's gonna happen now?

221
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,743
I suggest you get on the phone,

222
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,145
call the patent office,
and find out who beat us to it.

223
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,715
Then you're gonna have Donna
find any judge who will listen,

224
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:25,250
so we can get an injunction,

225
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,285
and stop whoever it is from
launching their product first.

226
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:28,787
Okay, got it.

227
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,222
Now I've gotta call Wyatt
and calm him down.

228
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,023
You think that's
gonna be a walk in the park?

229
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,128
Hey, Harvey...

230
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,497
Did you tell him it was me?

231
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:42,266
Why would I do that?
I'm responsible for you.

232
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,569
It was me.

233
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,325
They signed
the paperwork, Wyatt.

234
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,826
They can't pull out.

235
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:11,395
The patent dispute
is not an issue, okay?

236
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,097
No, they cut the check.
End of story.

237
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm in court right now,
let me call you back.

238
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,802
So it's
velocity data solutions.

239
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,537
Did you serve them
with notice of the hearing?

240
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,205
A billion dollar company.

241
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:26,041
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

242
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,677
Did you not
see the sign outside?

243
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,546
I'm just putting it away,
your honor.

244
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:32,714
It should already be
in your pocket.

245
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,449
But you were
already running late,

246
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,584
so perhaps
that's why it wasn't.

247
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:39,454
Let the records show that
the counsel is fined $1,000

248
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,155
for failing to follow
the posted rules of the court.

249
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,224
- Your honor, I didn't mean...
- And for mouthing off.

250
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,826
Mouthing off?

251
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:48,230
Another outburst like that,
and you will be escorted out.

252
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,233
Wow.

253
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,538
Mr. Salinger?

254
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,140
Your honor,
this is a waste of your time.

255
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,576
The U.S. patent office
is the only judicial body

256
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:01,812
that should be
handling this dispute.

257
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,016
Velocity data solutions
requests dismissal.

258
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:08,353
Your honor. If I may?

259
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,289
- This injunction request...
- Counsel approach.

260
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,132
That's the exhibit filing?

261
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,634
Why wasn't I
given a courtesy copy?

262
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,970
Given the expedited nature
of this hearing, I...

263
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,305
Hand it to me. Hand it to me.

264
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,249
And I would've assumed
that a lawyer

265
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,184
appearing before
a judge would come on time,

266
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:44,621
with his mouth shut, and
prepared with a courtesy brief.

267
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,560
- My apologies.
- Request denied.

268
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:53,097
Court adjourned for morning.

269
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:54,866
Better luck next time, Harvey.

270
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,373
From now on, I want him
when I go against you.

271
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:06,912
Wait here.

272
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,684
- Your honor, I have...
- Send him in.

273
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,231
Counselor?

274
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,399
You asked to see me.

275
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:28,968
You must have something to say.

276
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,003
Excluding friends, associates,

277
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,305
and the clients
that I represent,

278
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,506
there are very few people

279
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,075
that I'm on
a first name basis with.

280
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:36,643
And I've never had anyone,

281
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,013
let alone
a judge I've never met,

282
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,682
address me as Harvey
in open court.

283
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,150
But if you're gonna screw me,

284
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:47,521
I guess it's only fair
that you call me by name.

285
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:48,722
I could have
you brought up on review

286
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,990
for talking to me like that.

287
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,092
Then we can
get it all on record.

288
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,362
- Get what?
- Whatever it is

289
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,798
that you seem to have against me
for no apparent reason.

290
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:59,501
I have a solid argument for
any reasonable judge

291
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:02,371
to grant my injunction.
So solid it begs the question,

292
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,373
why do you have it in for me?

293
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,141
And I don't even know
your first name.

294
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,010
Really?

295
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,512
My wife never mentioned it?
Your wife?

296
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,780
The woman you had
an affair with last month?

297
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,402
Wait, what happened in there?

298
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,270
Donna, the address for
that fundraiser

299
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,671
at the gallery last month,

300
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,974
I need you to text it to me,
and clear my afternoon.

301
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:27,077
Hey, where are we going?

302
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:28,611
You're going back
to the office to file

303
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,215
an interference claim
with the patent office.

304
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,750
Okay. Wait, what's that?

305
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:35,387
It's how they determine
who wins these situations.

306
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,589
It's not always who filed first,
so we have a chance.

307
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:38,790
So why didn't we
do that in the first place?

308
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,159
Because it takes longer,

309
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,428
and I wanted to head
velocity off at the pass.

310
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:43,596
Hey, where you going?

311
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,498
To iron out a wrinkle.

312
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:54,206
If you're really interested,
come back tomorrow around 1:00.

313
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:57,143
The afternoon light really
makes this canvas come alive.

314
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,212
Pardon me, I was wondering,
would I get a discount

315
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,314
for being the guy you
cheated on your husband with?

316
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,817
Can you excuse me for a second?

317
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,155
What are you doing here?

318
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,325
I had a hearing in front of
the judge this morning,

319
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:13,860
it didn't go very well.

320
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:16,196
Why did you lie to him?
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,964
I mean, I recall
you being tipsy that night,

322
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:19,499
but I'm finding it
hard to believe

323
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,334
that your memory is so cloudy,

324
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:22,669
you forgot
I sent you home in a cab.

325
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,004
After humiliating me.

326
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:25,505
I was the perfect gentleman.

327
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:26,973
Yes, exactly.

328
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,409
I fall all over myself
making a pass,

329
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,778
and you do the right thing
and send me home.

330
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,446
I'm sorry you felt humiliated,

331
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,381
but I told you, I don't
sleep with married women.

332
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,051
Right. The moral code.

333
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,287
No. It's too big
of a pain in the ass.

334
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,655
As evidenced by my experience
in court this morning.

335
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,857
What do you
want from me, Harvey.

336
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,292
I need you
to tell him the truth.

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,894
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

338
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,563
- Why didn't you just tell him?
- He's never gonna believe me.

339
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:51,198
And what makes you think
he'll believe me?

340
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,938
Because he'd want to.

341
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,610
Our whole marriage, Donald's
only cared about one thing.

342
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:04,446
His sterling reputation.

343
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:05,414
Never overturned.

344
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,086
I was... When he found out
you and I had...

345
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,921
He changed.

346
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,223
He looked at me
for the first time again.

347
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,725
Like I mattered.

348
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,295
I'm sorry. I can't tell him.

349
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,604
No, this is a request from
the applicant for...

350
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,373
Yes, but I have up
to a year before you...

351
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,809
- Hello... No, I can't hold...
- You ready?

352
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:38,245
I can't go to the club,
I have to do this for Harvey.

353
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:39,646
Yes, the person before you
said that I had

354
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:41,281
- to file the blue form...
- No, no, no, no.

355
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,050
We have a court reserved in
30 minutes, we have to go now.

356
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,785
Yes, I'm trying
to file the oral hearing.

357
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:47,188
But what you people
keep doing is trans... Hello?

358
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,024
Hello?

359
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,096
You work for me, too.

360
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,831
And that means
when Harvey is not here,

361
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,000
you gotta listen
to what I say, Mike.

362
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,436
Louis, this claim needs
to be filed today.

363
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,572
Harvey's orders.

364
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,441
In that case... Gregory!

365
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,110
I'm on your side, remember?

366
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,778
Watch this. Yes?

367
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,580
Hi.
Patent interference claim...

368
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,015
Can you have it filed
before we get back?

369
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,816
Cool? Thanks. Let's go.

370
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:15,853
What's with the...?

371
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:37,777
Who's winning?

372
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,379
- You need to warm up?
- No, I'm good.

373
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,149
You serve first.
Come on, show me what you got.

374
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:44,850
15-love.

375
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,318
All right,
you wanna play like that?

376
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,319
Let's do this thing. Come on.

377
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:55,828
Wait, wait.

378
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,435
Hey, Tom.

379
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:04,803
Game. Hey, Tom.

380
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,471
We should definitely
have lunch to talk about...

381
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,007
I mean, I have seen
your approach shot, man.

382
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:09,308
You have really improved.
I'm not kidding.

383
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:10,643
You know,
maybe you can play now,

384
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,312
me and my associate
were just starting up.

385
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,781
How about you two against me,
I'll just play...

386
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,016
Tom, seriously, I'll even...

387
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,385
I'll spot you three sets.

388
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:19,653
All right,
I'll see you later then.

389
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,090
- Isn't that, uh...?
- It's Tom Keller.

390
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:26,528
Yeah, the premiere
fantasy sports guy, right?

391
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,697
That's him.
Yeah, I play it ever year.

392
00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:30,765
Yeah, you and five million
other fantasy footballers.

393
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,901
I mean, the guy generates
200 million per annum, right?

394
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:37,037
And he still uses his fraternity
brother as a general counsel.

395
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:39,272
I mean, someone with that
many assets just makes me sick.

396
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,107
Okay.

397
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:43,042
So is it my serve?
Let's hit the showers.

398
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,979
But, wait...

399
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,781
Sorry, sir, but...

400
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,484
No introductions necessary,
we're on a first name basis.

401
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:52,919
I brought you a present.

402
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:55,822
Yours to keep,
after you sign my injunction.

403
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,424
- A pen.
- It's custom.

404
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,259
<i>French. Le bic.</i>

405
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:01,729
Oh, my earlier ruling
wasn't clear enough for you?

406
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,131
Crystal, but I didn't
want you to suffer for it.

407
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,300
You see,
if you don't sign my injunction,

408
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,068
there's gonna be a lawsuit.

409
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:10,037
And when the next judge
sees all the facts,

410
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,772
he's gonna overturn your ruling.

411
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,240
You may be right.

412
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:15,008
But by then your clients
will have dumped you.

413
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:17,311
You may be right,
but that sterling reputation

414
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:20,113
that you value so highly...
Down the tubes.

415
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:22,349
Which would matter,
except for one thing.

416
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,452
I've decided to leave the bench.

417
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,221
Try my hand at litigation.

418
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,223
And I'm your last case.

419
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,660
Divorce will do that.
Make you wanna change your life.

420
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:36,229
- You filed for divorce?
- Soon enough.

421
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:39,465
Perhaps we could discuss

422
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,802
a little quid pro quo
before I do.

423
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,270
I'm listening.

424
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:46,739
You sign a document that says
you slept with my wife,

425
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,674
I'll give you your injunction.

426
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,443
And why would
you want me to do that?

427
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,245
To prevent her from taking me
for half of everything I own.

428
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:57,282
So what you're saying
is you'd like to blackmail me.

429
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,784
I'm saying
we could both benefit.

430
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,619
And since you're
the one who screwed me,

431
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:04,555
I'd say you owe me one.

432
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,733
Harvey specter.

433
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,102
What are you
hiding from me, Harvey?

434
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:17,303
Wyatt, do you remember

435
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:19,005
six months ago
when you got all nervous

436
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:20,774
and you thought everything
was falling apart?

437
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:22,709
Yeah, yeah.
But this is a little different.

438
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:23,844
That's what you said then.

439
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,679
And a year ago,
and 18 months ago.

440
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:27,748
And we agreed that
when this happens again,

441
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:30,050
I'll remind you of those times

442
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:31,786
- and I'll hang up.
- Okay, Harvey...

443
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:32,887
Trust me,
it's for your own good.

444
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,722
Harvey, please don't hang up...

445
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,165
Hey, Tom.
You just missed a great game.

446
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:45,700
We were, uh...
We were just re...

447
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,602
I was beating him.

448
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,573
You know, ten years ago,

449
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:55,176
before these dot-com
millionaires,

450
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:56,611
there were men of substance
in this club.

451
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,613
You know, men who understood
how business gets done.

452
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:02,016
Well, maybe he's just not
interested in talking business

453
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:04,117
while he's in a towel.
Like, he's not interested

454
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:05,986
because he doesn't
think I'm cool.

455
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:07,354
And he's a pothead who thinks

456
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,590
that anybody who
doesn't smoke is a nerd.

457
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,959
I mean...

458
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,627
So I treat my body
like a temple?

459
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:16,663
Does that make me uncool?
I don't think so.

460
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,465
No.

461
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,400
But on the other hand...

462
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,970
You kinda seem his type.

463
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:25,738
- Why do you say that?
- Because you're young.

464
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:29,242
And you think
of yourself as... Hip.

465
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,444
Whatever, I guess.
You know, I'm sure you

466
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:35,548
enjoyed
the occasional bong hit.

467
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,351
No. No, I don't smoke.

468
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:42,556
I mean, that's just
a little strange.

469
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:43,957
Why is it strange?

470
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,393
I mean, because
the drug test that you took...

471
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:49,196
Well, that I made you take...
Would indicate otherwise.

472
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:00,106
You're not gonna
dispute it now, are you?

473
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,976
Relax, Mike.

474
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:05,077
Relax.

475
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:06,745
I'm not offended.

476
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,113
I'm not even surprised.

477
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,281
And in fact, in this instance,

478
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:10,983
we can use this
to our advantage.

479
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,451
What are you
talking about, Louis?

480
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:13,986
I'm just saying,
you know, back in the day,

481
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:15,788
to woo a client you
would take him to dinner,

482
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,089
you would buy him a drink.

483
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,490
But that's
not gonna work with Tom.

484
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,094
Not in a million years.
Not with me, anyway.

485
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:22,995
But with
someone of his generation

486
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,330
who shares
the same proclivities?

487
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:26,733
You saying you want me
to smoke pot with him?

488
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,969
I'm saying you can
help me land him as a client.

489
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,608
That's the only
reason I'm here, isn't it?

490
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,943
No, Mike. Stop.

491
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,511
Just stop, okay?

492
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:39,081
I assure you, no one was
more disappointed than me

493
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,517
when I found out the results
of your drug test, okay?

494
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,619
Then I had to say to myself,
"Louis, do what you do,

495
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:47,290
make lemonade."

496
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:50,460
And if I don't?

497
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,729
You're a smart kid.

498
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:55,398
And I really
wanna see you succeed.

499
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,208
Ball's in your court.

500
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,380
Hey, Tom, I was
just gonna tell you,

501
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,182
I wanted to... Okay.

502
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:19,055
Dude creeps me out, man.

503
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:21,024
And he never
wears a towel, ever.

504
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,725
Yeah, tell me about it.

505
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:28,631
Hey, I know you must
hear this all the time,

506
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,234
but totally addicted
to your website, man.

507
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,904
All right, who placed sixth
in passing yards last year?

508
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:36,773
Carson Palmer.

509
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,441
3,970.

510
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,109
How many sacks
did James Hall have?

511
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:41,912
11?

512
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,014
Uh-uh. Ten and a half.

513
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,316
- Yeah, I know, I rounded up.
- Well, your league doesn't

514
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,785
or I would've
come in better than 20th.

515
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,957
Your Ross's raiders, right?

516
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,659
Yeah, Mike Ross.

517
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,728
- Tom Keller.
- Good to meet you.

518
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:58,663
Congratulations, man, you
got a nice little team there.

519
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,098
Yeah.

520
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,466
No, if Roethlisberger
hadn't let you down,

521
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:02,934
you'd have been top ten
for sure, I'm telling you.

522
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,235
Yeah, well, that's what happens

523
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:06,470
when you get high
before the draft, right?

524
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,406
You get high?

525
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:47,357
How's it going with Harvey?

526
00:24:48,726 --> 00:24:49,993
Me?

527
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:53,463
Uh... It's...
You know, it's good.

528
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,131
I'm learning.

529
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,034
A lot of learning. Bye.

530
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,009
What's black and white
and gonna cost you dearly?

531
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:41,380
Took me all morning
to file this, golden boy.

532
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:43,415
You owe me
and I won't forget it.

533
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,585
Oh, God! Thank you.

534
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,921
You smell papery.

535
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,393
Wyatt,
it doesn't happen immediately.

536
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,162
The paperwork's coming.

537
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,231
Don't worry about it, okay?

538
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,234
Boom.
There you go, look at that.

539
00:26:00,302 --> 00:26:02,536
Wyatt, let me
call you back, okay?

540
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,638
Five minutes. Bye.

541
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,308
- What's this?
- What is this?

542
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,176
That's confirmation
of the interference claim

543
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:11,445
which I proofed. Up top.

544
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,347
What, you think
you're working in a fraternity?

545
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:14,815
You don't barge in here
when I'm on the phone.

546
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:18,118
And why you so flushed?

547
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,754
- Why am I so what?
- Your face is red.

548
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:22,189
It looks like
you've been in the sun.

549
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:24,058
Um... Yeah, I...

550
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,396
I... This morning, Louis
took me to the tennis club.

551
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,765
He didn't give you
the speech about the, um,

552
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,134
the ponies, did he? Oh, my God.

553
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:34,669
How he likes
to cut one from the herd.

554
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,238
The ponies.

555
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:37,506
Was he wearing the headband?

556
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:39,741
You know about the headband?
With the...

557
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,744
Oh, my God, are you
kidding me with that guy?

558
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,812
Hey, if you guys were
playing tennis all morning,

559
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,881
how'd you have time
to file this?

560
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,455
He... It was this morning...

561
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,357
Actually,
I was on the phone with them,

562
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:57,126
- and Louis helped me...
- Look at me.

563
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:59,196
And he did this
snapping thing, and Gregory...

564
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:02,032
Look at me.

565
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,938
You're high.

566
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:13,276
Get out.

567
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,579
Harvey, you don't understand.
Louis...

568
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:19,515
Out.

569
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,729
Donna?

570
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:35,565
Can you get
Wyatt back on the line?

571
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:53,916
What are you doing in here?

572
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,452
It's the ladies room.

573
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,889
I'm sorry.

574
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:02,992
Look, can you do me a favor?
Can we...

575
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,294
Can we just keep this
our little secret?

576
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:08,030
Why are your eyes so red?

577
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:14,136
I need some air.

578
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,471
You took Mike Ross on
a field trip today?

579
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:18,406
- Yep.
- Aside from subjecting him

580
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,008
to you in a towel,
what happened?

581
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:21,976
Well, I beat him in
straight sets,

582
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,578
- if that's what you're get...
- Don't play dumb, Louis.

583
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,113
Tell me what you did to him.
What're you, jealous?

584
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,181
Harvey, come on, the kid
is starving for a mentor,

585
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,549
someone to give him
some advice.

586
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,117
So maybe if you
just took the time...

587
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,319
I'm telling you right now,
you try to move in on him...

588
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:33,654
Harvey,
where is this coming from?

589
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:35,389
Harvey,
I've got the outside counsel

590
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,193
for velocity on the line.
Put them through.

591
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,670
What happened after you smoked?

592
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:48,672
- Here.
- I just got paranoid.

593
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,874
I felt bad for lying to him,

594
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:54,178
I told him that Louis
put me up to it

595
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:55,112
and that he couldn't trust him.

596
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,747
So what did he say?

597
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,283
He said that Louis
gave him the creeps anyway.

598
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,651
You know,
he's never gonna hire him.

599
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,953
Okay, you have to tell Harvey.

600
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,155
I tried, he wasn't listening.

601
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:06,991
So then go home
and tell him tomorrow.

602
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,160
Oh, God, you should've
seen his face.

603
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:11,996
We had a deal. What deal?

604
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,934
- Thanks for hearing me out.
- No, what're you talking about?

605
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:19,269
What deal? It's nothing.

606
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:22,338
I just promised that
I wouldn't...

607
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:25,041
Do anything stupid
and let him down, and I did.

608
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,377
Wait, you let him down?

609
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:28,646
No, the way I see it,
he let you down.

610
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,180
What?

611
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:31,849
He's gotta know
what Louis is capable of,

612
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,383
so if he didn't
listen to what happened

613
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:34,951
it's 'cause he didn't want to.

614
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,553
Mike, you need to tell him.

615
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,388
I don't know how often
you come across Harvey,

616
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:40,056
but he's not exactly
the listening type.

617
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:41,925
Right.

618
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,261
But he's also the first person
that would tell you

619
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,096
never to take no for an answer
from anyone.

620
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,841
Harvey, how you doing
this fine day?

621
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,878
I'm ready to hear
your settlement offer, George.

622
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:02,647
Cutting to the chase,
I like that.

623
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:06,084
What's the number?

624
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,687
Ten million.

625
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:11,424
That's half what we spent
developing the prototype.

626
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,959
And ten million
more than you'll get,

627
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:15,494
the way the wind's blowing.
Yeah, well, winds can change.

628
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:16,896
And you and I both know
the injunction

629
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:18,297
will get overturned on appeal.

630
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:19,699
I don't know
anything of the kind.

631
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,668
Then why are you calling
with an offer at all?

632
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,474
15, that's as high as I'll go.

633
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,077
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- 20 million, that's it.

634
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,213
The offer's good for 24 hours.

635
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,781
And I'm sure
I don't have to remind you

636
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:37,617
that you're legally required
to present this to your client.

637
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:47,788
Is he free?

638
00:30:47,855 --> 00:30:49,556
Not for you.

639
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:51,057
How much did he tell you?

640
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,927
He didn't have to tell me,
I read it on his face.

641
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,595
You heard him.
Maybe he did the same to me.

642
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,935
Get in there.

643
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,540
And be careful.

644
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:12,146
Harvey.

645
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:14,549
We talked about this, right?
Barging into my office.

646
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,017
I'm not leaving
until you hear me out.

647
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,853
- Wanna bet?
- You owe it to me.

648
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,922
- Oh, I owe it to you?
- Yeah.

649
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:21,423
Look, this is
not my fault, all right?

650
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:23,191
Louis made me do it.
Louis did, right.

651
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,127
He put a gun to your head
and made you smoke pot.

652
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:27,329
Yeah, he did.
He pulled out the drug test...

653
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:28,830
Which I failed, by the way.

654
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:30,465
And then he told me
that if I didn't smoke pot

655
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,301
to help him land this
new client, that he'd fire me.

656
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:37,137
Come on.

657
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,405
It's not so different
than asking someone

658
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:40,640
out for drinks, is it?
You and I had a deal.

659
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,309
I'm sorry.

660
00:31:42,377 --> 00:31:44,177
And if next time
Louis asks you to do something

661
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,580
that I told you not to do,
what then?

662
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,748
I told you that
I did not have a choice.

663
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:49,849
Oh, because
he had a gun to your head.

664
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,217
- Yes!
- What are your choices

665
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,652
if someone
puts a gun to your head?

666
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,187
What are you talking about?
You do what they say

667
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:55,588
or they shoot you. Wrong.

668
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,791
You take the gun,
or you pull out a bigger one,

669
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,292
or you call their bluff.

670
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,994
Or you do any one of
146 other things.

671
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:03,195
If you can't
think for yourself,

672
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:04,663
maybe you
aren't cut out for this.

673
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,932
No, I can and I am.
Look, I did what I had to do.

674
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,767
I made the best out
of a bad situation.

675
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:10,236
Which is what I am good at.

676
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,971
Which is what you hired me
to do in the first place.

677
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:14,172
Yeah, I hired you
and I expect your loyalty.

678
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,374
So if Louis asks you to do
something like that,

679
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:18,276
you come to me first.
Oh, right.

680
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:20,545
Like when I came to you
and you told me

681
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:22,113
that I couldn't sit
at the adult table, right.

682
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,182
I remember that.
Or-or when you told me

683
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,884
to go file the patent
by myself, like that?

684
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,786
- Excuse me?
- You know what?

685
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:30,622
Maybe it's time
you showed me some loyalty.

686
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,227
Do you know how long it was

687
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,430
before I got
to sit at the adult table?

688
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:38,899
It was when
I brought in my first client.

689
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:41,168
Which I don't recall
you having done.

690
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:43,737
And when you screwed up
that patent

691
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:45,672
and Wyatt went ape shit on me,

692
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,707
I didn't put that on you,
I took it on myself.

693
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,343
Because that's my job.

694
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,012
And it's your job to do
what I say when I say it.

695
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,281
So if you're
talking about loyalty,

696
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,184
you better goddamn earn it.

697
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:03,357
You're right.

698
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:06,160
I said I'm sorry and
I meant it.

699
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:09,730
Harvey...

700
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:12,968
I want you to tr...
I need you to trust me, okay?

701
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:14,670
And I will
work as long as I can,

702
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:17,073
as hard as it takes
to make that happen.

703
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:18,374
I mean,

704
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:19,542
you don't even
have to pay me, all right?

705
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,945
I'll work for free.

706
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:24,313
For free.

707
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:26,382
What, I meant... Not forever.

708
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,917
Just as, like,
a probationary thing.

709
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,618
Donna,
tell Wyatt I'm on my way over.

710
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:30,953
Do you never
have to press a button?

711
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:32,187
Got it.
And Jessica wants to see

712
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:33,188
Mike in her office right now.

713
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,593
Louis told me
what you did at the club.

714
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,197
I bet he didn't
tell you the whole story.

715
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:44,733
He told me enough
to impress me.

716
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,240
Your new business is hard.

717
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:52,909
People will
promise you the world

718
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:54,878
but until they
sign that engagement letter,

719
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:58,348
it means nothing.

720
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,118
Now I don't know
what you told Tom Keller,

721
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:04,222
but bring a client in
at your age...

722
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,590
That reminds me of Harvey.

723
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,860
Jessica, before we get started,

724
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:10,928
there's
something in the retainer

725
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:12,396
that Tom pointed out.

726
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:13,630
It's not a big deal, really.

727
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:14,998
- We were just...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

728
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:16,700
Like I said,
we're here to make you happy.

729
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,636
Right?

730
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,976
I thought you
wanted nothing to do with him?

731
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,178
I didn't.
But then I thought about it.

732
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,847
And he might not
be a very good person,

733
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,449
but a little deviousness

734
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,384
is the sort of thing
you look for in a good lawyer.

735
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:35,453
I mean, the other guy
I was with, he was too nice.

736
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:38,156
We were buddies,
we went to school together.

737
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:39,824
It's time I grew up,
got a real shark.

738
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:42,027
Well, I had no intention

739
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,829
of being that way
to get your business.

740
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:47,132
That's exactly why I insisted
that you be my point man.

741
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,501
I want someone
being devious for me,

742
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:50,469
not to me.

743
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:54,707
What? It's just...

744
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:57,009
Louis would've never
told Jessica that I existed,

745
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,245
let alone that I helped him
if you hadn't done that.

746
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:02,147
Hey, the way I see it,
the three of us stick together,

747
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:03,348
we'll make a pretty good team.

748
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:08,554
You know, I got a better idea.

749
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:10,022
$20 million?

750
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,524
They claim
it's their final offer.

751
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:14,193
That's what it cost to
make the prototype.

752
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:18,231
Not to mention my entire savings
and two years of my life.

753
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:20,165
Wyatt...

754
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,668
They know we're stalled
on our injunction.

755
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:25,837
Which means, to them,
they're giving you a fair price

756
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:28,507
as an insurance policy
against the risk of possibly

757
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,676
losing the interference claim.

758
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:32,778
I don't care
what it is to them.

759
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:36,081
It's not fair.

760
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:38,951
Fair or not,
it's their final offer.

761
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:46,558
You think I should take it?

762
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,395
I think you should tell them
to shove it up their ass.

763
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:53,853
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm terribly sorry,

764
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,955
but we have a problem.

765
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,389
What problem?

766
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,224
We came down here
because you led us to believe

767
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,693
that your client
was ready to accept

768
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,928
our settlement agreement.
And I thought he would.

769
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,863
Look, I took him the offer.

770
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:08,099
I presented it to him,
and recommended that he take it.

771
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,367
In fact,
I urged him to take it.

772
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,202
You know what he told me to do?

773
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,137
He told me to tell you to
shove it up your ass.

774
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,543
Now I know you didn't have
me come all the way down here

775
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,912
just to tell me that.

776
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,582
You're right.
That's not all Wyatt said.

777
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,384
He said rather than
spending years

778
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:28,154
fighting this out in court,
in 48 hours

779
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:31,324
he's gonna put this online.

780
00:36:33,295 --> 00:36:35,896
That's a little rough,
but you get the idea.

781
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:38,266
What are you showing us?
Is this a website?

782
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:40,935
Available at
the Suntech domain name.

783
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,204
All the design plans and
calculations have been uploaded.

784
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,073
- Is this online now?
- Can be.

785
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,575
Which means the whole world
will have access to my designs.

786
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:49,677
They'll be ten knock-offs
of that phone

787
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,713
before you can catch
a cab back to your headquarters.

788
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,682
- We could file an injunction.
- Not before tomorrow.

789
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,318
And once
that technology is out there,

790
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:58,786
good luck putting
that genie back in the bottle.

791
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:00,421
Well, then we'll sue.

792
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,090
But my client won't
have any money.

793
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,826
What he will have is credit
for the initial design.

794
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:07,729
Which, after he incorporates
under a different name,

795
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:09,664
will be worth
a hell of a lot more money

796
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,433
than the $20 million that
you're offering.

797
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:18,373
And you're saying that
this was all your client's idea.

798
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,010
Yes.

799
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:26,113
That's what I'm saying.

800
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,061
Thought you weren't coming.

801
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,697
I had to settle a case first.

802
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:46,433
You have the paperwork
we talked about?

803
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,113
What is this?

804
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,248
It's a copy of
the judicial conduct codes.

805
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:02,483
A friend of mine works at
the Attorney General's office

806
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,251
gave it to me.
We had a nice chat about you.

807
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,788
I told him if you were willing
to blackmail someone once,

808
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,255
chances are
you'd done it before.

809
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,324
He's very anxious to meet you.

810
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,226
You think you can
get away with screwing my wife

811
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,027
and then have me investigated?

812
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:16,696
You actually have it
the wrong way around.

813
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:18,898
The only thing I've done so far

814
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,533
is have you investigated.

815
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,502
What?

816
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,804
I never
actually slept with Lauren.

817
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,673
But I knew
you'd never believe me

818
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:28,275
so I kept my mouth shut.

819
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:29,877
But now that
she's getting a divorce,

820
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,579
my policy no longer applies.

821
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:34,983
And of course, she's free to
date whoever she pleases.

822
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:38,887
And she pleases me.

823
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:41,789
Enjoy your evening, Donald.

824
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:07,016
I've always
heard about this place.

825
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:09,485
Which room is hoffa buried in?

826
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:11,520
Not sure, but...

827
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:15,257
The arc of the covenant's
just down the hall on the left.

828
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:16,525
When you're finished down here,

829
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:17,960
I'd like you to come upstairs

830
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:21,364
and start putting together
a settlement memorandum.

831
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,866
- They went for it?
- Thanks to your idea.

832
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:26,268
Well, I mean,
it wasn't really my idea...

833
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:27,569
They're settling for
400 million.

834
00:39:27,637 --> 00:39:29,038
Okay, yeah, that was my idea.

835
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:33,175
So does this mean
I get to keep my job?

836
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:34,543
I wanna talk to you about that.

837
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:36,212
- Before you do, Harvey...
- Do we have to have

838
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,613
a conversation about
how you keep interrupting me?

839
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:42,752
Look, sometimes when
someone pulls a gun on you,

840
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:46,589
instead of bullets
it's filled with blanks.

841
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:48,024
What's this?

842
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,959
It's a copy of
your drug test results.

843
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:52,094
But this says I passed.

844
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:54,831
You did.

845
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:57,000
Louis showed me a fake?

846
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,301
I'm gonna go
have a talk with him.

847
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:04,107
You know what,
why don't you let me do it?

848
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:05,608
You think you're ready
for the adult table?

849
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:08,578
What, didn't you hear?
I just landed my first client.

850
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:10,680
Why do you think
I'm showing you this now

851
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:11,848
and not going straight
to Louis?

852
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:18,254
Go easy on him. Nope.

853
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:21,056
Good boy.

854
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:24,860
You lied.

855
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,495
That other drug test
you showed me was a fake.

856
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:27,829
How'd you figure that out?

857
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,964
Someone once told me
I have an eye for detail

858
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:31,599
when it comes
to important paperwork.

859
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,434
Well, maybe you're not
as good as you think you are,

860
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,969
or you
would've caught it sooner.

861
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:37,405
Okay, so this was
all some sort of test?

862
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:39,773
You blackmail me,
you jeopardize my job?

863
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,475
Mike, stop. Stop.

864
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,443
We all came out ahead,
didn't we?

865
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:45,244
That new client's
gonna bring us millions.

866
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,947
Jessica knows your name now.

867
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:48,515
It's a win-win.

868
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:53,118
You're right.

869
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,253
She does know my name.

870
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:57,355
Which is why she'll listen
when I tell her

871
00:40:57,423 --> 00:40:59,090
exactly what happened.

872
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:03,060
Okay, but before you do that

873
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,763
it is... That time again,
isn't it?

874
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,231
What time?

875
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,900
Pee in a cup time.

876
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,637
And now you know I'd fail.

877
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,871
Of course,
you can run to mommy,

878
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,473
tell her your story,
and take your chances.

879
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,809
Or you can
take the test and trust

880
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,612
that I'll keep it to myself
as my way of thanking you.

881
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,796
Ah, you know,
I actually did some reading

882
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:39,698
of the Pearson-harmon
drug policy as well.

883
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:42,301
It turns out that you
have to wait three months

884
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:44,102
before you can
request another drug test.

885
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,071
See, it's a little detail that
you might've missed.

886
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,973
So, drink up.

887
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,643
Oh, and I spoke to Tom Keller.

888
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,445
He says that he feels
he'd be best served

889
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,747
with a combination of
me and Harvey.

890
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,550
I think you'll get
that call in the morning.
