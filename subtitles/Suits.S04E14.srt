00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,499
And I can't remember the last
time you took a vacation.

162
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,101
When's the last time
you took a vacation?

163
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,069
I'm not the one
in a serious relationship.

164
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,538
Oh, so you're playing matchmaker
for me now?

165
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,441
And you were the one
who said you had to choose

166
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,477
Between hiring him
and continuing to see him.

167
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,745
And then I changed my mind.

168
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,647
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

169
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,083
What are you talking about?

170
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,752
I should have taken
some time with scottie.

171
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,587
Jeff and I are not
you and scottie.

172
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,955
Jessica, take a vacation.

173
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,490
Don't take a vacation.

174
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,825
The man came in here,

175
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,093
Asking me for help because
he wants to go away with you,

176
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,163
And I said yes because I'm not
gonna be the reason he can't.

177
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,540
[phone ringing]

178
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,944
(receptionist) pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

179
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,747
[phone ringing]

180
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,951
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

181
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,124
- Louis, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

182
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,027
Okay.
What are you doing?

183
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,230
(receptionist on speaker) pearson
specter, how may I direct your call?

184
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,732
Pearson specter,
how may I direct your call?

185
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,133
You hear...

186
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:27,873
Hello?
Pearson specter...

187
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,508
You hear that?

188
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,076
Where's the litt?

189
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,944
Every call is like a slap
in the face.

190
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,146
Louis, it's standard practice
for a law firm

191
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,548
To shorten their name
on the phone.

192
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,517
So blatant disrespect
is standard practice now?

193
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,951
It's not disrespect.
It's just...

194
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,020
You're telling me
that your father doesn't

195
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,054
Have them answer the phone,

196
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,823
"rand, kaldore, zane"?

197
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,124
Actually, no, he doesn't,

198
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,728
And I think you'd agree
that people respect my father.

199
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,929
Unless you want to go back
to telling me

200
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,130
That he's a shady lawyer.

201
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,032
Come on, rachel,
that was when I was mad at you.

202
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,169
Which is actually why I wanted
to come and talk to you.

203
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,607
I want to thank you
for forgiving mike.

204
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,044
It... it means a lot to me.

205
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,779
Now, can you stop
obsessing over the phone

206
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,181
Long enough to hear that?

207
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm sorry, rachel,

208
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,884
But I can't,

209
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,786
And now I have to go rip
that receptionist a new ass...

210
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,822
Louis, if one of your first acts
as name partner

211
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,659
Is to rip the receptionist
to shreds,

212
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,894
You'll regret that
for the rest of your life.

213
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,696
- Just let it go.
- [inhales]

214
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,200
Things will run their course.

215
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,202
You know what, rachel?
You're right.

216
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,240
And by the way, I'm glad
that we're friends again.

217
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,619
Pearson specter...

218
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,025
Harvey, what are you doing
at 3:30 this afternoon?

219
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,729
I have some news, and I don't
want you to overreact.

220
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,731
What is it?

221
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:02,067
Jeffrey bender
wants to meet with you.

222
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,735
He heard we're taking
a whistle-blower case,

223
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,738
And he wants us to drop it.

224
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,908
Relax, I'll take care
of jeffrey bender.

225
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,042
Wait a second,
you're not gonna try

226
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,877
To cut mike's legs
out from under him

227
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,179
- Before he even gets started?
- What's the point?

228
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,781
He'd just bother me
until I agreed not to anyway.

229
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,286
I can't believe it.

230
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,822
You have no idea what to say.

231
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,024
What's the date today?
I want to write this down.

232
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,859
You know what?

233
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,327
It's the seventh of kiss my ass,

234
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,664
And tomorrow is the eighth of
set your own goddamn meetings.

235
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,932
Is that the mayan calendar?

236
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,967
Nope, that's the donna calendar.

237
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,803
I got you.
For the record, I got you.

238
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,109
All right, take me
through it one more time.

239
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,211
It's simple.

240
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:49,648
There are axles on all the cars
in all the trains,

241
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,417
And those axles have sensors to
make sure they don't overheat.

242
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,985
So you're saying
that the train crashed

243
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,253
Because the heat sensors failed.

244
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,789
I'm saying
that all the heat sensors

245
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,291
On the entire fleet were faulty,

246
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,793
And they knew about it.

247
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,294
Then why didn't you
come forward with this before?

248
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,797
You mean before they fired me
for coming forward with it?

249
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,199
Which brings me
to my next question.

250
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,801
You've had four different jobs
in the last six years.

251
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,803
What are you getting at?

252
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,971
I want to know why.

253
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,139
I move around.

254
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,440
It's not uncommon
in my business.

255
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,043
Move around or keep failing?

256
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,278
I got fired
for blowing the whistle,

257
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,846
Not for messing up on the job.

258
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,815
That's not what your last
performance review says.

259
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,684
I don't give a shit
what it says.

260
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,786
They used that as an excuse
to fire me,

261
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:30,221
And my reviews
before I came forward

262
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,956
Passed with flying colors.

263
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,058
I'm a solid worker.

264
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,325
How the hell do you think
I got this?

265
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,194
I know your reviews are stellar.

266
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,196
What I need to know is
if there's anything out there

267
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,331
That we don't have, because
they are gonna come at us

268
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,801
Any way they can,
and when they do,

269
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,235
It's not gonna
be about heat sensors.

270
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,870
It's gonna be about you.

271
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah, I don't care if
I'm the worst guy in the world.

272
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,209
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

273
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,344
That knows
those sensors are faulty.

274
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,348
What are you talking about?

275
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,184
(harvey) what do you
mean, there's a report?

276
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,353
Done after the crash
that showed a defective part

277
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,923
Was the real cause,
not engineer error.

278
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,057
Says the whistle-blower.

279
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,960
Says these.

280
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,462
That's a memo
ordering the report

281
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,298
And another email
acknowledging its existence.

282
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,733
We got 'em.

283
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,267
- We do.
- Set a meeting.

284
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,336
Let them do the talking,
then drop the hammer,

285
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,804
And stick a settlement
down their throat

286
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,273
I appreciate the advice, harvey,

287
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,275
But this time I'm going in
with the hammer in my hand,

288
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,044
And I am coming out swinging.

289
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,946
Okay, big talker,
how much you asking for?

290
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,748
40 million.

291
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,015
Are you kidding me?

292
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,351
They'll pay ten times that
without even trying.

293
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,853
Not when I tell them
they're gonna have to admit

294
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,087
What they did.

295
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,956
- Are you nuts?
- No, I am not.

296
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,290
We are not sealing
this settlement,

297
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,826
And before you say another word,
this is my case.

298
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,028
I don't care whose case it is.

299
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,829
They're never going to admit
what they did.

300
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,364
Pick a higher number
and let them seal it.

301
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,800
Harvey, you told me to prove
this wasn't a shakedown.

302
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,069
Now you want me to take money
to cover things up?

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,871
You know what that is?
A shakedown!

304
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,440
A shakedown is when
your case has no merit.

305
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,841
This is the way things work.

306
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,445
We don't have to worry
about scaring away our clients.

307
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,213
That's why
it's the way things work.

308
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,282
Harvey, people died
in this crash!

309
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,985
And they're not coming back, no
matter what liberty rail admits.

310
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,953
You are such a cold,
heartless son of a bitch.

311
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,822
And this isn't
about your parents,

312
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,791
So back them
into whatever corner you want,

313
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,526
But when they refuse
to admit what they did,

314
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,362
You are not going to trial.

315
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,101
Stay out of my case.

blackmailing you,

00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,508
You're gonna
have a career behind bars.

474
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,842
You're not here for that report.

475
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,312
You're here to strong arm
my client into a big, fat check.

476
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,646
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

477
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,549
But a big, fat check
isn't gonna get you out of this.

478
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,951
- Is that a fact?
- Sure as hell is,

479
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,452
Because we both know that report

480
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,754
Says you're responsible
for this accident,

481
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,856
And we're not settling anything
without you admitting it.

482
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,893
And we're not admitting
something we didn't do.

483
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,696
What the hell is this?

484
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:32,930
Well, you wanted the report.

485
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,599
Here it is.

486
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,500
Your client wasn't lying
about its existence.

487
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,436
He was just lying
about everything else.

488
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,438
We ran repeated tests
on our heat sensors,

489
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,273
And they passed every one.

490
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,309
This is bullshit.

491
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,377
The only thing that's bullshit

492
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,845
Is joe henderson.

493
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,513
He doesn't care
about the accident.

494
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,282
All he's trying to do
is shake us down,

495
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,851
Exactly like he did
at his last four jobs.

496
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,656
What the hell is that?

497
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,325
His last four lawsuits.

498
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,727
Did you think we wouldn't
find out about them

499
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,428
Just because the records
were sealed?

500
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,497
Mr. Ross,
your client's been playing

501
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,599
The whistle-blower lottery
for years.

502
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,967
He's never won before.

503
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,869
He's not going to win today.

504
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,448
Ch,
you tried to blow the whistle

505
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,486
At every job you've ever had,
and now they know it!

506
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,855
Keep your voice down.

507
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,590
You...
No, I'll keep my voice down

508
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,891
When you stop bullshitting me.

509
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,360
Those claims were
supposed to be sealed.

510
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,962
I don't care what they were
supposed to be.

511
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,898
They found them, and you were
supposed to tell me about them.

512
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,867
And what would you
have done if I did?

513
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,335
I would've said what they said,

514
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,003
That you don't give a shit
about what they did!

515
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,538
You're just looking to get rich.

516
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,373
You think I would've
risked my job

517
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,742
And everything that I have
for nothing?

518
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,777
Excuse me?

519
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,779
I said, I don't see you

520
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,547
Working out of the goodness
of your heart

521
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,582
In your $1,000 suit.

522
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,786
You have no idea
who I am or why I do things.

523
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,855
And I told you, you don't have
to be concerned about my history

524
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,858
Because what
I'm telling you is true.

525
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,694
Not according to this.

526
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,996
That's the report that you said
gave us all the leverage

527
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,998
And they say
proves them innocent.

528
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,833
That report is bullshit,

529
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,569
Because I'm telling you,
those sensors didn't work,

530
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,037
And that was the cause
of that accident.

531
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,472
Well, I might have
a leg to stand on

532
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,607
If you had
any credibility at all.

533
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,476
How the hell am I supposed
to get a jury to believe you

534
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,511
When I'm not even sure I do?

535
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,655
What are you doing here?

536
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,390
I'm here to tell you
to call the front desk.

537
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,094
Jessica told you
they won't say my name

538
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,595
And you thought
it was hilarious.

539
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,730
You're right, I did.

540
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,866
And go laugh somewhere else?

541
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,468
Oh, you want to hit me now?

542
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,470
Yeah, well, why don't you go
ask mike ross about my headlock?

543
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,638
'Cause it's a goddamn vice.

544
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,944
[phone ringing over speaker]

545
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:00,945
(receptionist)
pearson specter litt,

546
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,980
How may I direct your call?

547
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,019
It was you.

548
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,521
Yes, it was me,

549
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,023
But I fixed it, so...

550
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,959
You can stop worrying
if everybody at the firm

551
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:18,028
Respects you, because they do.

552
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,001
Everyone except you.

553
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,443
No, louis, including me.

554
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,879
Listen, I may not like how
you got your name on the wall,

555
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,548
But that doesn't mean
it shouldn't be up there.

556
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,753
Congratulations, louis.

557
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,623
Thanks, jeff.

558
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,492
Hey, maybe we can even
get drinks this week.

559
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,930
- Name partner buys.
- Deal.

560
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,632
Done.

561
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,972
You can leave the coffee,
but I'm not getting up.

562
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,442
Mike, you've been working
for seven hours straight.

563
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,843
You need a break.

564
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,545
I've been working for seven
hours because if I tell harvey

565
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,913
What's going on
before I have a fix,

566
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,147
He is gonna pull the plug.

567
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,916
Well, then maybe the plug
needs to be pulled.

568
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,717
Rachel, just because
joe henderson is

569
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,785
A bullshit plaintiff
doesn't mean

570
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,953
They didn't cover things up.

571
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,756
It doesn't mean that they did.

572
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,191
Okay, fine.

573
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:21,492
Why would he ask for that report

574
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,061
If he knew
it would hurt our case?

575
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,563
- I don't know.
- I don't know either,

576
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,064
Which is why I need more time.

577
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,166
Well, then you need to convince
harvey to let you keep going,

578
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,835
Because if you don't
and he finds out...

579
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,203
He is not gonna find out.

580
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,172
Mike, he's not gonna
find out from me,

581
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,575
But if I've learned one thing
in the last six months

582
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:41,679
Of working here, it's that if
he finds out from somebody else,

583
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,081
You're gonna regret it.

584
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,555
You come here to tell me
you're taking that vacation?

585
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,257
I came by to ask
when mike ross started taking

586
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,259
Whistle-blower cases.

587
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Jessica...

588
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,727
I want you
to put the brakes on him

589
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,895
Before this gets out of control.

590
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,864
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

591
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,665
- Harvey.
- Jessica, it's one case.

592
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,101
He asked me to trust him,
and I'm gonna do it,

593
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,504
And if you're ever gonna
be able to enjoy a vacation,

594
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,640
You're gonna have to trust me.

595
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,910
All right.
Good night.

596
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,179
Bon voyage.

597
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,281
You do know
that doesn't mean "good night."

598
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,649
Of course I do.

599
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,651
Do you know how to say
"good night" in french?

600
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,153
What, do you think
I'm some kind of neanderthal?

601
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,557
You don't know one word
of french, do you?

602
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,627
You're an idiot.

603
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,063
<i>Ménage à quatre.</i>

604
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,932
<i>Ménage à cinq.</i>

605
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,669
Can I come in?

606
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,843
What's going on?

607
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:46,845
We have a problem.

608
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,913
I'm listening.

609
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,849
Liberty rail's report
directly contradicts our claim.

610
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,183
That's a big damn problem.

611
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,852
I believe my client, harvey.

612
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,020
Based on what, your gut?

613
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,855
No, I found the guy
who wrote the report.

614
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,224
He's on indefinite leave
in australia,

615
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,926
Where we can't subpoena him.

616
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,827
So it's our word against theirs.

617
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,596
Which is why I'm here.

618
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,035
Joe henderson made four other
claims in the last six years.

619
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,269
- You're shitting me.
- Harvey...

620
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,638
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

621
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,873
I knew it.

622
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,641
I knew you would bail on me
the second this thing

623
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,742
Hit the smallest bump.

624
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,910
Bail on you?

625
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,912
I backed you because you told me
you had a case.

626
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,648
I do have a case.
I told you they got to this guy.

627
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,716
And you got no proof of that.

628
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:26,784
And if this were your case,

629
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,752
You would be begging me
for help to get it.

630
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,187
It's not my case.
It's yours.

631
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,822
And now you're asking a jury

632
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:36,293
Based on the word
of a career whistle-blower.

633
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,095
No, I'm asking you
to believe it.

634
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,697
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

635
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,665
This guy is
a goddamn shakedown artist,

636
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,667
And I'm pulling the plug.

637
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,867
I don't care what he is.

638
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,937
I'm not
a goddamn shakedown artist!

639
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,272
Mike...

640
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:53,277
Harvey, you told me that
those people weren't my parents,

641
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,379
But they are somebody's parents.

642
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,050
Please.

643
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,654
You got 24 hours.

644
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,008
You know it's against the law
to litter, don't you?

645
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,342
What do you want, donna?

646
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,710
I know you went to see harvey.

647
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,078
You know that
he wants me to fail.

648
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,346
That's not true.

649
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,348
I don't have anything,
and he only gave me a day.

650
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,416
And if he wanted you to fail,

651
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,285
He wouldn't have given you
another second.

652
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,855
You know he thinks
this is about my parents, right?

653
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,960
Is it?

654
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,433
Maybe it is,

655
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,902
But what these people did
is a million times worse

656
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,104
Because they knew
it could happen.

657
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,706
Wait a second...
They knew this could happen,

658
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,974
And they didn't fix it before?

659
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:59,043
Yeah, donna, and then they...
They rolled the dice.

660
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,177
Well, what about now?

661
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,278
Are those trains
still messed up?

662
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,813
Because that would
make them monsters.

663
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,715
They are monsters, but that
would also make them idiots,

664
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:05,816
And they're not idiots.

665
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:06,950
Well, what are you
talking about?

666
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,352
Well, they must have
fixed the sensors by now;

667
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,220
Otherwise if it happened again,
they'd all go to jail.

668
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,922
Well, if they fixed the sensors,
then there has to be

669
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,090
- A paper trail.
- Of course there is.

670
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,458
Then all you have to do
is get it.

671
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,694
What do you think I've been
trying to figure out all night?

672
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,328
What's to figure out?
Subpoena it.

673
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,732
Yeah, there's only one problem.
Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

674
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,833
But now that
you've come up with this,

675
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,301
Maybe harvey
will change his mind.

676
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,704
Donna, I have a theory that
I can't prove and an opposition

677
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,272
That's shown they're willing
to alter evidence.

678
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,075
He's not gonna change his mind,
and you know it.

679
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,743
There's got to be another way.

680
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,879
Donna, look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

681
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,782
But unless you have this other
way in your pocket, please,

682
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,485
Just leave me alone
and let me try

683
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,221
And think this thing through.

684
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,934
[sighs]

685
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,975
(donna)
no! I don't care what he says.

686
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,376
It's an active
goddamn investigation,

687
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,377
And I'm not gonna
stand around...

688
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,412
You can't talk on that here.

689
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,847
Hang on a second, charlie.

690
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,949
I'm sorry, we got off
on the wrong foot.

691
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,484
Is your name danielle?

692
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,285
That's what it says
on the plate, isn't it?

693
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,287
Well, danielle, I'm here
to pick up the documents

694
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,423
I ordered an hour ago,
and if you don't give them to me

695
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,791
In the next 15 seconds,

696
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,192
Today's gonna be your last day.

697
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,227
You didn't talk to me.

698
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,996
I said hold on, damn it.

699
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:29,233
Look, I don't have time
to play "who spoke to who."

700
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,468
I am up from do because,
as it is, these documents

701
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,203
Weren't sent
when they were promised.

702
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,438
I'm sorry.
What is it you need again?

703
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,807
Oh, Jesus christ.

704
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,443
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

705
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,812
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

706
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,947
Well, then by all means,
let's call your supervisor,

707
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,550
And we can tell him
how you'd rather play<i> farmville</i>

708
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,418
Than cooperate with me.

709
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,891
Who did you say
you're with again?

710
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,927
Have you heard of the national
transportation safety board?

711
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,399
They'll give you
what you need in the back.

712
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,237
[door entrance buzzer sounds]

713
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,285
What did you do?

714
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,220
I didn't do anything.
What did you do?

715
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,222
Don't give me that.

716
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,056
This makes my entire case,

717
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,192
But I can't use it if
I don't know where it came from.

718
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,227
Oh, that looks like
it came from liberty rail.

719
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,863
Oh, oh, yeah,
it just happened to walk itself

720
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,932
Over from their secure facility.

721
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,900
Well, it's possible that
somebody went over there

722
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,869
And released it
from their secure facility.

723
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,305
Donna, if I go to harvey
with this and tell him

724
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,506
What I know happened, he...

725
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,107
You don't know.
You think.

726
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:47,077
Don't lawyer me.
He'll never let me use it.

727
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,246
Well, then don't tell him
what you think happened,

728
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,382
Because if you do,
he'll make you drop the case.

729
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,319
Okay, right now,
I don't care about the case.

730
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,522
I care about you.

731
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,159
Mike, I didn't steal anything.

732
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,195
Did you tell them
this was discovery

733
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,197
For a case against them?

734
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,432
Then it's not admissible
in court.

735
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,000
Well, then you
have to figure out a way

736
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:13,237
To use it not in court,

737
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,872
But don't ask me
for my help on that.

738
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,907
I have done enough.

739
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,519
Hey.

740
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,555
Heard you wanted to see me.

741
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,124
I take it you patched things up
with louis litt.

742
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,259
How do you know?

743
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,527
Oh, he wanted to know
if you were a sports bar guy

744
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,131
Did you tell him I'm more
of a strip club kind of guy?

745
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,367
You really want to go
to a strip club with louis litt?

746
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,503
I don't really want to go
to a strip club with anyone,

747
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,971
But I do have a meeting
in 10 minutes,

748
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:48,973
And it's 15 minutes away.

749
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,140
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

750
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,509
That I appreciate you
patching things up with him.

751
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,378
There's no need to thank me.

752
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,414
I would do anything
for the woman that I love...

753
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,518
Even get a drink
with louis litt.

754
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,232
You here to talk
about anderton software?

755
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,567
Because your 24-hour
liberty rail pass is up.

756
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,669
Then I guess it's a good thing

757
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,671
That just came
in the mail for me.

758
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:21,673
What is it?

759
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,040
Maintenance records showing

760
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,942
They replaced the heat sensors
on all of their trains

761
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,277
Within six weeks
after the derailment.

762
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,513
Now, why would they do that if
they never failed a safety test?

763
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,549
Which means joe henderson
was telling the truth.

764
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,984
I can think
of three different ways

765
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,319
They'll explain this away.

766
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,389
Not if we can get them on record
before they know we have it.

767
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,325
And why don't they know
we have it?

768
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:42,659
The same way I didn't know
they got

769
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,061
Joe henderson's sealed records.

770
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,462
Which means you did
something sketchy.

771
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,165
Harvey, do you want to spend
all night asking me exactly

772
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,333
What I did or did not do,

773
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,668
Or do you want
to help me right a wrong?

774
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,407
Donna?

775
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,309
Set a deposition
with liberty rail,

776
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,446
And tell them this time
it won't just be mike.

777
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,314
I'm on it.

778
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,493
(harvey) who the hell is that?

779
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,128
That's the ceo of liberty rail.

780
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,263
Yeah, I know who he is.
Who is she?

781
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,999
That's their lawyer.

782
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,633
Why didn't you tell me
she was hot?

783
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,168
Because it's not relevant.

784
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,603
- It is to me.
- Why?

785
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,405
Because she's hot.

786
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,474
You must be
the infamous harvey specter.

787
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,576
- You must be...
- Evan smith.

788
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,311
Have to admit,
when I saw your name was evan,

789
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,179
I thought you were a man.

790
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,647
And I have to admit,
when I saw your name was harvey,

791
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,116
I thought you were a man.

792
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,118
- I think I'm in love.
- I think you are too.

793
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,586
Okay, can we get this over with?

794
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,221
We sure can.

795
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,123
I don't even know how you
have any questions at all,

796
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,190
Given our last meeting.

797
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,525
We just have a few.

798
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,698
(mike) mr. Mcintyre,
before the derailment,

799
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,734
Liberty rail conducted tests on
the heat sensors on its trains.

800
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,570
- Of course we did.
- And why was that?

801
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,807
We run tests on all our systems.

802
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,275
It's routine.

803
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,576
And the finding of that report

804
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,712
Is that there were no problems
with the heat sensors.

805
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,280
Are you going to just
ask questions

806
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,381
That you already
know the answers to?

807
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,783
It's routine.

808
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,518
There weren't any problems
with the sensors.

809
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,487
And do you routinely
replace the heat sensors?

810
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,789
Yes.

811
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,357
We replace them every five years

812
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,292
As part of our regularly
scheduled maintenance.

813
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,294
And when was the last
regularly scheduled maintenance?

814
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,762
That would be two years ago.

815
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,097
And you wouldn't fix something
that wasn't broken, right?

816
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,266
[chuckles]

817
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,401
Of course not.

818
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,537
I'm not in the business
of wasting money, gentlemen.

819
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,772
I'm a bit confused.

820
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,108
If you're not in the business
of wasting money

821
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,709
And there was nothing wrong
with those sensors,

822
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,711
Then why did you just
replace all of them?

823
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,413
They didn't replace all of them.

824
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,782
I think we'd like your client
to answer that question.

825
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,686
You're in a bit
of a pickle, richard.

826
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,555
You don't know whether to say
you did or you didn't.

827
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,423
Of course, you could roll
the dice with your own life

828
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,791
Just like you did
with other people's.

829
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,693
The truth is, it doesn't matter,

830
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,295
Because you already
said on camera

831
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,429
You didn't replace
those sensors.

832
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,531
And we have these.

833
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,176
Where'd you get these?

834
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,778
I'll tell you
what I told joe henderson.

835
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,280
It doesn't matter
where they came from.

836
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,217
It just matters
that they're here.

837
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,651
I need to talk to my client.

838
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,220
That's a good idea.

839
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:24,488
You should discuss
how many zeros

840
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,822
You're gonna write
on that check.

841
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,291
You're not only gonna
write a check.

842
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,426
You're gonna
write a public admission

843
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,728
Because people died
in that crash.

844
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,296
That's not how this works.

845
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:39,169
It's how it works today.

846
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,804
(mike) you're really gonna force
them to make a public admission?

847
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,305
Damn right, I am.

848
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,574
- Who are you, mahatma gandhi?
- Somebody has to be.

849
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,543
You were too busy
demanding a bunch of zeros.

850
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,145
Well, I was just
looking out for you.

851
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,646
Those suits don't pay
for themselves.

852
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,714
No, they don't.

853
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:54,284
Mike, great job.
You really stepped it up.

854
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,852
Thanks, harvey.

855
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,889
I think you might be starting
to come into your own too.

856
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,398
(louis) really?

857
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,900
Every single game?

858
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,435
No, just the playoffs.

859
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,171
- Two sips?
- Two sips.

860
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,573
- No more, no less.
- Any beer?

861
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,308
Oh, no, not any beer.

862
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,809
Miller lite.

863
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,446
Miller lite?
What?

864
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,481
But she's a queen.

865
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,583
What can I tell you?
She got it from her dad.

866
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,518
Look, if the giants
are in the playoffs

867
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,353
And jessica doesn't take
two sips of miller lite

868
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,454
After every single first down,

869
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,589
She thinks they're gonna lose,

870
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:33,823
And there's no talking her
out of it.

871
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,660
And those happen a lot, right?
First downs?

872
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:37,794
They sure do.

873
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,430
So what is she like
when she's drunk?

874
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,465
Well, that's a conversation
for another time.

875
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,501
Ooh.

876
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:45,802
I so feel you, bro.

877
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,310
You know, I got to say, louis,

878
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,246
I almost feel bad
about pulling that prank on you.

879
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,982
Don't feel bad.

880
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,817
It was a pretty good prank.

881
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:05,255
Okay.
One more?

882
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,724
Only if you tell me more about
what jessica's like at home.

883
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:12,329
What she was like back
when it was pearson hardman.

884
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,831
- Done.
- [laughs]

885
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

886
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,967
You're heading out
for the night?

887
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,635
- In a few minutes.
- Want to grab a drink?

888
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,736
Celebrate?

889
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,338
- I can't.
- Why not?

890
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,839
Not that it's
any of your concern,

891
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,908
But I'm having drinks
with evan smith.

892
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,810
What?
You got her number?

893
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,311
No, she called me.

894
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,579
Oh, she asked for your number?

895
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,982
No, she didn't have to.
You gave it to her.

896
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,383
It was on that subpoena.

897
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,252
I know what's gonna
be on your subpoena.

898
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,487
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

899
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,356
Sure as hell do.

900
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,559
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

901
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,594
I take it you heard
about liberty rail.

902
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,762
- I did.
- See?

903
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,266
No harm, no foul,
no mass exodus of clients.

904
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,934
I'm glad.

905
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,435
What's on your mind, jessica?
You don't seem...

906
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,904
I know you told scottie
about mike ross.

907
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,980
How'd you know?

908
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,650
I didn't till just now.

909
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,518
- Jessica...
- I'm not mad.

910
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,054
I just want to know
what made you want to tell her.

911
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,622
What difference does that make?

912
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,858
Because I want to tell jeff
the truth about mike ross too.

913
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,593
What changed between now

914
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,662
And when you fed him
that louis bullshit?

915
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,497
Nothing's changed.

916
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,767
I just don't want
to lie to him anymore.

917
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,902
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

918
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,006
When the hell did you start
figuring shit like that out?

919
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,877
I didn't till just now.

920
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,045
Then answer my question.

921
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,013
What made you decide
to tell scottie?

922
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,317
That's not what
you really want to know.

923
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,887
What you want to know
is if I wish I told her sooner.

924
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,755
Do you?

925

Hey.

00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,742
Hey, rachel,
what can I do for you?

928
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:09,579
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

929
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,382
- For what?
- Oh, come on, donna.

930
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,452
Mike told me you saved the day.

Oh, well, you know,

932

After I saved those kids
from that burning building,

933
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,623
I had a little extra time, so...

934
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,492
Well, then maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

935
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:23,660
And why is that?

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,939
Good, because there are things
I can do without him,

946
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,808
Exceptionally.

947
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,479
I want to show you
a little video.

948
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,615
What, did you dig up footage

949
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:19,849
From my high school
championship?

950
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,885
Because that'll make this
too easy.

951
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,789
Afraid not.

952
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,125
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

953
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:33,163
Which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

954
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,907
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

955
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,009
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

958
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,774
Jeff, there's something
I need to tell you.

959
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,809
There's something
I need to tell you too.

960
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,847
What's going on?

961
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:26,049
What's going on is
I just had drinks with louis,

962
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,884
You know, as a favor to you.

963
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:31,554
Turns out he's not so great
at holding his liquor.

964
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,257
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

965
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,726
- You did.
- I don't...

966
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:37,894
You see, we were
actually bonding

967
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,762
When I suddenly remembered
what he had done to you,

968
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,031
And I...
Well, I wanted to make sure

969
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,167
That no one
ever did that to you again.

970
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,768
So I asked him how he found out

971
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,604
About daniel hardman's
embezzlement,

972
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,038
And he started with the words,

973
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,508
"it was two years ago."

974
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,775
Jeff, I can explain.

975
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,010
You can always explain,

976
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,179
But that just means
your whole story

977
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,182
About how louis got his name
on the door is bullshit.

978
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,917
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

979
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,619
More bullshit!

980
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,020
Then let me tell you now.

981
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,288
Don't you get it?
We're past that now.

982
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,923
- I don't want to know!
- Jeff...

983
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,958
In fact, I never really
wanted to know, I just...

984
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I just wanted you to tell me.

985
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,829
But now, no matter
what you tell me,

986
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:15,231
I won't ever believe
it's the truth.

987
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,699
Jeff, let me in.

988
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,867
It's over, jessica.

989
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,903
It's done.

990
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,677
We're done.
