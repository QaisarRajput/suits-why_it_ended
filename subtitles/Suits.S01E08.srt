1
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,410
Lucille.

2
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:16,580
Hey!

3
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:17,944
Hey, it's looking good.

4
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:19,946
- Tell me you got good news.
- I do.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,211
Stable shelters' bridge loan
has just been approved.

6
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:23,880
Harvey pulled
some strings at the bank.

7
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,986
Ah, good to see you, Harvey.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,792
I figured you was allergic
to manual labor.

9
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,597
Oh, I'll get my hands dirty
if I have to, Lucille.

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,905
But I believe
charity begins at home.

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,806
Yeah, and based on
that rolex you wear,

12
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:36,913
I'd say that your favorite cause
is doing pretty good.

13
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:39,149
We're gonna need
your signature here.

14
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,685
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
15% interest?

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,054
They're worried about
stable shelter's solvency.

16
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:45,221
They're worried?

17
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:46,923
They should try being
executive director.

18
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:48,090
If you don't recover the money

19
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,258
that Anthony Mazlo
embezzled from us,

20
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,094
every one of these
projects goes dark.

21
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,829
Unless you got
a spare room or two

22
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:55,797
for a couple thousand families
in your condo.

23
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,632
I'm not really
a roommate kind of guy.

24
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,732
Oh.

25
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,367
Harvey's deposing
Elliot Perkins,

26
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,302
Mazlo's number two,
this afternoon.

27
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,936
Perkins had to have
knowledge of this,

28
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,371
and he's going
to give up his boss.

29
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:07,075
That's a promise. Excuse me.

30
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,659
Check it out.
Mazlo spent $500 a night

31
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,498
on doggie daycare
on his trip to Greece.

32
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:23,867
Greece.

33
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:24,868
What?

34
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:27,940
- Oh, nothing.
- Tell me.

35
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:31,846
My first time was in Greece.

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,715
My God, you're picturing that
right now, aren't you?

37
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,019
I have no choice.
I'm a visual person.

38
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,227
You two are really adorable.

39
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,396
We're 48 hours from trial,
and you're gossiping

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,832
like two 12-year-olds
at sleepaway camp.

41
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,607
Listen up.

42
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:56,311
Lucille Jackson's not just the
head of stable shelters, okay?

43
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,381
She also sits
on the board of directors

44
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,916
of several of
our largest clients.

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,951
So if we lose this case,

46
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,354
I doubt that her generosity's
going to extend to us.

47
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,922
- I would...
- In my office.

48
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,624
Bring the clarity-drilling IPO.

49
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:11,027
Jerome Jensen's here. Come on.

50
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:13,029
Lucille's case
is all hands on deck, Harvey.

51
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,197
- You can't just...
- I can, and I am.

52
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:16,799
I thought we're
working on this together.

53
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,033
Yeah, we are, Louis.

54
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:20,336
Same way a golfer
and his caddy work together.

55
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,804
Be that as it may,

56
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:25,307
we are deposing Elliot Perkins
in 15 minutes, so...

57
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:26,309
Perkins can wait.

58
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,710
Just make sure that my 9 iron

59
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,245
is nice and shiny
when I get there.

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,448
Okay? Come on, Mike.

61
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:36,955
Harvey.

62
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,091
Jerome Jensen, meet Mike Ross.

63
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,259
He's got the latest on the IPO.

64
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,593
- Hello, Mike.
- Mr. Jensen.

65
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,063
I'm not here to talk
about my business, Harvey.

66
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,266
Looks like my daughter might be
getting into some trouble.

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,368
Mildred Wisnewski.

68
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,570
What's Lola doing
with a fake I.D.?

69
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,773
Well, that's what I hope
you can find out.

70
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,241
It slipped out of her purse

71
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,409
when she was ordering a drink
at a friend's Bar Mitzvah.

72
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,146
Any idea what it's about?

73
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,517
My relationship with Lola's
been rocky for a few years.

74
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,754
If I asked her, she'd just lie.

75
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,056
Truth is, I don't need to know.

76
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,126
I just need you
to take care of it.

77
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:16,030
Thank you.

78
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:17,698
What the hell is Harvey doing?

79
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,500
He's supposed to be
deposing Elliot Perkins.

80
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,601
He's with a client.

81
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,604
I don't care.
We have a deposition.

82
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:27,375
Don't even try it, Louis.

83
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,709
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:30,478
Let's... Let's just start over.
Okay?

85
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,814
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

86
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,083
You know I like you, right?

87
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,685
But in the firm's food chain,

88
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,854
I am a humpback whale,
and you are phytoplankton.

89
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,194
June 3, 1997.

90
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,602
That date means nothing to me.

91
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:56,539
Doesn't it?

92
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,573
Who told you?

93
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,375
Is the important thing
how I know

94
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,310
<i>or that I know?</i>

95
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,645
Does Harvey know?

96
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,980
He can.

97
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:05,281
I'm going to pay you.

98
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,217
I just don't have
cash on me right now.

99
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,986
So I'm gonna just tell Norma

100
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,354
to run her old ass
out to the atm

101
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,289
and then bring it back
in a jiff, all right?

102
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,424
I don't want your money, Louis.

103
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,425
I just want you to...

104
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,561
I was not here. I was not here.

105
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:20,099
I was not here.

106
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,534
All right,
let's get started, shall we?

107
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,936
Isn't Harvey Specter
leading this deposition?

108
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,338
He sent me.

109
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:28,607
Now, Mr. Perkins,

110
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:31,543
my first question to you is...

111
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:34,881
Do you sleep well at night?

112
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,449
Of course you do,

113
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,486
'cause you have a roof
and a bed and running water,

114
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,455
and by contrast,
thousands of families

115
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,889
are gonna be sleeping
on the street

116
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,292
when stable shelters is forced
to suspend their operations,

117
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,928
all because of the money
that you stole.

118
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:49,230
I never stole anything.

119
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:50,331
You're Mazlo's number two.

120
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,266
Money was embezzled.
Do you deny that?

121
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,801
- Absolutely.
- Please, Robert,

122
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,136
I know as general counsel
you just basically push paper,

123
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,706
but please warn Mr. Perkins
about the penalties of perjury.

124
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,808
Look, I'm not aware
of any perjury.

125
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,376
We know about your account
in the Caymans.

126
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,111
$20 million.
Are you kidding me?

127
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:06,146
That transaction
was legitimate.

128
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,382
Oh, when I take this public,
you're gonna be disgraced.

129
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:12,052
Your wife, your children,
your whole family, disgraced.

130
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,654
Would you show my client
some respect...

131
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,223
And that transaction
had nothing to do with the firm.

132
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:17,291
Bullshit.

133
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:18,792
You either
took your cut from Mazlo,

134
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,093
or it was hush money.

135
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,260
Either way, you're gonna live

136
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,562
the rest of your life
as a pariah,

137
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,930
or you give up Mazlo now.

138
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,531
Is this a deposition
or an inquisition?

139
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,733
This is ridiculous.
I can show you the records.

140
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,735
Oh, sure you can.
Because you're the guy

141
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,670
who invented losses
in mortgage-backed securities

142
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,406
when you never even
bought them.

143
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,207
I had no part in that.

144
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,477
But you were aware of it,
and you did nothing about it.

145
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,211
Come on, Louis.

146
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,613
Can I get
a glass of water, please?

147
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,616
You can't get any water.
We don't have any.

148
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,851
You give up Mazlo now,
and this all stops.

149
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,186
All right, that's... That's it.

150
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,187
My client needs a break.

151
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,955
We can continue this
in ten minutes.

152
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:54,092
I'm just getting started.

153
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,827
I don't get it.
She looks so sweet.

154
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,495
Don't let the photo fool you.

155
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,696
She's less "girl next door"

156
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,431
and more
"girl with the dragon tattoo."

157
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:01,665
Mm.

158
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,734
Look, my plate's full
with stable shelters.

159
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,669
I need you to look
into Jerome's daughter.

160
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:07,938
Why didn't you just
hire a private investigator?

161
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,140
Because if there's a problem,

162
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:10,942
an investigator can't fix it.

163
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,178
I'm not just a lawyer
to Jerome, okay?

164
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:17,283
<i>I'm... I'm more like
Robert Duvall in the godfather.</i>

165
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:19,252
His consigliere.

166
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,454
Okay.

167
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,522
What?

168
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,058
Uh, nothing.

169
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,293
Just if you're
his Robert Duvall,

170
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,527
you're coming to me,

171
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,796
so technically
I'm your Robert Duvall.

172
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,566
You're my Fredo.

173
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,869
Fredo? No.

174
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,475
Robert, what the hell
happened to Perkins?

175
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,347
Ask that pit bull of yours.

176
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,782
Uh, oh, no, actually.

177
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,451
I prefer a female masseuse?

178
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,153
If that...
Can I call you right back?

179
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,788
Right back. Okay, bye.

180
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:57,492
Perkins just got
wheeled out on stretcher.

181
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:58,927
Well, he couldn't
handle the heat.

182
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,928
He's probably faking it.

183
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:00,929
What were you thinking,

184
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,432
starting that deposition
without me?

185
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,267
I don't know. Maybe if
you were doing your jo...

186
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,102
- Oh, no.
- What?

187
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,671
It's from Geller.
Perkins wasn't faking anything.

188
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:13,241
Our best chance
to nail Anthony Mazlo's dead.

Well, he blew f the deposition,

198
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,790
so I was just
picking up the slack.

199
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:53,793
I was letting Perkins sweat.

200
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:56,162
It was a tactic,
which you completely undermined.

201
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,898
Well, I believe
I made him sweat and then some.

202
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,466
Are you actually proud
of what you did?

203
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,734
As far as I'm concerned,

204
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,035
whatever happened to that guy

205
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,604
was a result of his own guilt,

206
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:05,939
and I will not apologize

207
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,875
for deposing a criminal
in a vigorous manner.

208
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,710
Losing Perkins
is a complication.

209
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:13,546
We're just gonna
have to work harder

210
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,113
to unearth Mazlo's money trail.

211
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,615
As for what happened,

212
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,116
I've spoken to the hospital,

213
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,953
and cause of death
was a pulmonary embolism.

214
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,087
It was nothing you did.

215
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,956
Would it be okay
if I took the credit?

216
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,658
Louis, I need
to have a word with Harvey.

217
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:29,027
Okay.

218
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,737
Financial crime
is that man's forte.

219
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,605
Yes, he overstepped his rank,

220
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,974
but I'm not about to throw
the baby out with the bathwater.

221
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,341
Louis is the bathwater.

222
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:45,643
Believe it or not, Harvey,

223
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:47,679
you can be a real pain
in the ass to work with too.

224
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,147
Oh, I get along
with me just fine.

225
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:51,550
Yes, well, I'm not about
to tell Lucille Jackson

226
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:54,320
that we didn't win because
we couldn't work together.

227
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:56,622
You need to figure out
how to collaborate with Louis.

228
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,801
So the name
on Lola Jensen's fake I.D.

229
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,335
Wasn't just pulled
from thin air.

230
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,803
Belongs to an
assistant controller

231
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:13,071
at clarity drilling.

232
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:14,539
You're telling me this why?

233
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,574
You wanted me to look into it.

234
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,743
I didn't ask you
to explain the problem to me.

235
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,178
I asked you to fix it for me.

236
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:22,614
Hey, did Louis
really kill a guy?

237
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,616
Is that what the associate
rumor mill's been churning out?

238
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,185
Actually,
I think he started it.

239
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,487
"Yeah, he also claims
that he's 6'2"

240
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:32,090
with a full head of hair.

241
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,128
Louis with hair. That's good.

242
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:40,366
How'd you get past Donna?

243
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,368
You waited till she peed,
didn't you?

244
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:45,571
I mean, the woman
retains water like a camel.

245
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,974
I see that the, uh,
greatest band of all time

246
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,509
is conspicuously absent.

247
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,644
And who would that be, Louis?

248
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:53,712
Oh, I don't know.

249
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:54,713
A little British band
called queen?

250
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:55,881
Should have seen that coming.

251
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,149
You know, real musicians,

252
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,684
they don't wear eyeliner.

253
00:09:58,718 --> 00:10:00,119
Oh, really?
Why don't you tell that

254
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:01,554
to the artist
formerly known as Prince,

255
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,389
who's...
Once again named Prince?

256
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,724
What do you want, Louis?

257
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,625
Well, I think
now that we're working together,

258
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,760
we should set
some ground rules.

259
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:11,329
First rule,
never touch my records.

260
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:13,198
Or anything else
in this office.

261
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:16,200
Fine.

262
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:19,036
That includes the furniture.

263
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:22,473
I'm trying to build
a rapport with you.

264
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:23,741
Okay?

265
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:26,344
I mean, I think our relationship
needs a little work.

266
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,913
Let's hold off
the couples counseling

267
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,281
until our fifth anniversary.

268
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:31,216
Don't you think?

269
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,986
Look, Mazlo's lawyer
moved to push up the trial.

270
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:37,489
They know we need time
to cultivate another witness.

271
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:38,857
Well, I say we bluff.

272
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,560
I mean,
Perkins implicated Mazlo

273
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,194
the minute his lawyer
walked out of the room.

274
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,496
That's hearsay, Louis.

275
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,764
Not if it's
a deathbed confession.

276
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:48,733
Maybe while Geller
was making the 911 call,

277
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:52,003
I had a little
conversation with Perkins.

278
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,872
So you want to lie
about what Perkins said

279
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,207
and how he said it?

280
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:56,809
Well, what's your brilliant
solution, Harvey?

281
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,410
I'm having the money
in Perkins' account

282
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,513
traced as we speak, and I have
another witness in mind.

283
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:01,981
I get Anthony Mazlo
across that table,

284
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,249
you know I'll break him.

285
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:04,884
- The way you broke Perkins?
- Yeah, if need be.

286
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:05,885
You're not hearing me.

287
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,520
We need to hold off
on any meeting.

288
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:08,521
I don't...

289
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,389
That's final, Louis.

290
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:25,504
Question. Why would someone
named Lola Jensen

291
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:28,808
ever want to be known
as Mildred Wisnewski?

292
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,242
Who are you?

293
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,478
My name's Mike Ross.
I'm a lawyer.

294
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:34,714
Let me guess. Pearson Hardman?

295
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,453
You know, forging a government
document like this

296
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:43,256
after 911
is next to impossible.

297
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,826
God, there must have been
a glitch at the DMV.

298
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,394
Why'd you come here?

299
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,662
Your father came to us
'cause he's worried about you.

300
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:52,264
He's not worried.
He'd be here himself.

301
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,166
He wouldn't have sent
an empty suit.

302
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,771
You don't know anything
about me.

303
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:01,406
I, on the other hand,

304
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,907
know that you used this I.D.

305
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,075
To funnel payments
from clarity drilling

306
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,944
to some fake company
that you set up.

307
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,579
Locksley LLC?

308
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,614
You're stealing money
from your father's company.

309
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,252
Couple million so far.

310
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:15,320
I don't need to know why,

311
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:16,855
but I do need you
to return it. Now.

312
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,358
Actually,
you do need to know why.

313
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:21,127
This is ground water

314
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,364
from clarity's fracking
operation South of Tulsa.

315
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,800
It's got elevated levels
of dibutoxyethanol,

316
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:29,503
methane, and benzene.

317
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:32,638
This compares samples
taken pre-drilling

318
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,273
to levels taken last week.

319
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,976
How did you get that?
That's classified company data.

320
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,778
Let's just say
I'm good with computers.

321
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,547
Wait a minute. Locksley LLC.

322
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,316
As in Robin of Locksley,
as in Robin hood.

323
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,351
These toxins are known
to cause kidney failure,

324
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,253
liver cancer, and infertility.

325
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,354
The epa fines
were a slap on the wrist,

326
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,256
but the settlement
that your firm

327
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,557
negotiated with the victims...

328
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:55,493
It doesn't matter
how pure your motives are.

329
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,595
You're committing
a very serious crime.

330
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,264
Threaten all you want. Okay?

331
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:02,067
There's no way that my father's
gonna let this go public

332
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,502
right before his IPO.

333
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:06,372
I'm not giving the money back.

334
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,508
I'm giving it away.

335
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,113
In terms of living relatives,
I didn't find anything,

336
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:15,548
but when I looked into
the estates

337
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,750
of relatives who passed away,

338
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:20,319
e holding was originally
in the name of the aunt.

339
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:22,121
Your theory on Perkins
is right.

340
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,856
Harvey, what are you doing?

341
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,058
Rachel's services
are under my purview.

342
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:27,793
Sorry. I'm gonna change that.

343
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:31,095
Anthony Mazlo and his attorney
are in the conference room.

344
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,564
At whose invitation?

345
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:35,434
Oh, what,
you think I called 'em?

346
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:36,535
I... I didn't.

347
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,804
Then Mazlo feels
he has an advantage.

348
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:42,408
And he's pressing it.

349
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,743
Hey, fellas.

350
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,779
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

351
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,115
I figured you'd be on a flight
right now, Mr. Mazlo.

352
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,017
Somewhere with no
extradition agreement.

353
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,419
Let's get to the point.

354
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,454
Without Perkins,
you don't have a case.

355
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:54,688
This report summarizes

356
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,856
an internal investigation
we conducted.

357
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,124
What Inez has just handed you

358
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,293
is hard evidence
of fraudulent investments

359
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,728
and fake losses
perpetrated by Perkins.

360
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:03,863
Guys have a real penchant
for fiction, don't you?

361
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,231
No, he duped all of us.

362
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,435
As ceo, he betrayed me
just as much as the investors.

363
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,436
We found an offshore account
worth 20 million.

364
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:11,437
Hold on a second.

365
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:12,504
Lucille Jackson trusts you

366
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,139
to manage
a $150 million endowment.

367
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:15,308
Perkins takes 20.

368
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,843
Where the hell's
the rest of it?

369
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:17,944
In light of these findings,

370
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,779
we'd like to offer
a settlement.

371
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:21,747
15 million.

372
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,148
Ten cents on the dollar?

373
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:24,149
That's a slap in the face.

374
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,850
Well, we advise all our clients

375
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,351
that investments carry risk.

376
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,820
You want a risk-free return,
buy treasury bills,

377
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,555
or, I don't know,
hide your money

378
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,824
under the mattress.

379
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:36,260
While you were writing
the great American novel,

380
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,162
I've been checking facts.

381
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:40,765
The 20 million
that Perkins had overseas

382
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,233
was legitimate.

383
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:45,203
He was innocent.

384
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,639
The money your firm embezzled
is still out there,

385
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:48,973
and this so-called
investigation

386
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:51,676
isn't worth the paper
it's printed on.

387
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,812
Well, Lucille Jackson
may beg to differ, counselor.

388
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,148
A bridge loan
means she's desperate.

389
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:59,183
Our offer is non-negotiable.

390
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:02,320
I won't accept this offer
today or a year from now.

391
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,522
Now since you've all
invited yourselves over,

392
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:06,157
feel free to see
yourselves out.

393
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,701
So first you attack me for
wanting to lie about Perkins,

394
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,670
and then you turn around,
do the same exact thing?

395
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,371
I wasn't lying.

396
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,674
What are you saying to me?

397
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,242
Harvey, what the hell
are you saying to me?

398
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,044
That Perkins had no
involvement whatsoever?

399
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:27,645
That's exactly
what I'm saying, Louis.

400
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,714
He was innocent.

401
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,841
It's no surprise
that Mazlo low-balled us.

402
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:43,379
I'm just passing along
this offer as a formality.

403
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:46,716
$15 million
is not insignificant.

404
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,151
But now's not the time
to settle.

405
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,853
We have to strengthen our hand.

406
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,955
All right, here's my problem.

407
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,189
Best-case scenario.

408
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,892
We go to trial,
the jury awards us a settlement,

409
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:57,693
obviously Mazlo appeals that.

410
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,528
It's three years
before I see any money,

411
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,297
and my foundation's
long gone by that point.

412
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,798
No, I'm not gonna let Mazlo

413
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,767
pocket the lion's share
of your endowment.

414
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:06,602
I'm not interested
in a pyrrhic victory.

415
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,371
Neither are we.

416
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:11,175
And to prove it, we're gonna
forego our usual fee,

417
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,544
and return to you the money
you've already paid.

418
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:18,917
I grew up
sleeping in my mama's car.

419
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:22,655
And in and out of more
halfway houses than I can count,

420
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:26,226
and one thing I realized
is that every penny matters.

421
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,562
So thank you.

422
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,264
What you gonna do?

423
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,099
Perkins may have been innocent,

424
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,734
but he was still
Mazlo's direct report.

425
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,302
I'm gonna find out
what he knew.

426
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:39,005
Your job is to verify
every detail

427
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,141
of Mazlo's
internal investigation.

428
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:44,078
It is not about the crime now.
It's about the cover-up.

429
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:45,279
This says Perkins acted alone.

430
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,614
Well, he's
the perfect scapegoat.

431
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:47,849
He can't defend himself.

432
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,083
You want to go to the bathroom?

433
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:51,586
You don't bother coming back.

434
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,357
By the way, that goes
for personal phone calls,

435
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:55,958
emails, and texts.

436
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,294
I detect a whiff of slacking,

437
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,899
you are done. Get it?

438
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,900
You find anything,
I'll be in my office.

439
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:10,573
Louis. Uh, I'm still
working on Harvey's case.

440
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,941
Jerome Jensen can go
screw himself for all I care.

441
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,342
Well, Harvey
explicitly told me...

442
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,144
I don't care if
a burning bush told you, Mike.

443
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,179
The only commandments
you need to focus on right now

444
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:21,415
come from me.

445
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,818
There's something wrong
with Louis.

446
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,720
It's not my problem.
I answer to Harvey.

447
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,056
Sitting home alone
with your kids, with no job.

448
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,157
Harvey.

449
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:30,626
You solve Jerome's problem yet?

450
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,728
Uh, about to. But I need
your corporate card first.

451
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:34,263
What for?

452
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,700
Well, I thought you didn't
want me to explain it to you.

453
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,769
You're right. I don't.

454
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,374
Okay.

455
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,844
It's killing you not knowing

456
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,278
what I'm gonna use this for,
isn't it?

457
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,647
Nope.

458
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,814
Please let me tell you.

459
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,249
If you bring that back to me

460
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,350
and it smells like stripper,

461
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:55,351
you're fired.

462
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,221
I don't... I don't go
to places like that.

463
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,258
You had to send someone?

464
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,229
Couldn't just call me?

465
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,731
If you wanted this
to be private,

466
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:11,032
should have just robbed me.

467
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,666
You robbed the company,
I had to involve other people.

468
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,968
Okay. Why don't we take a seat?

469
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,570
Why are you here?

470
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,305
I want to tell you
my side of things.

471
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,540
Okay.

472
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:21,608
I'm not proud of the fact

473
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,710
that we contaminated
people's water.

474
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:25,245
But we apologized.

475
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,415
We implemented safeguards.

476
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:30,318
We negotiated a payout
that was more than generous.

477
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:31,420
If that's what you think,

478
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:33,422
then you are lying to yourself.

479
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,090
I think that
we could keep this civil...

480
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,258
No, she's right. It's true.

481
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,793
I am lying to myself.

482
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,829
I thought this was a phase,

483
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,231
that it was hormones,
that it would pass,

484
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:44,333
but the truth is...

485
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,767
I raised a thief.

486
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,803
Okay, I think we're gonna
need a minute. Thank you.

487
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,138
A thief.

488
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,340
My research is making the planet
more habitable, okay?

489
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:54,443
You are making money
destroying it.

490
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:56,478
You have no respect for me,
that's fine.

491
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,714
But at least
respect the workers.

492
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,215
You're stealing from them too.

493
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,252
You think I'm such a criminal?
Arrest me.

494
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,521
So I organized this so that
you two could clear the air,

495
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:07,256
and it seems we've gotten
off the wrong foot...

496
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,259
You know what? It's the same
story as always, dad.

497
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:13,497
You duck your responsibilities.

498
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,566
Lo... Lola.

499
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,974
What if I paid the company
back with my own money?

500
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,276
I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

501
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,577
It would make you
a conspirator.

502
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,179
I'm not turning my daughter
into the police.

503
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:30,714
This is not about
the company image.

504
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:31,882
Well, the good news is,

505
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,316
she hasn't distributed
the money...

506
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:36,820
The money is irrelevant.

507
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:40,657
I came to Pearson Hardman
to take care of this.

508
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:43,927
Instead, my daughter and I
are further apart than ever.

509
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,635
I can't imagine
how hard it is right now.

510
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,273
People are saying the most
horrible things about Elliot.

511
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,942
They must think I've gone deaf.

512
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,846
Anthony Mazlo has been
dragging your husband's name

513
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,082
through the mud to make him
a scapegoat, Mrs. Perkins.

514
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,918
I'm here to help.

515
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:06,919
I don't understand.

516
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,119
You work for the other side.

517
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:10,054
I work for
a charitable organization

518
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,390
that had all its money stolen.

519
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:15,158
I'm on the other side of
Anthony Mazlo, not your husband,

520
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,459
and I don't want
to see his memory

521
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,461
painted with the same brush.

522
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:21,297
What would I have to do?

523
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:22,631
This isn't the time
or the place.

524
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,234
No, it's okay.
What would I have to do?

525
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,402
I'd like to know everything

526
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:28,971
Elliot has ever
told you about Mazlo.

527
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:32,541
Any details would help.

528
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:35,144
Miss Perkins,
uh, I'm Louis Litt,

529
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:36,345
and I just want to let you know

530
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:37,813
that I'm going to do
whatever it takes

531
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:40,182
to clear your husband's name.

532
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:41,784
His name?

533
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:45,054
My husband would be alive today

534
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,055
if it weren't for you.

535
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,290
Well, we don't know that.

536
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:49,392
I know what happened
in that room.

537
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:51,361
Well, at the time,
we didn't have all the facts,

538
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:55,230
but now we do.

539
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,767
I can't believe
that you have the audacity

540
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,668
to come here.

541
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:04,073
I don't ever want
to see your face again.

542
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:06,309
And you can forget
about me helping you.

543
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,583
What the hell are you doing?

544
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:14,952
I was deposing the widow,
just like you.

545
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:18,223
I came here to pay my respects
and initiate a relationship,

546
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,191
not aggravate a grieving woman.

547
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,526
Yeah, I brought flowers.

548
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,429
You just cost us
a potential witness.

549
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,697
Oh, really?

550
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:28,332
Well, maybe... Maybe if you shared
your game plan with me...

551
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,467
Oh, the same way that you
shared your game plan with me?

552
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,704
How do you expect her
to react to seeing you?

553
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:36,305
You need to get
your shit together

554
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,641
and find us a new witness.

555
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,524
Lola.

556
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,394
Wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

557
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:58,996
Can I come in?

558
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,299
Uh, yeah. Of course.

559
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,201
Nice gesture.
Botanical gardens.

560
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,603
Yeah, he said it was a pretty
special place for you guys.

561
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:09,873
It was. And then he became ceo.

562
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,442
But I'm not here to reminisce.

563
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,512
I must say I was, uh,
really impressed

564
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:17,847
you figured out
what I was doing.

565
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,883
Especially since you're
not even a real lawyer.

566
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,485
What... What are you
talking about?

567
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,755
I accessed Harvard
law school's alumni directory.

568
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:28,658
Every class that graduated
for the last ten years.

569
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:32,027
No record of Mike Ross. At all.

570
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,029
Yeah, the Dean's office
was supposed to fix that.

571
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,431
They... They put my name wrong
in the system.

572
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,266
I checked your
social security number

573
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,434
against the database.

574
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:41,303
How'd you get my social
security number?

575
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:44,339
Easily. Here's the deal.

576
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:47,643
Leave me alone,
or I expose you.

577
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,045
You don't really seem
that worried about this.

578
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,813
Threats like hers are a tactic.

579
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,049
They're effective
because they distract you

580
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,450
from what you're
supposed to be doing.

581
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,584
Are you crazy?

582
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,420
What we should be doing
is backing the hell off.

583
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:09,521
And how would that go, huh?

584
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,628
"Jerome, you came to
us with the problem,

585
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:12,790
"we discovered that
your daughter

586
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,458
"stole $2 million
from your company,

587
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,527
and our conclusion is
you're shit out of luck"?

588
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,362
I don't really care
how it would go.

589
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,663
All I care about is my life,

590
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,265
and... And keeping our secret.

591
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,601
I told you, it's a distraction.

592
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,737
She won't pull that trigger.

593
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,873
Why do you think she hasn't
distributed that money yet?

594
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,442
Why do you think Jerome doesn't
want us to go to the police?

595
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,776
I don't know.

596
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,979
It's because they both
want to bury the hatchet,

597
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,648
and if any of that stuff
happens, they can't.

598
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:38,150
Then what?

599
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,252
Figure out a way
to make them reconcile.

600
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,788
It's easy.

601
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:45,156
Yeah. It's easy.

602
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,291
Inez, right? Louis Litt.

603
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,292
I know who you are.

604
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,394
So is this what you do
for Mazlo?

605
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,495
You clean up his dirty laundry?

606
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,763
Leave me alone.

607
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,531
You know, you have
your whole career ahead of you.

608
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,666
Mazlo goes down and you're
part of this cover-up,

609
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,667
no one's gonna hire you.

610
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,902
I can't help you.

611
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,703
Listen, can I just
tell you something, Inez?

612
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,805
In my experience, people respond
to two things, okay?

613
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,907
And that's the carrot
and the stick.

614
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,042
Now, I prefer the stick,

615
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,477
and if you do not help me,

616
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,912
I will devote
my considerable expertise

617
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,714
to sticking it to you.

618
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,850
The same way
you stuck it to Perkins.

619
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,990
Inez, stop.

620
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:24,560
Let's go with the carrot.

621
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,265
Inez, Harvey Specter.

622
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,634
I appreciate you
coming forward.

623
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:35,836
I should have done it sooner.

624
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,204
What changed?

625
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:40,907
I can't be a part
of a company like that anymore.

626
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:43,310
Are you ready to testify
against Anthony Mazlo

627
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,079
in open court?

628
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:46,948
I am.

629
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,883
I assume you've documented
his malfeasance.

630
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,453
Because otherwise it's
he said, she said.

631
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:56,559
The entire paper trail.

632
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,628
From the beginning
all the way to last week.

633
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:04,600
Harvey asked me to fix
this problem with Lola,

634
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,569
but I can't.

635
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:11,339
Because your daughter's
not the problem, Mr. Jensen.

636
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:15,375
You are.

637
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,877
Are you trying to get fired?

638
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,146
No. I'm not.

639
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,114
I'm your attorney.

640
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:22,849
It's my job to give you advice.

641
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:25,453
But you're her father.

642
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,088
It's your job to raise her.

643
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:28,423
Now, you can go
to another firm,

644
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,292
but there's not a lawyer
in the city

645
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,493
that can do that job for you.

646
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:34,396
Please don't lecture me
on parenting.

647
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,499
Mr. Jensen, I had a difficult
relationship with my father,

648
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,168
so trust me when I tell you

649
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:40,803
that Lola wants to forgive you,

650
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:42,939
but she needs you
to take the first step.

651
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:44,340
Well, we tried it your way.

652
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,245
We went to lunch, and you saw
how well that worked out.

653
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,681
My daughter's not a child.

654
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,116
She's an adult.

655
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,286
She made these choices
as an adult.

656
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,587
If you just found a way...

657
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,857
You're my lawyer.
This is a legal problem.

658
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,330
My daughter
brought this on herself.

659
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,466
Now, I desperately do not want
her to go to prison.

660
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:11,203
But if she doesn't
return the money, she will.

661
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,774
Where's Mazlo?

662
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,544
He was afraid
to face us himself?

663
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,678
What do you want?

664
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,581
We know about
your entire scheme.

665
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,849
What scheme?

666
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,751
Oh, the scheme where
Mazlo's laundering money

667
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,220
through Dubai.

668
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,322
How do you know about Dubai?

669
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,624
We cultivated another source.

670
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,026
What kind of settlement
are you looking for?

671
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:39,464
One that includes
punitive damages.

672
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,899
Send Inez in here, please.

673
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,101
I don't think
you'll find her at her desk.

674
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,268
Why not?

675
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:48,306
'Cause she agreed
to testify for us.

676
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,009
I doubt that.

677
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,915
When your colleague
approached her,

678
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,050
she came straight to us.

679
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,585
He even tried to bribe me.

680
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,621
He said if
I ratted out Mr. Mazlo,

681
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:04,658
he'd get me a job as an
assistant to Jessica Pearson.

682
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,194
Everything she told you
is a complete fabrication.

683
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,596
There is no Dubai.

684
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,065
I seem to recall
you mentioning something

685
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,168
about penalties for perjury

686
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:15,702
at our last meeting.

687
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:20,174
Well, the penalty for bribing
a witness is just as severe.

688
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,110
And we're willing to overlook
that indiscretion

689
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,178
if you convince your client

690
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,313
to take our settlement offer.

691
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:29,683
Well, our revised
settlement offer.

692
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,619
- Revised?
- Yes.

693
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:35,356
Exactly half
of what it was before.

694
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,079
What the hell
were you thinking?

695
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,280
We needed a new witness.

696
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:47,881
You didn't think
to look into her story?

697
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,283
I don't know.
Did you look into it?

698
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,684
You were the one
who brought her in.

699
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,685
I assumed you had.

700
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,187
Like any halfway
decent lawyer would.

701
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,355
We were under the gun.

702
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:55,990
And I was under
strict instructions

703
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,525
from my golf pro
to get another witness.

704
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,460
<i>No, I told you to get
another witness,</i>

705
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,461
not bribe one.

706
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:01,696
That's enough.

707
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,964
As for the threat
against Louis,

708
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,166
no money changed hands.

709
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,467
I'm not concerned with Louis.

710
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,302
He brought your name
into it, okay?

711
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:08,937
The offer was to be
your assistant.

712
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,640
Now you're exposed
because of what he did.

713
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:12,641
Is that true?

714
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,842
She's an executive assistant

715
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,410
to the head of
a major investment firm.

716
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,446
She's not gonna work
for a junior partner.

717
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,447
So you tried to bribe her.

718
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:19,847
No, it wasn't a bribe, Jessica.

719
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:21,649
It was an incentive.

720
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:23,117
I thought she'd be
more likely to talk

721
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:26,420
if she wasn't worried
about getting fired.

722
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,490
I want you to go to Mazlo
and take their offer.

723
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:30,892
- I'm not ready to do that.
- I'm not either.

724
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,594
I waived Lucille's fee

725
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,129
because a certain
senior partner

726
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:35,263
said we'd never go to trial.

727
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,065
I said that before
you stuck me with Louis.

728
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,266
Not the point.

729
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,801
She can't afford it,
and neither can we.

730
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,102
Give me time.

731
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,937
Give it to me without Louis,

732
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,872
and we'll see who can
afford it and who can't.

733
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,577
You have until
the end of the day.

734
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,078
You come up empty,

735
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,347
I'm taking the offer
to Lucille myself.

736
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:00,586
Jessica. I went to Perkins...

737
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,488
Not another word.

738
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,393
You try something
like that again,

739
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:10,563
and it will be your last day
at this firm.

740
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,109
You said Jerome
wouldn't pull the trigger.

741
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,677
You were wrong. He's ready.

742
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,111
I don't have time
for that right now.

743
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:27,313
Harvey, when the police
show up at Lola's doorstep,

744
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,914
we're done.

745
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,917
Has she distributed
the money yet?

746
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,085
No, she hasn't, but she's...

747
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,953
She hasn't, and she won't,

748
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,856
because what she wants
is her daddy's attention.

749
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,925
Now sit down with me,
and let's deal with this.

750
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,192
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

751
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:42,695
Why don't you tell me
what you need?

752
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:44,363
Mazlo was in Liechtenstein

753
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,965
the day that Lucille's
endowment evaporated.

754
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,099
Maybe he was skiing.

755
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:51,302
Nobody goes to
Liechtenstein for pleasure.

756
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:52,870
Why don't we subpoena
the bank records?

757
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:53,938
How many banks can there be?

758
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,407
Place is like
Switzerland on steroids.

759
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,708
We'll never see those records.

760
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:00,311
So what the hell
do you want from me, then?

761
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:05,283
What did you just say to me?

762
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,886
I once suggested
that we hack Harvard's records

763
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,890
to cover my ass,
and you laughed at me.

764
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:12,458
And now it turns out
that you were wrong,

765
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:14,493
and it's about
to cost me my career.

766
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,162
Where are you going?

767
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,764
You told me to fix my case.

768
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:20,500
Why don't you fix yours?

769
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,968
Hope you came here to tell me
Harvey's backing off.

770
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,271
I wish I could, but he's not.

771
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:00,873
That's too bad.
Had such a promising career.

772
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,074
Oh, my God. God, Lola,

773
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:03,743
you act like you care
about a higher cause,

774
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:05,177
but of all the companies
that exist,

775
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,545
you chose your dad.

776
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,581
Company that's trying
to make amends for what it did.

777
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:10,282
Really don't need
to hear another speech

778
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,950
from a wannabe suit.

779
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:14,319
God, you think
I'm your enemy, huh?

780
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:15,787
Well, I'm not.

781
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:16,788
I didn't even come here

782
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:19,590
to talk to you about me
or your father.

783
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:23,395
New York. Iowa. Kansas.

784
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,897
40 states that all
have housing projects

785
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,065
that will vanish if we don't
find out information

786
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,400
that only you can help us get.

787
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,302
So you can steal money
for your father's company

788
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:33,304
or you can blow the whistle
on me if you want to,

789
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:34,539
but if you
really care about people

790
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:35,540
the way that you claim to,

791
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,642
you're gonna do this first.

792
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,882
Are we close?

793
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,784
I'm accessing the banks
through a server in China.

794
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,986
Unless you'd rather
me use yours.

795
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:52,991
- Take your time.
- Done.

796
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:55,093
All right, there's 16 banks
in Liechtenstein.

797
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:57,462
This is every account
in every single one of them.

798
00:31:57,497 --> 00:32:00,399
None of the accounts
is listed under Anthony Mazlo.

799
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:01,400
Forget about the name.

800
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,168
Find an account
with $150 million

801
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:07,440
embezzled from stable shelters
on that day.

802
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:09,275
Harvey, it's time.

803
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,244
Unless you have something,

804
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,446
I'm calling Lucille to settle.

805
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,282
Jessica,
you know how Liechtenstein

806
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:16,684
doesn't respond to subpoenas,

807
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:17,952
so I've responded for them.

808
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,420
Just trust me.

809
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,956
We've got everything we need
to find Lucille's money.

810
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,925
It's not here.

811
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,761
Sounds like you need more
than just another minute.

812
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,463
You need another person.

813
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,698
Someone whose expertise
is financial crime.

814
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,399
No. No.

815
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,969
Harvey, bring in Louis.

816
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:39,138
Or I'm calling Lucille.

817
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,761
Donna, I need to talk to Louis.

818
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,163
He's not in his office.

819
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:55,331
Huh. Norma wouldn't
tell you where he is?

820
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:58,435
Well, she didn't, um...

821
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,870
You didn't ask her, did you?

822
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:02,038
She gives me the creeps.

823
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:03,807
Ugh. You're such a wuss.

824
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:04,941
What did you just say to me?

825
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:08,912
I think we both know
what I just said.

826
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,014
Norma, where is he?

827
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:12,882
What? You're kidding.

828
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,718
- What?
- Shh.

829
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,199
I come here
when I need to be alone.

830
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,469
.44 Magnum?

831
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,204
Really?

832
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:36,206
Feeling lucky today, punk?

833
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,008
You know, I understand

834
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,345
that me pissing the bed
on this case

835
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:43,048
must be really, really
fun for you.

836
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:46,284
No. Louis, it's not.

837
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,786
The one thing
you and I have in common

838
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:49,655
is we need to win.

839
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:52,025
I noticed that.

840
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,261
I came here because,
even after everything,

841
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:56,562
we can win.

842
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,797
No.

843
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:02,233
I can watch while you win.

844
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,603
Louis, I'm not here
to give you shit.

845
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,438
Listen, I respect you.

846
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:07,839
I bribed a witness.

847
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,308
You incentivized her.

848
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:10,876
Went to see Perkins' widow.

849
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,278
To apologize.

850
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,314
I killed a man.

851
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:16,517
That you thought had it coming.

852
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:19,720
I don't think
you heard what I said.

853
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:21,589
I respect you.

854
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,595
You need my help.

855
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,964
I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that.

856
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:32,066
Well, if you need my help,

857
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,668
you better phrase it
exactly like that.

858
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:34,835
Okay. You want me to say it?

859
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,037
I'll say it.

860
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,872
I'm under the gun,
and I need your help.

861
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:41,309
I've got information that you've
got the financial expertise

862
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:42,543
to break this case.

863
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,412
Now let's put the gun down
and go get 'em.

864
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,051
Okay.

865
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,585
First just stand over there.

866
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,688
Don't push it.

867
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:02,897
So what was the exact
amount of money

868
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:04,699
that was lost from
stable shelters' account?

869
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,700
Why?

870
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:10,038
$152,375,242.18.

871
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,409
I'm good with numbers.

872
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:17,111
Huh.

873
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:18,646
All right. What do you have?

874
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,849
We've compiled a printout
of every account

875
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,219
that had a deposit made
on the day in question

876
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:25,521
in all of Liechtenstein's
16 banks.

877
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:31,126
Okay. Well, we are going
to focus on, excuse me...

878
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,294
These five banks.

879
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:34,462
How can you be sure?

880
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:35,997
Watch this.

881
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,432
These four banks have a history

882
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,567
of capitulating to subpoenas.

883
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:40,935
So Mazlo would know.

884
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,738
These six
have U.S. corporate parents,

885
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:45,940
which would expose their
accounts to federal scrutiny.

886
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:48,076
Once again, Mazlo would know.

887
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,546
And then the one that he's got
right there is low in reserves,

888
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,548
therefore its solvency's
in question,

889
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:53,949
and there is no way in hell

890
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,551
that Mazlo would take
his stolen money

891
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:58,654
and put it into
some shaky bank.

892
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,091
So we can be sure.

893
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,426
Every person
who embezzles money,

894
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,660
they do it in their own way,

895
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,462
but the one thing
that they all have in common

896
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,931
is that they never put
all their eggs in one basket.

897
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,701
So we are going to be looking
at a combination of accounts.

898
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,802
Across banks.

899
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,137
Well, I mean,
maybe across banks.

900
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,604
Maybe the same bank.

901
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,006
But we're definitely looking
at more than one account.

902
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,273
How do we figure out
which accounts are his?

903
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,675
Because they're all
gonna add up

904
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,109
to the same exact
amount of money

905
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,577
that was lost from
stable shelters' account.

906
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,912
Well, how do you know?

907
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:24,647
When the account was drained,
it had to go somewhere.

908
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,516
What goes out from Lucille's
had to go into Mazlo's.

909
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:28,984
Simple law of mathematics.

910
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,920
So we just have to figure out
a combination of accounts

911
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,760
that adds up to...
$152,375,242.18.

912
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,663
I'm good with numbers too.

913
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,407
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

914
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,242
Well, I assume you're ready
to take our offer.

915
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:52,276
I rushed right down.

916
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,678
Well, we just have
a few questions

917
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:54,946
before we get to any of that.

918
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,614
We didn't agree to answer
any questions.

919
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,984
No, no, Robert, it's okay.
I'm happy to play.

920
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,820
Have you ever been
to Liechtenstein, Mr. Mazlo?

921
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:04,923
You know,
I've been to many places.

922
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:07,625
Among them, Liechtenstein.

923
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,827
Really?
Well, of those many places,

924
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,629
did you open seven
different bank accounts,

925
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,999
the amounts of which add up to
exactly the same amount of money

926
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:16,668
that disappeared from Lucille
Jackson's endowment fund?

927
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,871
I doubt it.
Uh, what I don't doubt

928
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,174
is that if you trace the money
that went into those accounts,

929
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,509
you'll find that it came

930
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,812
from our corporate offices
in Sri Lanka.

931
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,380
It's completely legitimate.

932
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:28,149
I mean, I'm happy
to show you the records, uh,

933
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:29,717
whenever you'd like.

934
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,053
That's great. Isn't that great?

935
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:34,521
Well, after that,
can you show us the records

936
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:36,023
of the seven
safety deposit boxes

937
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:38,025
that you opened at those
same banks the same day?

938
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,236
I don't have to answer that.

939
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,637
This isn't a deposition.

940
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:52,340
You're so right.
It's more of a presentation.

941
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:53,541
We could make it a deposition.

942
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,943
- Or trial.
- Up to you.

943
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,212
We have pictures of you
entering those banks.

944
00:37:57,246 --> 00:38:00,715
And we have enough
to crack their subpoenas.

945
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,551
Just a matter of time, Tony.

946
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:07,956
All right. What do you want?

947
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,858
What do I wa...?
Well, it's not about me.

948
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,927
It's about Lucille.
She wants your head on a stick

949
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,929
but she'll settle
for her money back.

950
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:18,199
And your resignation.

951
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:19,900
We agree right here,

952
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,503
no criminal prosecution?

953
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,908
Done.

954
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:32,347
If Lucille doesn't
get her money back today,

955
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,249
nothing's done.

956
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:45,127
Great. That's perfect.

957
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,461
You are back in business.

958
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:47,929
The wire transfer
just went through.

959
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:50,298
Girl, you came through.

960
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,133
That is what we do.

961
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,602
Harvey. Harvey, get in here.

962
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:57,038
Lucille wants
to thank you in person.

963
00:38:57,072 --> 00:38:59,340
Always got time for gratitude.

964
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,176
Harvey,
you didn't let me settle,

965
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,844
and I appreciate your tenacity.

966
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,479
Truth is,
I didn't do this on my own.

967
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:05,680
Have you met Louis Litt?

968
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,048
You guys are doing
such good work.

969
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,316
I just want you to know it.

970
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,652
Have I told you how valuable
you are to this company?

971
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,520
'Cause you're not.
I'm just kidding.

972
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:15,257
Janice, I want you to take
the rest of the day off

973
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,025
because you're so good.
And I really mean it.

974
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,694
Harold, 9:30. Tequila shots.

975
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,930
You and me. Sharp. Be there.

976
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,436
Thank you.

977
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:29,672
- All right.
- See you later.

978
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:37,380
Louis. Luiz.

979
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:38,448
What's up?

980
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:40,384
What were you
just doing in there?

981
00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:41,685
What? I was just...

982
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,420
Let me guess.
You were cutting me out.

983
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:45,622
- What are you talking about?
- The little impromptu meeting

984
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:46,956
you just had
with Jessica and Lucille

985
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,424
that you conveniently
left me out of.

986
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:49,726
I didn't leave you
out of anything.

987
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,027
I mean,
I thought we were a team.

988
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,395
I thought this was the start
of something, but I...

989
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,698
Now I see the truth
all too clearly.

990
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,734
Louis, I was walking by,
and they called me in.

991
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:00,636
Yeah, just in time to take
the credit for what I did.

992
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:03,172
I didn't do that.

993
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:05,207
Wouldn't even think
of doing that.

994
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:07,109
But you know what?

995
00:40:07,144 --> 00:40:10,179
You would, and that's
your problem right there.

996
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,401
Got your email about Mazlo.

997
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:33,337
Not a bad way
for Locksley LLC to go out.

998
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:35,372
Looks like the
firm owes you one.

999
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,541
<i>Think you owe me one.</i>

1000
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:48,452
Whoa.

1001
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,987
Is this... The real thing?

1002
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:51,555
Yeah.

1003
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,091
Told the Dean's office
you'd lost yours,

1004
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,559
and they were happy to oblige

1005
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:58,095
for one of their top graduates.

1006
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:01,431
I don't know if
you're awesome or terrifying.

1007
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:04,768
Also I added a layer
of protection for you.

1008
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:14,009
Uh, the Harvard law school
alumni database?

1009
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:19,413
It's all there.
Your name, class rank,

1010
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:21,449
social security number.

1011
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,385
You do realize you just
made me party to a crime, right?

1012
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:25,852
Can always call 'em up,

1013
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,387
report it as a glitch.

1014
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:30,624
Let me guess. Untraceable.

1015
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:32,559
I'm not saying
you won't get caught,

1016
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:35,830
but it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

1017
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,602
Hey, um...

1018
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:43,471
Thank you.

1019
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:45,273
Seriously.

1020
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:46,874
You're right.

1021
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,110
Working things out with my dad.

1022
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:50,778
Yeah.

1023
00:41:50,813 --> 00:41:53,180
Not the empty suit
I thought you were.

1024
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:02,455
Who was that?

1025
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,590
Uh, client's daughter.

1026
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,992
Really? It's kind of late.

1027
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,927
What's she doing
at the office at this hour?

1028
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:11,165
You know, she was, uh,
just thanking me.

1029
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,533
- Thanking you.
- Mm-hmm.

1030
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,635
How'd she do that?

1031
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,704
Easily.

1032
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,340
She bought me
two tickets to Greece.

1033
00:42:18,374 --> 00:42:21,457
- Not interested.
- We leave Tuesday.
