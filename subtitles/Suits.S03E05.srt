Well, he couldn't.

If we can't confront them,

then their statements
are inadmissible.

doesn't mean
they don't exist.

that I made some copies

to get dismissed.

Then why would I ask for it?

138
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:43,642

to grant an expedited trial

What if they didn't just have
to scramble for new evidence?

What if they had to scramble
for a whole new lawyer?

Any lawyer who got
assigned this case

146
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,577
with only two weeks to go
would drop the whole thing.

00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,112
Unless they had
a personal beef with you,

148
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,646
which they wouldn't.
There's only one way

149
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:06,248
to get Cameron
thrown off this case.

150

with Gianopolous.

to "I don't want to talk
about this anymore" lane.

about how to prove they colluded

00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:11,756
Memos from a distant land
don't shape shit into shit.

316
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,207
Nonsense.

317
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,910
I attended boarding school
from the tender age of four,

318
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,578
during which time
I received weekly memos

319
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:18,913
from my father.

320
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,348
Yeah, and look
how you turned out.

321
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:22,416
Graduating summa cum laude
from both Cambridge

322
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,435
and Harvard
is quite the failure.

323
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,939
Your parents' choice
to "homeschool," much better.

324
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,256
Okay, that was only
till I was ten,

325
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,091
and my mother's science fair
was legendary.

326
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:34,278
You must be so proud of
your uncontested blue ribbons.

327
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,781
Okay, you know what,

328
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,699
I'm not gonna let you
shatter the glass

329
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,234
that I spent years blowing.

330
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:41,986
And I'm certainly not gonna
let the likes of you

331
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,438
tell me who I can
and cannot blow.

332
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,493
[Shoes clacking]

333
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,777
He's not gonna come.

334
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:50,778
He will.

335
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,463
You pushed his assistant?

336
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,548
I charmed her.

337
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,049
You didn't.

338
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,585
He's right,
you didn't.

339
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:00,505
She was irritated.

340
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,122
But I was curious.

341
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,474
Works for me.

342
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,594
You know what they say
about curiosity.

343
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,015
I get it.

344
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,018
I come after Hessington Oil,
you come after me.

345
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:15,686
Well, bring it on, boys.

346
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:16,854
I got a team of lawyers

347
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,523
just itching
to take your lunch money.

348
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,888
Well, unfortunately, you're
not gonna be able to use them.

349
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,309
He's not gonna
sue you here.

350
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,245
He's gonna sue you
in London,

351
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,030
where you have
countless holdings.

352
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:28,332
Where the burden of proof
isn't on the plaintiff.

353
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,867
It's on the defendant.

354
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,836
So instead of us
having to prove you're guilty,

355
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,704
you'll have to prove
you're innocent.

356
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,256
Doesn't look
very innocent.

357
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:36,490
So you guys think
I'm gonna run scared

358
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,510
at the prospect of losing
a little money.

359
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:42,713
I'm a corporate raider.

360
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:46,968
This is a $50,000 bond.

361
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,105
You see, I'm not in
this business for the money.

362
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,441
Money's just
about keeping score.

363
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:55,776
I'm in this business
to win.

364
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,061
Well, here's the thing,
Tony.

365
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,729
This trial's
gonna take a while.

366
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:00,481
You'll be going
to hearing after hearing,

367
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,400
deposition
after deposition.

368
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,364
You won't be able
to enjoy your business at all.

369
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,186
So even if you win,
you lose.

370
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,572
Or?

371
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,957
Well, I...
I could withdraw the suit.

372
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:13,160
And all that'll cost you
is the truth,

373
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,463
that you colluded
with Cameron Dennis.

374
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,248
Ah, but I didn't
collude shit.

375
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,716
Yes, you did,

376
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,168
when you let him leak you
that video of Ava Hessington,

377
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:25,506
then tried to use it
to take over Hessington Oil.

378
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,153
All right,
so how do we celebrate?

379
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:36,424
Celebrate what?

380
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,234
Our first case
as a couple.

381
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,569
We should go
to that French place you like,

382
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,954
get a bottle of wine,

383
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,522
a couple of things that
I don't know how to pronounce,

384
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,491
and then go back
to my place and celebrate.

385
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,959
That's what we're calling it
these days?

386
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,128
Well, "victory sex"
seemed less romantic.

387
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,295
- Well, I can't tonight.
- Why not?

388
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,081
I have dinner
with my parents.

389
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,882
Maybe I could
come with you.

390
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,634
Um...Yeah, I--

391
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,336
Unless you don't
want me there.

392
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

393
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,056
You don't want me there.

394
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:01,508
Of course I do.

395
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,708
You don't look
like you do.

396
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,927
Is it because I'm white?

397
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,572
- That's not funny.
- Empirically it is.

398
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,347
No, it's not, and you're
acting like it's nothing.

399
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,315
Rachel, come on, look,
I know it's something,

400
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,903
but you're acting
like it's everything.

401
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:12,685
It is everything.

402
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,987
Wait a second.

403
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,107
Do you not want me to meet them
tonight or at all?

404
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,609
I don't want them
to find out your secret.

405
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,778
They're not
gonna find out.

406
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,913
- How do you know that?
- Because no one finds out.

407
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,950
You, Donna, Jessica,
you were all told.

408
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,419
Besides, I met your dad.
He didn't figure it out.

409
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,587
He met you as someone
that he wouldn't give

410
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,088
a second thought to,
Mike.

411
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,090
As my boyfriend,
he is going to put you

412
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,341
under the microscope.

413
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,127
- I can pass inspection.
- Well, what about me?

414
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,078
Because you might be experienced
at lying to the world,

415
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,597
but I'm not.

416
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,049
And it's not the world,
it's my family.

417
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,135
Okay, Rachel, you and I
have told each other

418
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,769
that we love
each other, right?

419
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:49,639
Did we mean that
or not?

420
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,474
If we did,
then at some point,

421
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,943
I am gonna have to meet
your parents.

422
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:57,363
Interview's in 20 minutes.
We should go.

423
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,321
Make yourself at home.

424
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,741
I wanted to talk to you
in here.

425
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,110
- Is this about your--
- No, no.

426
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:14,047
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

427
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,053
How'd it go
with Gianopolous?

428
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,954
Well,
he's not a pushover,

429
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,623
but I think we have
a good plan.

430
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,308
- So it went well?
- Yeah, it went well.

431
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,593
And since when are you--

432
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:29,679
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

433
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,848
I can see that.

434
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,132
You can see that?

435
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:35,485
That's all you have
to say?

436
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,270
Do you want me
to say more?

437
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,155
It depends
on what you would say.

438
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,691
I'd say, "when?"

439
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,243
Three days ago.

440
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,028
Why didn't
you tell me before?

441
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,529
I was going to,
but you got so upset

442
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:47,980
when you thought
I was working for him.

443
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,949
Because you work for me.

444
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,418
Well, I'm not working
for him.

445
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,153
Good.

446
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,490
So you're not upset.

447
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,841
No.

448
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,993
What you're doing with him
is personal.

449
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,995
- And this isn't?
- Donna,

450
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,164
I don't wanna make this a thing.
I don't either.

451
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,100
I just want to make sure
that it doesn't become a thing.

452
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,936
It won't as long as you
don't let that affect this.

453
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,022
Okay.

454
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,058
Miss Clark, do you know
Graham Stenton well?

455
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,509
We've worked together
for a while.

456
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,228
And you handle the books
for his accounts,

457
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,312
is that right?

458
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:20,697
Yes, that's right.

459
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,532
We just need to know
when exactly you became aware

460
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:26,286
that Mr. Stenton
was manipulating the numbers.

461
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,739
I don't believe he was.

462
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,524
Well,
the auditors disagree.

463
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,626
Well, I disagree with them.
Graham's a good person.

464
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,935
I'm sure Bernie Madoff's
friends all said the same thing.

465
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,213
That isn't fair.

466
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:38,414
And Graham
isn't the only person

467
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,779
who had access
to those accounts.

468
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,867
Mr. Oxnard, Mr. Dipetro,

469
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,754
several individuals
from the controller's office.

470
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,706
I just have
one question for you.

471
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,642
How long have you

627
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:57,145
and you're not gonna say them,
because I told you,

628
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:59,080
Rachel doesn't want you
grilling this poor young man.

629
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:00,281
- What?
- Mom.

630
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:01,666
You're not taking it easy
on me, are you?

631
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,151
- A little.
- You told me to rein him in.

632
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:04,442
I also told you
not to tell him.

633
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:05,870
That's not how we do things
in this family.

634
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,255
I'm not keeping things
from your father.

635
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,957
You kept it from me
when you scratched the car.

636
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,008
Robert,
eat your potatoes.

637
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,676
- [Laughs]
- What's so funny?

638
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,344
She's not consistent
with the potatoes.

639
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:14,829
She's not consistent
with anything.

640
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,497
Okay, you're not getting
any potatoes.

641
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,516
[Both laughing]
Now what's so funny?

642
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,351
Uh, I see
where she gets it from.

643
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:23,104
Both: Gets what?

644
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,556
You better shut up
and eat your potatoes.

645
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,724
Mmhmm.

646
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,149
She actually said
she'd prefer to rot in a cell?

647
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,067
Well, you've gotta give her
credit for that.

648
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:38,519
You do,
and she's right.

649
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:40,538
It's not making any sense.

650
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:43,408
If he's not making a run,
why is he dumping her shares?

651
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,860
- He's reacting.
- He's overreacting.

652
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:48,362
He may have money to burn,
but this isn't

653
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,465
tens of thousands,
it's tens of millions.

654
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:51,883
It's completely
out of proportion.

655
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,469
- Not exactly.
- What are you talking about?

656
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:57,922
I subpoenaed his daughter.

657
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,674
You what?

658
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:02,376
He fired our client,
so I struck back.

659
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:04,812
And you didn't think
to run that by me?

660
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,314
No, I didn't think
you'd say no.

661
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:08,233
I'd say no
because I'm not an idiot.

662
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:09,717
Idiot?

663
00:24:09,768 --> 00:24:11,102
We need this man
to help us.

664
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,937
You just made him
a permanent enemy.

665
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:14,856
Me?
We did this together.

666
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:17,158
- Don't put this on me.
- You're putting it on me.

667
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,526
Because you
goddamn did it!

668
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,657
You were going to go after him
no matter what I said.

669
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:21,663
I attacked his business.

670
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,281
You went after his family.
[Scoffs]

671
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't tell me you've never
done the same thing,

672
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:27,401
and what's the difference
between me doing it,

673
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,754
other than
the fact that--

674
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,290
ah.

675
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,592
I see.

676
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:37,595
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

677
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,015
This is about me
getting personal with Donna.

678
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:45,253
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

679
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:47,639
Is that
because she's listening?

680
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,474
I don't give a shit
if she hears it or not.

681
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,442
You crossed a line
with Gianopolous,

682
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:54,112
and you just crossed
another one with me.

683
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,698
You know, you've had it
in for me from the start.

684
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,983
And you've only been
with Donna for three days,

685
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:00,601
that should tell you
something.

686
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:02,570
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

687
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,989
You don't work my case
without me,

688
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:07,394
and since you seem to be having
trouble understanding that,

689
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,576
you don't work my case
at all.

690
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:11,579
Now get out of my office.

691
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:24,008
[Both laughing]

692
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,961
- So, Michael--
- Mike.

693
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:29,347
So now you're gonna tell me
what to call you?

694
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:32,133
No, I-I--it's--
people usually call me--

695
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:33,318
I'm just messing
with you.

696
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:35,737
[Both laughing]

697
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:38,740
So where are you from?
I grew up in Brooklyn.

698
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:41,192
Brothers, sisters?

699
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:42,744
Only child.

700
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:44,645
Parents still there?

701
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:46,331
They both died
when I was a kid.

702
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:49,817
Nah,
you're messing with me.

703
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:58,793
I just asked an orphan
about his dead parents

704
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:02,547
and made a joke about it,
didn't I?

705
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:03,998
Does he like apple
or blueberry?

706
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:05,516
Mom, shh, I'm trying to hear
what they're saying.

707
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:08,353
Rachel, relax,
he can handle your father.

708
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:09,887
How do you know?

709
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,639
Because you wouldn't have
brought him here if he couldn't.

710
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,476
Besides, what are you so afraid
they're gonna say?

711
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:17,695
You're right.
Nothing.

712
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,032
Honey, what is it?

713
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:27,655
You don't have
to tell me.

714
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:29,991
But just tell me this,

715
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,910
do you love him?

716
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:38,049
As long as he hasn't killed
someone, it'll all work out.

717
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,700
[Laughs]

718
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:43,805
[Laughs]
Come on.

719
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:51,512
I thought you were taking
the day off.

720
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,314
That was the day,
this is the night,

721
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:54,982
and my name is
still on the door.

722
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,935
It is.

723
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:02,023
- What do you want, Harvey?
- You were right.

724
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:03,825
We've had a lot
of disagreements lately.

725
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:05,226
Which one
are you referring to?

726
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:07,779
I'm not entirely sure
Stephen Huntley's judgment

727
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:09,230
is better than yours.

728
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,616
He went behind my back.

729
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,368
Going behind someone's back

730
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,569
doesn't seem like something
you have a problem with.

731
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:19,123
Maybe, but he hit Gianopolous
below the belt,

732
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,708
and now we have
a problem.

733
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,794
<i>We</i> have a problem?

734
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:24,879
You said your name
was still on the door.

735
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,849
I'm coming to you
for help.

736
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:33,187
What's our problem?

737
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,640
He's dumping
Hessington Oil shares

738
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:38,592
just to drive her
into the ground.

739
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,769
Well,
if we can come together,

740
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:50,154
maybe they
can come together.

741
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,457
- I'm listening.
- Tony Gianopolous

742
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:57,078
wants to own
Hessington Oil.

743
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:58,880
Ava wants to control it.

744
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:01,833
She sells him her shares,

745
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,384
he gives her
the voting rights.

746
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:05,636
And he gives up
Cameron Dennis.

747
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:09,340
They get what they want,
and so do we.

748
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,958
You think
he'll still go for it?

749
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:14,345
He'll know we're coming to him
because he won.

750
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,347
He won't be the problem.

751
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:17,849
Ava said she'd rather rot

752
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,768
than see him
take over her company.

753
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,687
I'll take care of Ava.

754
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,324
Look, it seems like
you two get along,

755
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:28,809
and I like you.
[Chuckles]

756
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:31,863
So I'm gonna
ask you this straight.

757
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:33,781
She's worked her ass off
to become a lawyer.

758
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:35,149
I know.

759
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,080
Well, I don't want anything
to stand in her way.

760
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,319
I would never do that.

761
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,088
So what happens
when she gets into Stanford?

762
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:47,345
You didn't know
she applied there.

763
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:52,500
Looks like you two
have something to talk about.

764
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:02,122
You're awfully
quiet this morning.

765
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,477
- Just tired.
- Still?

766
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,165
I mean, you went home
right after dinner last night.

767
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,334
Yeah,
trouble sleeping.

768
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:10,203
Is something wrong?

769
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:12,089
Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

770
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,807
Mr. Stenton, I guess
you got our message.

771
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,310
Oh, I did,
and now I've got one for you.

772
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:19,062
Beth and I got married
this morning.

773
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:20,714
You married a woman
to protect yourself?

774
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:22,266
I married her
because I love her.

775
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,567
But you did it
to make any conversation

776
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:25,235
that the two of you had
privileged.

777
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,987
Says the lawyer
who threatened her.

778
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:29,740
Well, now you take this
to trial, she won't testify.

779
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,942
Well, it's too bad
spousal privilege

780
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,577
doesn't apply
to bullshit marriages.

781
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,279
Yeah, good luck
arguing that.

782
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,604
We offered the two of you
a chance to give back the money

783
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,366
and walk away, but
after we prove you did this--

784
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,251
Oh, you can't prove
I did a thing.

785
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,588
And now, you can't force her
to prove it for you either.

786
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,414
You never returned my call
last night.

787
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:55,933
Well, what could be different
about last night

788
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:58,769
than the night before?
Hmm?

789
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,771
Maybe the fact
that you went to Harvey

790
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:02,973
and you threw me
in his face.

791
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:06,092
Um, I was just telling it
how it was.

792
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:07,945
He's already
got it in for us anyway.

793
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:11,482
Well, that's my business
with him, not yours.

794
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:14,201
You're right.
I'm sorry.

795
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:17,654
I never wanted to make things
awkward for you and Harvey.

796
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:22,042
You made things awkward
for you and me.

797
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,127
- Donna--
- I like you, Stephen,

798
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,013
and I have enjoyed
our short-term arrangement,

799
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,831
but I don't enjoy
complications.

800
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,385
I don't either,
but it seems we have one.

801
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:35,722
Now, I'm affected by you
more than I thought,

802
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,725
and I'm finding I'd like
to extend our term.

803
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:45,632
I'll take your offer
under advisement.

804
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:57,828
I am not selling my shares
to that man.

805
00:30:57,912 --> 00:30:59,580
I don't know you
that well, Ava,

806
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,314
and I won't pretend
that I do,

807
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,916
but we do have something
in common.

808
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,084
What is that?

809
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:05,953
I merged
with Edward Darby

810
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,788
to save my firm
from being hijacked

811
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,590
by my piece of shit
ex-partner.

812
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:12,175
And what exactly
does that give us in common?

813
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,878
I know what it's like
to prefer rotting in the ground

814
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:18,549
than letting my enemy
take what's mine.

815
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,350
I said,
"rotting in a cell."

816
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:22,052
I wasn't
up on murder charges.

817
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:23,503
And you'd rather
have died?

818
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:25,939
I was speaking metaphorically,
as I'm sure you were.

819
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,724
Was I?

820
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:30,193
You won't be able
to run your company from a cell.

821
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,178
My point is,

822
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,314
I didn't want to merge,

823
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:37,234
but I did what I had to do
to keep my company mine.

824
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:40,186
And how is that
working out for you?

825
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:42,372
It has
its ups and downs,

826
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:44,858
but I wouldn't be
standing here in front of you

827
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,293
if I hadn't done it.

828
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,912
Not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

829
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:51,331
Ava...

830
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:54,534
Do this.
Get free of your murder charges.

831
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:57,504
Nobody is saying we can't try

832
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:01,475
to get you
out of this deal later.

833
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,760
I don't care what it takes,
I'm not losing to that guy.

834
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:05,596
We need to find a way
around spousal privilege.

835
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,880
I don't see how we can.
[Chuckles]

836
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,398
Stupid goddamn law.
Excuse me.

837
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:10,734
It's not entirely stupid.

838
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,436
Oh, what, so now,
you're on his side?

839
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,220
No, privilege exists
for a reason.

840
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:15,388
You don't want
to have to worry

841
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,323
about what you trust
your partner with.

842
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,407
That's assuming your partner

843
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:18,575
even trusts you
in the first place.

844
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,060
What is that even
supposed to mean?

845
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:23,664
It means, when were you gonna
tell me you applied to Stanford?

846
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:36,209
Okay, so that's why you've
barely said three words to me

847
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,679
since last night.
My dad told you.

848
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:41,027
No, no, he didn't tell me,
he asked me how I felt about it

849
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,529
because he assumed I knew,
like I know

850
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,551
about all the East Coast schools
that you applied to.

851
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:45,686
- Mike--
- First you didn't want me

852
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,220
to meet your parents,
and now this?

853
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,755
Yeah, and I changed my mind
about you meeting my parents,

854
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:51,274
which I'm now
beginning to regret.

855
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,976
Oh, why, because I found out
you hid something from me?

856
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:54,461
Like you never
hid anything from me.

857
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:56,480
I hid something from you,
it kept us apart.

858
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:59,099
What brought us together
was me telling you everything.

859
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,319
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

860
00:33:02,403 --> 00:33:04,938
Before I went,
on Friday.

861
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:10,127
You're going there?

862
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,412
I got an interview.
I'm sorry.

863
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:13,714
I just didn't know
how to tell you, mi--

864
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:14,881
- I don't know, how about,
"Hey, Mike,

865
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,717
I might go to law school
3,000 miles away"?

866
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,264
I don't even know
if I'm gonna get in,

867
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:20,053
which is exactly why I didn't
want to have this conversation.

868
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:21,672
No, you didn't want to have it
because you might go there

869
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:25,342
and you're too afraid
to say it.

870
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:29,596
Okay.
I might want to go there.

871
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,898
I've said it.

872
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,361
[Knock at door]

873
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:46,079
You may enter.

874
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:49,149
I'm afraid I've got
a bit of a sticky wicket.

875
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:51,952
That sounds uncomfortable.

876
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:54,671
The Hong Kong office urgently
requires me for a few weeks.

877
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,289
Normally,
I'd bring Mikado, but--

878
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,708
Whoa, wait,
are you asking me to--

879
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,543
I can't get her papers
in time.

880
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:01,211
She'd be facing quarantine.

881
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:02,328
She'd sooner die.

882
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,497
You already
understand her so well.

883
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,499
I do, yet a request
of this magnitude--

884
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:10,103
No, you're probably right,
it's too much to ask.

885
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:13,890
I'm sure there is
a suitable luxury feline hotel.

886
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:16,443
Don't play games, okay?
We both know there isn't.

887
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,447
- So you'll do it?
- N--yes, can I have her?

888
00:34:20,514 --> 00:34:21,865
[Knock at door]
Do you have a minute?

889
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,400
I don't really feel like
talking about us right now.

890
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:25,869
It's not about that.
Our discussion gave me an idea.

891
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:28,021
Our discussion?

892
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:30,190
Can we please not fight
about what to call our fight?

893
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,458
What's the idea?

894
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:33,043
We don't do good cop,
bad cop anymore.

895
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,128
We do bad cop, bad cop.

896
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:38,031
The way I'm feeling right now,
yeah, I can do bad cop.

897
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:42,252
Since when
do you come out here?

898
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:44,471
Since they added
Asiago cheese.

899
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,507
Your reward of choice
for a job well done.

900
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:48,892
You remember that story?

901
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:51,094
First story you ever told me.
You think I'd forget?

902
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,729
That wasn't
the point of the story.

903
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:55,899
- I assume you got Ava to agree.
- Yes, I did.

904
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,651
Should I be buying you
an Asiago bagel?

905
00:34:57,718 --> 00:34:59,903
Poppy seed.

906
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:01,387
The "good news, bad news"
bagel.

907
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,023
Gianopolous agreed
to the deal.

908
00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:04,224
He gave up
Cameron Dennis.

909
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:05,575
What's the bad news?

910
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,160
Cameron
protected himself.

911
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:09,746
He never explicitly told
Gianopolous about the tape

912
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,414
and never actually
showed him the tape.

913
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,000
So what's
the good news?

914
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,203
He never explicitly
said anything,

915
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:21,258
but he left Gianopolous alone
in the room with that tape.

916
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:34,115
Late night?

917

No, Nigel's cat.

unless it's precisely
5.5 degrees celsius,

she turned her nose up
at Bruno's origami collection,

925

and she won't use her litter box
unless it's facing London.

that glow today, Donna.

I took
a couple nights off.

Is this
because of Harvey?

'Cause I don't care
what he says, Donna,

you can't let work
get in the way of that glow.

you're right.

00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:17,565
I'm gonna schedule
an extra long session tonight.

937
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,518
Ooh, can I come?

938
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,744
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

939
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:31,579
I'm here to tell you
that you lost.

940
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:33,581
I didn't lose.
I may not have much time,

941
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:36,417
but I still got--
That tape?

942
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:39,470
Not anymore,
unless you want to dispute

943
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:41,372
Tony Gianopolous'
sworn statement

944
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:44,375
that you left him alone
with it.

945
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,402
I can fight this.

946
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:55,607
Chain of custody
is something

947
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:57,522
I know a little bit about,
thanks to you.

948
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:58,940
That tape is gone,
and so are you.

949
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:01,526
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Admit it, Cameron, I beat you.

950
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:04,895
Save yourself the embarrassment,
and cancel this trial.

951
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:06,914
If you think
I would ever do that,

952
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:09,233
I taught you
even less than I thought.

953
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:12,236
This case was 50/50.
All you did was make it 80/20.

954
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:13,788
99 to 1.

955
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,840
It could be a million to one
for all I care.

956
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:19,293
We're in the ring, I'm still
standing, and this isn't done.

957
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:22,847
Now get out of my face.
I got a trial to prepare for.

958
00:37:30,922 --> 00:37:32,773
- What do you want?
- This is a request

959
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:34,525
for charges to be filed
against Graham Stenton

960
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:36,093
for stealing $30 million.

961
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:38,265
The penalty for which
is 15 years in a federal prison.

962
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:39,430
If you had proof of that,
you wouldn't have

963
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,781
come after me
in the first place.

964
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,433
We have proof that you knew
something was wrong

965
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:44,101
and you didn't notify
your employer.

966
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:45,436
Which is why
this is a request for charges

967
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:48,122
to be filed against you
as an accessory after the fact.

968
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,958
The penalty for which is
five years in a federal prison.

969
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,628
But you can avoid that
by testifying against him.

970
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:56,881
Even if I was willing to,
I can't.

971
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,799
We're married.
He'd stop me from testifying.

972
00:37:58,884 --> 00:38:00,885
In New York,
not in Connecticut.

973
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,386
Which is where the charges
will be filed.

974
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:04,889
You're asking me
to turn against the man I love.

975
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,507
Then go to jail
and trust him.

976
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,060
I'm guessing he's not gonna
be there when you get out.

977
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:11,979
Beth,
even if he waits for you,

978
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:14,932
he did this, and the fear
of him getting caught

979
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,984
is going to cast a shadow
over every moment

980
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:21,155
of the rest of your life
together.

981
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,158
He may not be able to see that,
but I know you can.

982
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:36,170
I'll get you
the money back.

983
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,094
What are you doing?

984
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:44,879
Just leaving a note.

985
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:48,666
By the way,
congratulations.

986
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:50,101
I hear you got the tape
thrown out

987
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:52,553
and Ava reinstated
as the CEO.

988
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:54,939
- In spite of you.
- Yeah, I know.

989
00:38:55,006 --> 00:38:58,025
You went to Jessica
for help.

990
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,228
- You have a problem with that?
- No.

991
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:03,681
I just think it's ironic
that she doesn't realize

992
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:07,017
she just helped me
dig her own grave.

993
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:15,076
[Knock at door]
It's me.

994
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:22,383
Money got wired
into the account.

995
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,702
Congratulations.

996
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,170
I don't think
she would've caved

997
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:29,056
if you hadn't broken script
and gone all good cop on me.

998
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,260
[Chuckles]

999
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,678
Look, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry-

1000
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:35,680
Rachel--
No, Mike.

1001
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,682
We're in a fight
because I made the mistake

1002
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:40,884
of not telling you that I was
considering going to Stanford,

1003
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:42,052
but we're really
in a fight

1004
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:44,555
because I'm considering
going to Stanford.

1005
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:48,492
What you said to Beth,
was that really about me?

1006
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,921
- Mike, come on.
- Because you said

1007
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:52,580
the fear of him getting caught
was gonna cast a shadow

1008
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:54,749
over every minute of the rest
of their life together.

1009
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,119
If you're asking
if it's occurred to me

1010
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:03,874
that going to Stanford
could be a fresh start...

1011
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:04,875
Yeah.

1012
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:06,844
It has,
but the truth is

1013
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:09,246
I may or may not
get into Yale or Columbia,

1014
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,299
and you were the one
that told me

1015
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:14,101
that it'd be stupid
if I didn't just cover my bases,

1016
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:18,022
so I just need to go
and see if I even get in or not.

1017
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:20,224
I get it.

1018
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:21,225
I get all of it.

1019
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:22,316
I just can't stop thinking

1020
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,979
about what will happen
if you do.

1021
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,700
You came to the decision

1022
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:32,653
to let me in on your secret
on your own,

1023
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:36,574
and I just need you
to give me the freedom

1024
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,660
to come to this decision
on my own.

1025

[Soft rock music]

1026
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,449
I'm not one
for sentimental gestures,

1027
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,501
but I was thinking
about when Hardman came back

1028
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,954
and you and I got into it.

1029
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,973
You got me
my tea set back.

1030
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:55,292
You here to thank me
for that?

1031
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:58,462
I'm here with a gesture
of my own.

1032
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,737
This isn't a tea set.

1033
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:10,324
It's going up on the wall
tomorrow.

1034
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,026
I asked for that
a while ago.

1035
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,494
You said I wasn't ready.

1036
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:15,529
I also said
I wasn't just going to slap

1037
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:19,417
someone else's name up there
next to mine, but I did.

1038
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:23,788
And now you regret it.

1039
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,457
And you're playing chess
again.

1040

What does that mean?

1041
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:30,711
It means, I want to know
if this is a gesture

1042
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:33,881
or if it's a move.

1043
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:38,602
What it is,
is my way of showing you

1044
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,005
that Darby's treating me
the same way I treated you,

1045

and I understand
how you felt.

1046

You don't like it,

1047
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:52,817
and this is your way
of getting me on your side.

believe me,
