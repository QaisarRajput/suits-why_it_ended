<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:03,145
Listening to his
closing argument,

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,669
I almost want
to let him go myself,

4
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,203
except for one thing--
he's a liar.

5
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,339
He thinks he doesn't have
to play by the same rules.

6
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,841
But we know he does.

7
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,410
- What did you do?
- I pled guilty.

8
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,145
If you think I'm gonna
let you do this,

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,813
you're out
of your goddamn mind.

10
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:18,015
He cut a deal
to save this firm.

11
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,318
He cut a deal to keep us
from going to prison.

12
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,253
We give Evan people
who already want to go,

13
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,488
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers
in exchange for Mike.

14
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,891
And what if it doesn't work
and we lose everything?

15
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,361
Then we do. But if we don't
try to save him, who are we?

16
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,496
Make the deal.

17
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,065
I am not letting you
go to prison

18
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,566
for a crime
that I committed.

19
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,035
I'm not letting you go when
you're gonna be found innocent!

20
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,337
Why the hell would
you lie to me?

21
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,005
'Cause the truth
would've broken you.

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,206
You know what, Harvey?

23
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,507
You want to come to my wedding,
you let me know.

24
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,009
[glass shatters]

25
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,911
I'm not trying to take
your place anymore.

26
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,546
I'm trying to get you ready
because you're weak.

27
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,350
- Harvey, I am not weak.
- Yeah? Well, hit me.

28
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,451
Is this what you want?

29
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,486
That I hate you
and that you made me do this?

30
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,556
We lose everything
because of you!

31
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,894
I am not saying that
I don't want to get married.

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,262
You go finish law school.

33
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,897
And then in two years,
when I get out,

34
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,867
if you still want
to marry me...

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,738
They're all gone.

36
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,109
Watch your back
in there, Mike.

37
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,944
I will.

General wake-up
for all inmates is at 6:00 a.m.

41
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,991
You will be standing next
to your bed at that time.

42
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,927
If you are not, you will face
disciplinary action.

43
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,329
At least five inmate counts

44
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,264
will be held
during each 24-hour period

45
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,033
at random times.

46
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,235
You will stand still during
every one of those counts.

47
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,338
If you are not, you will face
disciplinary action.

48
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,407
You will be at meals on time
if you want to eat.

49
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,842
You will be at work on time,
no matter what.

50
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,879
You will keep your cell in
a clean and sanitary condition.

51
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,982
If you fail in any of these
areas, you will face...

52
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,283
Disciplinary action.

53
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:02,219
Good.
You're getting the picture.

54
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,822
Do you mind if I ask
what disciplinary action means?

55
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:06,357
Since you got the balls
to ask that,

56
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,794
I'm sure you're gonna
find out soon enough.

57
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,295
- What's this for?
- What do you think it's for?

Strip naked, put everything
you own inside that bag,

59
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,433
then follow me.

60
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,550
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

61
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,486
I came to let you know
that I dropped him off,

62
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:40,458
and, um, he looks as good
as he could look.

63
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,359
And I think
he's gonna be okay.

64
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,961
I appreciate that.

65
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,796
But you could have told me
that over the phone.

66
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,132
So what are you
really doing here?

67
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,501
I miss him.

68
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,138
I miss him too.

69
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,279
- Where the hell are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

70
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,015
I'm going home, Louis.
Look, don't you get it?

71
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,084
They're all gone--
every single one of them.

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,486
Yeah, well,
we knew that already.

73
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,087
No, no,
I don't think you understand.

74
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,889
I'm not just talking
about the partners.

75
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,791
I'm talking about everyone,
from the accountants

76
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,494
to the secretaries to the guy
who shines my shoes, Donna.

77
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,895
All of them, gone.

78
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,497
And what exactly do you
want me to do about it?

79
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,932
I want you to get Harvey
on the goddamn phone.

80
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,534
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

81
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,803
Because tonight's not
the night to call Harvey.

82
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,104
Why, because of Mike?

83
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,906
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Mike is gone,

84
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,441
along with everybody else.

85
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,809
And if we don't figure
something out by tonight,

86
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,911
we are gonna be left
with nothing.

87
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,980
I didn't say we weren't gonna
figure something out, Louis.

88
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,414
I said we're not
calling Harvey.

89
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,716
Well, then what the hell
are we gonna do?

90
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,317
Right now
I'm gonna go to my office

91
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,753
and fix myself
a goddamn drink.

92
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,792
The first time I met him?

93
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,393
What do you think
I thought?

94
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,895
I...

95
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,229
I thought he was an idiot.

96
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,464
Imagine how I felt

97
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,399
when a bunch of weed spilled
out of his briefcase

98
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,234
ten seconds after he walked
into his interview.

99
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,236
I know. You were so horrified,
you got on the phone,

100
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,337
and you called the police.

101
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,473
No, wait.
You didn't do that.

102
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,041
You offered
the idiot a job.

103
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,843
That's because
after I heard his story,

104
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,945
I knew he wasn't
an idiot after all.

105
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,880
And I knew by the end
of that first morning

106
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,849
that he wasn't like anyone
I'd ever met,

107
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,920
and that if I wasn't careful,
I was gonna be in trouble.

108
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,390
- To trouble.
- To trouble.

109
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,426
[cell phone vibrates]

110
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,300
[chuckles] Look at that.
Louis left me a voice mail.

111
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,268
I don't understand.
You seem happy about that.

112
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,037
That's because one
of my favorite pastimes

113
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,705
is to listen
to one of Louis's messages.

114
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,540
What if he's upset
about something?

115
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,042
He's always upset
about something.

116
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,710
That's why one
of my favorite pastimes

117
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,179
is to listen to one
of Louis's messages.

118
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,114
<i>Damn it, Harvey,</i>
<i>pick up the goddamn phone,</i>

119

I got to go.

127
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,896
Yeah, I know.
I'm coming with you.

128
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,297
Rachel, you heard
what Louis said.

129
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,233
This is gonna be a rough night.
You need to stay here.

130
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,935
Harvey, it's gonna be a rough
night no matter where I am.

131
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,337
And at least
if I'm with you,

132
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,838
there's a chance
that I could be of some use.

133
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,375
You better get your coat,
because we don't have much time.

134
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,384
Now what?

135
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,721
Now you get dressed,
and you wait.

136
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,192
Would you like
some more drinks?

137
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,895
Can I offer you an appetizer,
maybe some truffle fries,

138
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,429
or are we allowed
to talk business now?

139
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,965
All right, Louis,
what do you think we should do,

140
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,400
since it was
your recommendation

141
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,869
that landed us in this mess
in the first place?

142
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,704
I recommended that because
it was a last-ditch effort

143
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,972
to get Mike out of prison.

144
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,874
And you also said
we'd only lose 50%

145
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,809
of our partners
to Evan Smith.

146
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,378
How could I have known
that she had the capacity

147
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,446
to bring on more than that?
Don't you get it?

148
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,915
The rest didn't go
to Evan Smith.

149
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,250
They just walked the hell out
and went somewhere else.

150
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,885
Then we can sue
their asses.

151
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,154
With what lawyers,
what resources, and what money?

152
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,989
Because I don't know
if you noticed,

153
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,758
but this firm has been gutted
because of your recommendation.

154
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,860
No, Jessica, it was gutted
because of mine.

155
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,561
Damn it, Louis.
I told you not to call him.

156

Well, I did.
Because he's a partner,

he was the one

Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt,

You call me down here

Well, I'm pretty sure
this is the right place,

00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,838
I can do it
in the next two minutes.

309
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:03,140
Well, it's a good thing
I have them right here.

310
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:11,782
Um, no offense, but I'm really
more of a lone ranger.

311
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,250
- Excuse me?
- I can get this done

312
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:14,518
in a more efficient manner

313
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,520
without you looking
over my shoulder.

314
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:17,855
Well, that's what I told
my mother

315
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,423
when I looked
at my first "Playboy."

316
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,859
But it didn't happen then,
and it's not gonna happen now.

because...

we have a problem.

320
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,204
So you're saying,

at any given moment,

322
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,107
there's $100,000 hidden away.

323
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:39,076
- That's what I'm saying.
- Where?

324
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:40,244
I'm not telling you.

Whatever the hell you two

it's gonna have to wait,

327
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,115
because secretaries
may talk to secretaries,

328
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,317
but liars talk to idiots.

Louis, what the hell
are you talking about?

I'm saying that that list

her ass from her elbow.

Watch yourself, Louis.

334

I don't need
to watch myself, Harvey.

See, I don't know
if you've noticed,

00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,129
but we're being sued
for a $100 million.

337
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,131
The partners are gone,
and we can't stop them.

338
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,499
Maybe we don't have
to stop them.

339
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,934
What are you saying?

340
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,669
What I want to know right now
is what we're all worth.

What, are you kidding?

Why don't you just jam
a cattle prod up my ass?

343
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:09,340
It would be less invasive.

There you go, resorting
to violence, like you always do.

347

Because you don't want to admit
this whole thing

348
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,781
is your fault
in the first place.

If I hadn't brought Mike in,

352

And if I hadn't given
Donna back to you,

353
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,689
you'd still be
having panic attacks

That's enough!

I just watched the man
that I love go to prison

358
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,432
so none of you have to.

359
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,968
And it hasn't been
five minutes...

360
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,906

I thought I wanted
to be alone tonight.

363
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,147
And then I realized
that I didn't,

364
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:53,918
because I wanted to be
with my family.

365
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:56,387
But if you can't keep it
together tonight...

366
00:13:56,422 --> 00:14:00,658
of all nights, then as far
as I'm concerned...

367
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:03,160
you can all rot in hell.

368
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,832
Well, I'm gonna say
what she won't.

369

This is all on you.

370
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:13,504
Louis, this is the last place
I wanted to be tonight too,

371
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,607
but I came back here
to save my firm anyway.

372
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:19,143
But if you're gonna be
the same old Louis

373
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:21,145
and we're going to do
the same old dance,

374
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,382
then maybe you and this firm
can both go rot in hell.

375
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,897
Louis, I don't want
to hear it.

376
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,766
Well, that's good,
because I'm not here to say it.

377
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,634
Are you saying you didn't
come down here

378
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,102
to tell me Harvey
can go to hell?

379
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,738
I'm saying I came down here
to tell you,

380
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:57,408
if Harvey wants to go...

381
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:59,243
we should let him.
Oh, Louis.

382
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,714
Jessica, you once told me,
no matter what happens,

383
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,918
Pearson will always consider
Litt her partner,

384
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:12,056
which means whatever happens
with Harvey...

385
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,091
we can do this together.

386
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:19,530
What do you say--
you and me?

387

00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,836
Wow.
You say no.

- No, Louis--
- I should have known.

390
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,173
You never wanted me.

391

All you ever wanted
was your precious Harvey.

Louis, you have no idea
what I want.

And my hesitation has nothing
to do with you.

It sunk.

And I don't know
if I have it in me

I answered every one

I didn't say you didn't.

What does that even mean?

418
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:36,140
It means that they know
they don't have the patience

to earn what they want,

00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,988
So, if you had just
stopped one trade sooner,

619
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:35,757
they might never have
even caught you.

620
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:38,526
Yeah, I could've stopped five,
four, three trades sooner.

621
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:40,528
They might not have.
But how do you know?

622
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:41,696
I'll tell you
how you know.

623
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:43,364
You stop when you have
enough money

624
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,033
to put your kids
through college.

625
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:48,570
Yeah, but what college?

626
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:51,673
And what if they want
to go to med school?

627
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,575
And what if they need a car?

628
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,109
And then
somewhere along the way,

629
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,011
you stop thinking
about if they need a car,

630
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,614
and you start thinking,
"I need a car."

631
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:01,082
And that's when
you get caught,

632
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:04,786
because whether you want
to admit it to yourself or not,

633
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,690
you were never thinking
about them in first place.

634
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:11,693
And whether you
were or weren't,

635
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:15,430
once you start,
you don't stop.

636
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,600
That's one hell
of a story, Frank.

637
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,069
Yeah, well,
this is prison.

638
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:25,173
Everyone's got
a hell of a story.

639
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,643
Anyway, that's enough
for one night.

640
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:30,678
I'm gonna go to bed.

641
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:36,618
My story started
with my grandmother.

642
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,219
She was sick,

643
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:41,656
and she needed money...

644
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:44,392
and I found a way
to get it for her.

645
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,367
Holy shit.

646
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,602
This is
the best thing ever.

647
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:57,171
I love the both of you
so much.

648
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:00,542
- This is your doing.
- Harvey, we're making progress.

649
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,011
Holy shit. This is
the best egg roll ever.

650
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:04,546
Jesus Christ,
get me out of here.

651
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,180
This is so awesome.

652
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:07,682
I mean, I haven't been
this stress-free

653
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,985
since I took gold
in the Math-lympics

654
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:12,954
and Esther went to fat camp
in the same week.

655
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:14,122
Esther went to fat camp?

656
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:15,690
They called it
Violin All-Stars,

657
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,559
but we all know
what that's code for.

658
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,628
And if you so much as picture
her in a school-girl outfit.

659
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,530
Come on, Louis,
we're all feeling good.

660
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:23,765
You telling me
you never slipped up

661
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,600
and had an inappropriate
relationship?

662
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:27,402
Louis, I do not want
to know the answer to that.

663
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,471
I did. It was the most
shameful night of my life.

664
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:31,606
Harvey, don't--

665
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:32,874
What exactly was so shameful
about it?

666
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,176
Well, she was a paralegal,

667
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:37,211
and I took mud with her.

668
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:38,713
I don't understand.

669
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,949
Are you saying you sullied
her reputation?

670
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:43,151
No, I'm saying I sullied
the concept of mud.

671
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,619
What the hell
are you talking about?

672
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:46,020
What, do I need
a bullhorn?

673
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:48,089
I had a premature muddification.
What the hell does that mean?

674
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,591
I think we all know
what that means.

675
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,225
It means I couldn't
hold my mud.

676
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:54,262
I still don't know
what that means.

677
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,598
Did you take a shit in the mud?
No, that's disgusting.

678
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, what part of this
conversation isn't disgusting?

679
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:01,469
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this.

680
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:02,770
Who exactly was it?

681
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,105
I cannot tell you
that information.

682
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,940
Okay, good, because
the truth is, I don't--

683
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,241
It was Missy Dietler.

684
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:08,710
Louis, I'm gonna ask you
a question.

685
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:11,045
I want you
to tell me the truth.

686
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:13,081
Does Missy Dietler know
you couldn't hold your mud?

687
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:14,116
Oh, heavens no.

688
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,316
The Turkish silt
was thick enough

689
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:16,651
to prevent her
from feeling it, so...

690
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:20,688
Was it thick enough to hide
you wanting to go sleep after?

691
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,123
My God, she knew.

692
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,592
I got news for you, Louis.
They always know.

693
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:28,229
Oh, you're so right.

694
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:31,666
You're so right.

695
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:32,834
She--

696
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,836
I need
15 minutes to myself.

697
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:37,238
[both laughing]

698
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:46,725
And that's it.

699
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:48,527
I cut a deal,
and now I'm here.

700
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:49,895
Wait a second.

701
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:52,097
If you're a fake lawyer,
they had to give you a chance

702
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,600
to turn on someone
to get out of it.

703
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,569
They did.

704
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,470
So why the hell
didn't you do it?

705
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,673
Because I wouldn't have been
able to live with myself.

706
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:04,043
Somebody out there
owes you a lot.

707
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,178
Yeah, well...

708
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:08,047
I owe him a lot too.

709
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,616
So, what, you're--

710
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:14,119
you're like a-a good guy
or something?

711
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:16,689
[scoffs]

712
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:17,923
Am I?

713
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,158
What do you mean?

714
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:21,527
I left the woman I love
at the altar today.

715
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:22,761
Why'd you do that?

716
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:24,396
Because I didn't want
to chain her to me

717
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:29,068
if there was even the chance
that she would regret it.

718
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:32,538
Then, yeah,
you're a good guy.

719
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:34,139
Thanks, Frank.

720
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,511
One thing about everyone
being gone...

721
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,548
we got the run
of the place.

722
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,451
I never knew what the ceiling
looked like in here.

723
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,457
It's like
"The Breakfast Club."

724
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,892
Do you ever not
quote a movie?

725
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:55,728
No, and you got a problem
with that, frankly, my dear,

726
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,129
I don't give a damn.

727
00:29:57,164 --> 00:30:00,165
You're an idiot.

728
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:02,268
You think Louis is gonna
be okay with me now?

729
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:03,469
[footsteps approaching]

730
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,738
I think we're about
to find out.

731
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:07,906
Harvey,
what I was saying before...

732
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,208
You don't need
to say anything, Louis.

733
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,442
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

734
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:12,177
That's not what
I was gonna say.

735
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,113
It's not the only inappropriate
relationship I ever had.

736
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,515
I recorded you saying
that you knew about Mike,

737
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,450
and I almost gave it
to Anita Gibbs.

738
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:20,586
- Did you know about this?
- No.

739
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,087
But I suspected
when he tried to get me

740
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:24,056
to turn you in
to Gibbs with him.

741
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,991
And what exactly was
your response to that request?

742
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,493
She said we didn't need
to do that,

743
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:31,497
and if it came to it, you would
take the bullet for both of us.

744
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:34,500
- I would have.
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

745
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,001
I almost
ruined your life.

746
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:37,670
You don't need
to be sorry, Louis.

747
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:40,773
The truth is, I'm the one
that ruined all of our lives,

748
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,509
when I hired Mike.

749
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:47,579
And I never apologized
to either one of you for it,

750
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:50,649
but I will now.

751
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:53,052
I'm sorry.

752
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:54,553
So...

753
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:58,123
we good?

754
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,726
We're good.

755
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:03,562
All right, now that the two
of you have made peace,

756
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,397
let's figure out
how we're gonna win this war,

757
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:08,167
which starts with knowing how
much we have in our war chest.

758
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,468
What exactly
does that mean?

759
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,736
It means it's time

760
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:13,072
to answer the question
that she asked two hours ago.

761
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,273
How much money do we have?

762
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,574
This again?

763
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:17,209
Louis, after everything
we've been through tonight,

764
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:18,510
how hard could it be
for us to write down

765
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,112
how much we're worth
right now?

766
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,081
I need another 15 minutes
to myself.

767
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,050
- Again?
- Aw, Harvey, let him go.

768
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:27,052
He probably doesn't have
as much as we do,

769
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,721
and it's a vulnerable thing
for him.

770
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,089
"Vulnerable"?

771
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:32,825
He just told us he jerked off
in the mud an hour ago.

772
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,427
You don't think he's gonna do
that right now, do you?

773
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:36,695
Based on
what he told us,

774
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,098
he doesn't need
15 minutes for that.

775
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,266
[laughs]

776
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,208
You want to call her?

777
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:52,378
What?

778
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,613
Your fiancée,
you want to call her?

779
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:56,281
What are you
talking about?

780
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,017
I'm talking about
my first night in here.

781
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,086
I remember thinking
what I wouldn't give

782
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:03,155
to let Jennifer know
I was okay.

783
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,458
The thing is, I couldn't,
but you can.

784
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,460
I thought we weren't allowed
to have phones in here.

785
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:11,563
Yeah, well, I wasn't allowed
to make inside trades either.

786
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,033
But I did,
and now I'm in here.

787
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,437
What else are they
gonna do?

788
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:21,440
Uh, thanks, but...

789
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,542
I just...

790
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:26,578
I just can't right now.

791
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:30,416
Whenever you want,
phone's right here.

792
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:33,118
Let's try to get
some shut-eye, man.

793
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,494
You okay?

794
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,597
He's everywhere.

795
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:49,168
He's all around
here, Donna.

796
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,069
The first place
we met was down the hallway.

797
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:53,705
And the first time we kissed
was in the library.

798
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:57,443
And I met his grandmother
50 feet from here.

799
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,711
And right here,
he told me the truth.

800
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:01,280
- Rachel--
- He was standing

801
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,048
right where you are,
and I was upset with him

802
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,751
about something
that I don't even remember.

803
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:10,189
And then he told me that he had
lost everyone in his life,

804
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,758
and then he told me
he was a fraud.

805
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,896
And then we...
Mm.

806
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:23,569
- You're gonna get through this.
- I know.

807
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,003
I just wish I could see him.

808
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,505
What do you mean?
You can see him.

809
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,607
No, I can't.
I called the prison.

810
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,042
You called
the prison tonight?

811
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,211
Yes, because I wanted
to know if he was okay.

812
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,746
And they...

813
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:37,149
they wouldn't give me
any information.

814
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,084
So then I asked them
about visitation,

815
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,919
and they said
that I had to wait,

816
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,754
and I had to get
on a list, and--

817
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,423
How long?

818
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,025
At least a month.

819
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:50,696
I don't know what to say.

820
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:53,632
You always know
what to say.

821
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,201
Not this time.

822
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:02,975
Excuse me, ladies.

823
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,043
Sorry to interrupt, but I think
we might have a problem.

824
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:08,413
- What is it, Benjamin?
- We're being hacked.

825
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,023
Oh, that's a tidy little sum
you got there.

826
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:19,725
You're not doing
so bad yourself.

827
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,059
No, I am not.

828
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,061
Not bad for two people
that came from nothing.

829
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:25,163
I didn't come from nothing,
and you know it.

830
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,100
Bet it still feels pretty good
to write that number down.

831
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,369
Oh, it sure does.

832
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,904
[imitates explosion]

833
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,539
You're still a little high,
aren't you?

834
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,641
I sure am.

835
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:37,743
There. You wanted you
wanted to know my net worth.

836
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,611
You got it.

837
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,580
- Holy shit.
- Who are you?

838
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,549
- Are you a king?
- No, I'm just not an idiot.

839
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,050
What the hell have you been
doing with your money?

840
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,451
Louis, we're not
exactly poor.

841
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:48,220
That's what Bolivia says
to the U.S.,

842
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,988
but if NATO goes to war,
they're not kicking in dick.

843
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,757
Well, if you're so damn rich,
why didn't you pony up

844
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,692
for Donna's salary
when you had the chance?

845
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,427
Do you even know how to spell
"fiscal responsibility"?

846
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:56,595
I know how
to spell "cheap."

847
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,863
All right, that's enough.

848
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,131
At least now we know

849
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,699
we have enough to fund
ourselves for a while.

850
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,501
You guys have
two rich uncles?

851
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,870
'Cause I'm not carrying your
asses if this thing drags out.

852
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,538
Louis, this is a team effort,
and I swear to God,

853
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:07,873
if you don't come
through on this--

854
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,675
I hate to interrupt
your "Breakfast Club" moment,

855
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,809
but you need to sober up.

856
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,544
- Donna, what is it?
- According to Benjamin,

857
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,346
the partners
didn't just leave.

858
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,915
They're coming after
every client we have.

859
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,567
All right,
give me an update

860
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:25,069
and give it to me
in plain English.

861
00:35:25,104 --> 00:35:26,437
I was able to shut
the hack down,

862
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:28,172
but not before they got all
three of your clients' files.

863
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:29,874
Shit, they're trying to put us
in the ground tonight.

864
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,342
Then we have to stop it
before it even gets started.

865
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:32,443
Well, the only problem
with that

866
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,677
is that we don't know
what bullshit story

867
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:35,113
they're out there
selling right now.

868
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:37,281
Then we need to figure it out.
We need to figure it out fast.

869
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:39,350
[telephone ringing]
It's the main line.

870
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:40,951
What should we do?

871
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:42,553
Donna.

872
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:48,526
Pearson Specter Litt,
may I help you?

873
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:51,061
One moment, please.

874
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,663
It's for you.
It's Jim Reynolds.

875
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:54,298
That's Decker Pharmaceutical.
Don't take it. He's leaving us.

876
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,900
Louis,
he's my oldest client.

877
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,234
I'm not ducking his call.

878
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,104
- Jessica.
- Put him on speaker.

879
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,405
Jim, how can I help you?

880
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,474
<i>You can tell me</i>
<i>what's going on there.</i>

881
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,109
<i>I've been hearing</i>
<i>a lot of rumors,</i>

882
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:08,279
<i>and I need to hear</i>
<i>the truth from you.</i>

883
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:10,915
All right, Jim,
you want to hear the truth?

884
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,484
We went out for the afternoon,
and when we got back,

885
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,452
every partner
in the place was gone.

886
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,987
But I'm telling you,

887
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:18,822
the name partners
are still here,

888
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:21,992
and we can still service you
and the board.

889
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:23,494
<i>I know you can.</i>

890
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:25,829
Then you're not calling to say
that you're leaving us?

891
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:27,965
<i>I was calling to tell you</i>
<i>I've been sent notice.</i>

892
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,366
<i>They're bifurcating your firm,</i>

893
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,101
<i>and the other partners</i>
<i>have nothing to do</i>

894
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,937
<i>with Pearson Specter Litt</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

895
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:35,172
Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it,
and I won't forget it.

896
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:36,941
<i>Jessica, if you're not back</i>
<i>on your feet</i>

897
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,309
<i>by the end of the month,</i>

898
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:39,977
<i>I won't be able</i>
<i>to hold off the board.</i>

899
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,478
If we're not back
by the end of the month,

900
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:44,615
I will call the board
and resign from service myself.

901
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:47,985
Isn't this good?
They're not trying to poach.

902
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,420
- It's just as bad.
- What do you mean?

903
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,789
It means they don't care
about clients right now.

904
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:52,957
They're bifurcating the firm

905
00:36:52,992 --> 00:36:54,758
because they want
their buy-ins back.

906
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:56,460
And they hacked us to get
our clients' information

907
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:58,028
so that they could
deliver notice.

908
00:36:58,064 --> 00:36:59,930
We need to move the money
that we have

909
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,265
in every account by tomorrow.

910
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,168
We don't need to move it.
We need to use it.

911
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:06,637
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

912
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:08,339
you're a genius.

913
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:10,140
What are you talking about?

914
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,308
We can use their buy-ins

915
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:12,943
to settle
the class-action lawsuits.

916
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:14,912
And they won't be able
to sue us for the money back

917
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:17,047
because it'll already
be gone.

918
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,217
You really are a genius.

919
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:22,353
Thanks, Harvey.

920
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:24,321
Uh, might I point out
that I was the one

921
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:25,856
that brought the hacking
to your attention

922
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:28,125
in the first place, so...

923
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:37,568
You might as well tell me
what's on your mind.

924
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,670
I can hear you
staring at the wall

925
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:41,839
from all the way over here.

926
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:44,375
How do you handle it...

927
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:49,113
Being away from Jennifer
for so long?

928
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:53,484

Well, now that
we're starting fresh,

00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:36,794
can we please finally get rid
of that hideous duck painting?

941
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:39,496
- No, Louis, we can't.
- Why not?

Because it's like you.

where's Gretchen?

I can't believe
she would walk out on us too.

She didn't. We were supposed
to be at the wedding,

947
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,875
so I gave her the day off
to go to the orthodontist.

Tomorrow morning,
we offer them

ten cents on the dollar
to settle these suits.

953

And from this point on,

we are all committing
to giving this firm

It says

What did she say?

She says she got your text,
she misses you,

What the hell are you
talking about?

Only thing I told you
tonight that's true

987
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,539
is that you shouldn't
trust people in here.

do that to me?

You said you could've turned

I could get back at him
