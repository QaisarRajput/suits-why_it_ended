1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:01,832
<i>Previously on Suits...</i>

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:02,916
This is a copy of the letter

3
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,166
you wrote a copy
to the district attorney

4
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,791
when you threatened expose me.

5
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,374
You ever do send that letter,
you're in the same boat as me.

6
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,583
You want to move in here?

7
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:12,458
I've only ever been here twice,

8
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,625
and both times were with you.

9
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,458
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,707
you get your name on the door.

11
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:18,625
If you think you're gonna win
this time,

12
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,000
you've got another thing
coming.

13
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,500
You ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

14
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,917
to get her father to turn?

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,708
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

16
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,792
Folsom Foods.
This is about Harvey Specter,

17
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,417
Jessica Pearson,
and their divorce negotiations,

18
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,833
and you don't go to the one
you didn't marry

19
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,167
to stick it to the one you did.

20
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,457
It's a check from Folsom Foods.

21
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,125
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

22
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,417
If you crush me,
I'll have nothing.

23
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
He was bullying me.

24
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,292
So you used me
to bully him back.

25
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,250
If you don't want
to live with me,

26
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,414
why don't you just tell me?

27
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,833
I just need some time.

28
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,000
- Hessington Oil just fired us.
- Scottie betrayed me.

29
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,875
I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

30
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,500
Something dropped from the sky,

31
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,792
tilted everything in your favor
right after I cut you a break?

32
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,542
I am not going to dissolve
this merger.

33
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,583
You already signed
the agreement.

34
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,042
Then sue me.

35
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,250
Scottie didn't get us fired.
Ava Hessington did.

36
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,083
She's suing all of us.

37
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,125
I got into Stanford.

38
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,167
You have something
to say to me?

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,333
I'm sorry, Scottie.

40
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,417
I didn't believe you,
but you were telling the truth.

41
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,625
Why does it always
have to be so...

42
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,208
- I said I was sorry.
- You didn't mean it.

43
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,625
I meant it.

44
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,458
But just because I was wrong
about you betraying me

45
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,750
doesn't mean I was wrong
to think you might have done it.

46
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,375
See, this is what I mean,
Harvey.

47
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,958
If you thought anything of me,
you'd know I'd never do that.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,375
I do think something of you,

49
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,542
which is why I'm going to
tell you this: Get out.

50
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,833
Honor the dissolution agreement
and move on.

51
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,625
You've got to be kidding me.

52
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,625
You want me to put
all the liability on Edward?

53
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,333
The liability
belongs on Edward.

54
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,000
So when you say that you think
something of me,

55
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,667
what you actually mean is
you want me to help you

56
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,250
to bail on Darby International.

57
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,792
Scottie,
when this lawsuit's over,

58
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,083
there's not going to be
a Darby International.

59
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,750
- You don't know that.
- What I know is

60
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,458
you have a chance
to get another job

61
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,167
before everything hits the fan.
You won't in another week.

62
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,049
I won't need another job
when I right the ship.

63
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,000
You're not going to right
the ship.

64
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,833
If you were on that jury,
the only question you'd ask

65
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,875
is how many zeroes
to put on the check.

66
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,500
You want me to turn my back
on the man

67
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,042
that I've been in the foxhole
with for the last ten years.

68
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,750
Would you do the same?

69
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,958
If that man turned out
to have sanctioned murder

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,958
without my knowledge and let me
take the hit, I would.

71
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,708
Hmm.

72
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:46,875
Well... like it or not,
you're in the foxhole with me.

73
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,750
So order a glass
of your Macallan 20-pretentious,

74
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,792
and let's figure out how we're
going to fight this together.

75
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,750
You haven't said a word
all night.

76
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,208
Are we going to talk
about this or not?

77
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,750
What is there to talk about?

78
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,292
This is why you didn't want
to decide

79
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,167
whether to live with me
or not, right?

80
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,792
Well, it isn't, actually,

81
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,917
but you knew that I was
applying to Stanford,

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,750
and you said that you'd support
whatever decision I made.

83
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,625
I did, but then
you got into Columbia,

84
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,125
so I thought
that wouldn't matter anymore.

85
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,750
Because Stanford's
in California,

86
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,917
and Columbia's here.
And because Columbia

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,292
is an amazing school
and we said we love each other.

88
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,917
Yeah, but it's not that simple.

89
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,958
It sounds that simple to me.

90
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,792
[Stutters] What I mean is

91
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,667
I'm not built the same as you.

92
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,083
I need to decide
what school is better for me

93
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,750
before factoring in you or us
or anything else.

94
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,292
And how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

95
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,415
The same way that I make
all the important decisions

96
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,875
in my life,
by weighing the pros and cons

97
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,375
of both schools.

98
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,750
And where does not being
with me rank on that list?

99
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,458
You're missing the point.

100
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,622
I am trying to figure out
which school is best for me

101
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,542
in a vacuum.
No, you're missing the point.

102
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,625
You're trying to figure out
what school is best for you

103
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,542
as though I didn't exist,
but I do.

104
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,375
- Mike...
- Rachel, I'm not saying

105
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,833
that you have to
go to Columbia.

106
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:09,417
We're adults. We're together.

107
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,292
At some point, you're going to
have to factor that in too.

108
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,625
[Door closes]

109
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,375
- She go for it?
- No, she didn't.

110
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,458
Then if Scottie won't
separate from us amicably,

111
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,875
we'll make her do it forcibly.

112
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,833
Jessica, I don't want to start
another war with her.

113
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,375
- Then what's your idea?
- My idea is

114
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,750
we act like lawyers
and we fight the lawsuit.

115
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,667
On its merits?

116
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,917
Edward Darby sanctioned murder.
We don't stand a chance.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,250
- Jessica...
- Harvey, you know I'm right,

118
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,458
and it's what you told
Scottie...

119
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,958
it's the truth, and just because
she can't see it

120
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,042
doesn't mean
we have to live with it.

121
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,292
No, we don't.

122
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,832
I need you to get in a room
with Ava

123
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,917
and offer our testimony
against Edward

124
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,917
in exchange for taking our names
off the lawsuit.

125
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:53,417
What about when Scottie
finds out?

126
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,208
Thanks.

127
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,958
11:08.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,042
You know I could have you sanctioned
for being late to a settlement conference.

129
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,208
Tanner, what the hell are you
doing here, and how the hell

130
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,375
did you insinuate yourself
with Ava Hessington?

131
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,208
- Jealous?
- No, I just thought Hessington

132
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,125
was in the oil business,
not the snake oil business.

133
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,750
Ha ha. They diversified.

134
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,792
- Where's Ava?
- Ava's not here,

135
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,473
because she's not interested
in your offer

136
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,042
to testify
against Edward Darby.

137
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm not the one
who did this to her.

138
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,708
Aren't you? Didn't you pull
your typical bullshit

139
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,458
to get the original attorney
thrown off this case?

140
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,662
- To win the damn case.
- Well, instead of winning it,

141
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,042
it led to Ava being charged
with murder.

142
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
A charge I got her off of

143
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,583
by finding the people
who were actually responsible.

144
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,125
Sorry, Harv,
but that's not enough,

145
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,583
and Ava has no intention
of letting you off the hook.

146
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,958
Ava or you?

147
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,792
We both know
you tracked her down

148
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,917
because of your lifelong,
never-gonna-happen dream

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,292
to beat me. I never heard

150
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,208
of Ava Hessington until
she walked through my door.

151
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,208
Bullshit.
You have a subscription

152
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,083
to Harvey Specter monthly,
and I know it.

153
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,000
[Laughing] Okay, you got me.

154
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,250
I knew exactly who she was

155
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,894
the second she walked
through my door...

156
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,917
my chance to take

Van Giessen thinks Schwarz
got too cozy with Boone.

309
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,417
- Tax law Boone?
- Bankruptcy Boone.

310
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,625
- I thought she was gay.
- No, she's not.

311
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,833
[Laughs] What?
I knew you'd know.

312
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:00,250
- I always do.
- [Laughs]

313
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,875
How long have Mike Ross
and Rachel Zane been dating?

314
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,792
Um, a few months.

315
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,167
- So it's not casual?
- No, it's not.

316
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,890
Which means
he told Robert Zane's daughter

317
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,125
his secret.

318
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,458
Jessica, I know
what you're thinking...

319
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,917
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,250
But for now, I'm thinking
that you're not going to say

321
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,708
anything about this
to either one of them.

322
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,417
And that's not a request.

323
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,875
I won't say a word.

324
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,399
Jesus, you look like shit.

325
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,525
I was up all night.
I couldn't sleep.

326
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,608
I told you I didn't need
anything on Tanner yet.

327
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,483
I'm not here to talk
about Tanner

328
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,983
or the lawsuit or the merger,
I just...

329
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,942
I want to know how you do it.

330
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,483
How I do what?

331
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,025
Not let people in.

332
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,775
I need to know.

333
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,733
You don't know
what I do and don't do.

334
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,777
What I know is that
you seem to have relationships

335
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,900
again and again
and they don't eat you up

336
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:03,775
or spit you out
or seem to affect you at all.

337
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,567
I have a picture of Dorian Gray

338
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,317
hanging in my closet.
It's not funny.

339
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,067
I wasn't joking.
I was trying to get you to leave

340
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,900
so I could have my morning
without you judging me.

341
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,692
Harvey,
I'm not judging you, all right?

342
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:15,525
I'm just... I just need to know
what your mind-set is.

343
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,108
My mind-set is,
I don't talk about it.

344
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,733
I don't want to talk about it.

345
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,483
I keep my personal here
and my business over there.

346
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,983
I'm happy
that's working for you,

347
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,983
but it doesn't seem
to be working for me.

348
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:32,192
I wasn't giving you advice.
I was answering your question.

349
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,775
You want advice, call Dr. Phil.

350
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:36,358
Harvey, I'm not trying
to attack you here, okay?

351
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,150
I'm struggling with something.
I just...

352
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:39,650
I'm trying to get
your take on it.

353
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,317
And I'm not trying to be
defensive, I'm just telling you

354
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,275
I don't know everything
about everything.

355
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,775
Look Mike, you want to know
how to be a lawyer,

356
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,525
I'm your man.

357
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,233
You want to know
how to deal with love,

358
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,650
[chuckles] That's not my area.

359
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,233
There's coffee made
and bagels in the fridge.

360
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,608
Why don't you
take the morning off?

361
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,650
I've got the deposition.
I got to go.

362
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:10,650
What the hell happened?

363
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,858
Brian Galloway's weighing offers
from seven different firms.

364
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,733
Eight if you count yours.

365
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,442
Why would you do that to me?

366
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,900
Is this about
the Mastodon exhibit?

367
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,733
No, you're committed
to your work

368
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,442
as I'm committed to mine,
and unless I'm mistaken,

369
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:26,442
we never made a professional
commitment to each other.

370
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,942
Sheila,
I don't need a commitment

371
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,733
to know that what we have
is special and unique.

372
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:33,608
It's not special,
and it's definitely not unique.

373
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,483
Okay, well, then I'm going to
ask you a question,

374
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,358
and I'm only
going to ask it once.

375
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,358
Do you war room
with other firms?

376
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,983
You're a lawyer, Louis.

377
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,650
Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.
I don't know who you are.

378
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:49,650
I'm sorry you feel that way,

379
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,775
but if you can't handle me
seeing other firms,

380
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,358
then maybe you're not the man
that I thought you were,

381
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,608
and maybe you don't deserve
Brian Galloway.

382
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,150
Deserve him?

383
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,650
You don't get to make
that determination.

384
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,692
Yes, I do.
I'm Sheila Amanda Sazs,

385
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,025
and if I say
you don't deserve him,

386
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:08,817
you don't get to have him.
I don't care who you are.

387
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,442
If I want him, I can have him,

388
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,817
and I'm going to take him
six ways from Sunday

389
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,067
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

390
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,358
Yes, there is,

391
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,150
because when I'm done
talking to him,

392
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,983
there's no way on earth he'll
end up at Pearson Darby Specter

393
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,192
or whatever bullshit name

394
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,400
you guys are calling yourselves
this week.

395
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,525
Now, get out of my way.
I have a plane to catch.

396
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,525
- You're early.
- So are you.

397
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,275
I should have known
something like this was coming

398
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,717
when you left
without saying a word.

399
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,858
What did you expect,
a fruit basket

400
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,358
for getting me out of a crime
your firm committed?

401
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,275
Ava, I know Travis Tanner
fed you a line

402
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,483
to get your business, but...

403
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,608
Mr. Tanner
didn't feed me anything.

404
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,608
This is the result
of your actions.

405
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,942
Wait a second,
you really did go to him?

406
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:58,192
I looked into you
when I was deciding to hire you.

407
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,817
You think I wouldn't do
the same thing again

408
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,608
when I decided
to come after you?

409
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,233
When you looked into me,

410
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:04,650
you found out
that whatever I do

411
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,317
I do it to win, and that's all
I ever did for you.

412
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,025
What you did
was intimidate people

413
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,358
and what it did
was backfire onto me.

414
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,525
Well, now I've found someone
you can't intimidate,

415
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,608
and it's backfiring onto you.

416
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,358
Now, if you'll excuse me,

417
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,775
I don't need to be here
for this.

418
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:23,442
So you came here
just to vent at me?

419
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,483
I came here to see
if you were at all sorry

420
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,525
about the way
you handled my case.

421
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,900
I see that you aren't.
Though I imagine you will be

422
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,942
once Mr. Tanner
gets through with you.

423
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,442
Feels like old times.

424
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,275
Lot of good memories
in this room.

425
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,317
Bring back the taste of blood
in your mouth?

426
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,417
Oh, I'm a shark, Harvey.
I love the taste of blood.

427
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:49,642
Speaking of which,

428
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,475
when you accepted this case,
did you make a side deal

429
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,475
with Edward Darby
where he agreed to make you

430
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:57,350
managing partner
over Jessica Pearson if you won?

431
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,808
Yes, I did,

432
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,683
but that isn't a side deal.
That's an incentive.

433
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,558
What it is
is a conflict of interest.

434
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,933
That is not true.

435
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,897
If anything, it made Harvey
work harder for Ava.

436
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,600
Whatever gets you
through the night.

437
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:10,725
The truth is, Edward Darby
doesn't make that deal

438
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,642
unless you have leverage.
You knew Darby couldn't lose

439
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,517
because Stephen Huntley's
murders would be discovered.

440
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,267
Isn't that correct?
No, it isn't.

441
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,017
So prior to her trial
starting, you didn't know

442
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,980
that Stephen Huntley
orchestrated those murders?

443
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,600
- No, I didn't.
- What if I told you

444
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,017
I have evidence that you did?
I'd say you're full of shit.

445
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,350
And whether he knew or not
is irrelevant,

446
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,892
since Edward Darby
stipulated that he knew,

447
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,933
making Mr. Specter liable
anyway.

448
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,433
Oh, it's relevant,

449
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,808
because two days ago,
Mr. Specter tried to cut a deal

450
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:39,100
to split off from Edward Darby
behind your back.

451
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,683
Oh, I see.
Harvey didn't tell you.

452
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:42,808
If Harvey had told me,

453
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,392
it wouldn't be going
behind my back,

454
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,808
and I'm not going to blame him
for doing what's in his nature

455
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,892
any more than I'd blame you
for being an asshole.

456
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,600
Ooh. Feisty and hot.

457
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,350
Now I get why he can't
stay away from you.

458
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,433
Tanner, last time,
Harvey knocked you out.

459
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,725
You don't start acting
like a human being this time,

460
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,183
you're gonna have to deal
with me.

461
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,933
Hey, I'm not the one
who screwed my old girlfriend

462
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:03,933
while she was engaged.
Kind of a dick move, Harv.

463
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,017
That's enough.

464
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,600
Wait a second.

465
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,600
How come she jumped in,
and you didn't?

466
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:11,392
She didn't tell you
she was engaged.

467
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:12,933
Can't trust the hot ones.

468
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,892
Come after me, Tanner.
That's what you're here for.

469
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:19,392
Oh. I get it.
You actually care about her.

470
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,433
I think I've gotten
everything I need right now,

471
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,058
but since it was so much fun,
I'm going to go ahead

472
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,933
and reserve the right
to do this again.

473
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,142
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Of course.

474
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,767
Just wondering if maybe
you had a copy

475
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,142
of Harvey's deposition.

476
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,933
Can't you just
get one from Harvey?

477
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,933
I could, but then I wouldn't
be able to show you

478
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:55,892
how I'm letting you
have all your space.

479
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,933
- This is space?
- Yeah, I mean,

480
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,558
I'm all the way over here,

481
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,683
being all space-giving
and adorable.

482
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,858
As opposed to what
you really want to be doing,

483
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,433
which is looking
at my pros and cons list

484
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:13,642
for Columbia and Stanford.
No, it actually isn't.

485
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,517
That list is for you.

486
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,058
It's part of your process,
and I'm gonna respect it.

487
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,808
What changed your mind?

488
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,683
I went to see Harvey
this morning.

489
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,975
Harvey gave you advice?

490
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,642
No.

491
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:31,225
And yes.

492
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:35,557
I just realized that if I go
his way, I am gonna lose you.

493
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:40,058
But if I keep going mine,
I'm gonna push you away.

494
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:44,767
So make your decision,
and I'll give you your space.

495
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,267
Thank you.

496
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:51,350
You go to Stanford...
We'll beat the odds.

497
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,767
Son of a bitch.

498
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,600
I'm sorry you had to sit
through that personal attack.

499
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,058
Oh, you think
that's what I'm pissed about?

500
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:04,392
You tried to cut a deal
that would screw Edward

501
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:05,683
and me in process.

502
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:08,683
I tried to include you.
You said no.

503
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,287
Oh, you think
that makes it any better?

504
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:12,767
Scottie, all this is
is Tanner trying to get us

505
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:14,017
to fight among ourselves.

506
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:15,808
Well, he's doing
a damn good job of it.

507
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,350
You think he didn't say
some things in there

508
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,850
that got to me too?
Well, I'm not bringing them up,

509
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,933
because right now,
we need to stick together.

510
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:23,975
Sticking together
means telling the truth,

511
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,017
so tell me, whose idea was it
to cut that deal,

512
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,225
yours or Jessica's?
It was hers,

513
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,869
and I didn't want
to go behind your back

514
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:31,600
just like you didn't want
to go behind Darby's,

515
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:35,100
but I did because in the end,
I knew I didn't have a choice.

516
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:38,767
And neither do you,
you just haven't seen that yet.

517
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:49,391
- Mike, I need your help.
- Okay, what is it Louis?

518
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,475
I need to you convince
Brian Galloway to come here.

519
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,058
Who?

520
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:55,308
The top associate candidate
of this year's class.

521
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,267
Stick with me.
Oh, yeah, Brian Galloway.

522
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,225
<i>Harvard,
editor of the Law Review.</i>

523
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,183
Welcome to the conversation.
Please tell me you knew him.

524
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,892
- No, I didn't.
- Damn it!

525
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,100
Louis, he wasn't my year.

526
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:06,267
You've already got Katrina.
What's so important

527
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,642
about getting this guy
to come here?

528
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:10,225
Mike, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not about him.

529
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,517
It's about Sheila Sazs.
Oh, yeah?

530
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:13,392
What about it? I mean her.

531
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,142
[Scoffs] Mike, come on,
don't be coy with me.

532
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,558
Everyone in New York knows
about our torrid affair.

533
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:19,316
Yeah, of course. Torrid.

534
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,900
She had it all set up
for him to come here,

535
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,650
and out of the clear, blue sky,

536
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,067
she's no longer going to be
exclusive with us.

537
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,858
- There's nothing you did?
- No.

538
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,525
She asked me to take the day
off, I said no.

539
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,608
Next thing I knew she was saying
that our relationship

540
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,358
wasn't special and that
she was free to see other firms.

541
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,442
Okay, Louis, I'm sorry,
but is it possible

542
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,067
that this has nothing to do
with work

543
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,483
and what she's actually saying

544
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,025
is that she wants
to be exclusive with you?

545
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,483
Oh, Mike, you're so silly.
You know nothing about women.

546
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,108
If she wanted to be
exclusive with me,

547
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,900
she would just come right out
and say it.

548
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,817
Holy shit, it was staring
at me right in the face.

549
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,942
- Not necessarily.
- I've just been using her

550
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:53,525
for her candidates, I've just
been wham, bam, candidate ma'am.

551
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:54,942
- Okay.
- I mean, any woman

552
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,067
who's been repeatedly Litt up
would demand

553
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,441
exclusive dominion
over my body.

554
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,682
- Duh.
- Now, get out of my way.

555
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,013
I have a letter to compose.
I'm...

556
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:02,108
Not in your way.

557
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,983
- Hello, Scottie.
- Tanner.

558
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,817
What are you doing here?

559
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,024
Oh, I just came to bring you
a coffee in the morning.

560
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:10,905
After meeting you,
I'd say there's an 80% chance

561
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,317
there's a roofie in there.
[Chuckles] No roofie.

562
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,483
Just a skinny vanilla latte
with extra whip

563
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,733
and a shot of caramel.

564
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,650
You looked up
my favorite drink?

565
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,317
It's all part of the package.

566
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,775
You're here
to split me off from Harvey?

567
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,442
Well, he did the same to you.

568
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,567
And you wouldn't even know
about it if it weren't for me.

569
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,358
You're a regular Mother Teresa.

570
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,650
Look, I just came to tell you
that we can take it easy on you

571
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:34,525
if you'll just maybe say
that Harvey

572
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,483
knew about Stephen Huntley
two months ago.

573
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,983
That would be a lie.

574
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,733
Maybe it would just be
conjecture presented as fact.

575
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:43,733
Look, I'm gonna say
because you already know it.

576
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:45,608
I betrayed Harvey once.

577
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,192
It's never going to happen
again.

578
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:49,817
Okay, well,
then I'll just have to hear

579
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,567
your side of the story
at your deposition.

580
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,317
Ms. Scott, to your knowledge,

581
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,400
did Harvey Specter
want this merger?

582
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,025
- No, he didn't.
- And did you try

583
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:02,067
to force it on him
because you'd lost to him

584
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,067
numerous times and you wanted
to get him back?

585
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,150
You're the only one
who's trying to get Harvey back

586
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,400
for losing, Tanner.

587
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,942
And I'm about to be successful.

588
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:11,150
Isn't it true
that while you were engaged,

589
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,608
you came to New York
and slept with Harvey Specter

590
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:15,733
in an attempt to get him
to tell you he loved you

591
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:16,858
and he said no?

592
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,525
That is utter conjecture.

593
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,007
That's why we have
these depositions,

594
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,317
so I can ask questions
about things I'm conjecturing.

595
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,608
You're not asking questions.
You're throwing mud.

596
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:26,442
Am I? The facts are,

597
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,567
you had a relationship with him
in law school,

598
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:29,858
you worked a case against him,

599
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,442
and shortly thereafter,
ended your relationship.

600
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,817
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to connect the dots.

601
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,275
- Tanner...
- Did you really think

602
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,983
that you could domesticate him?
A house in Westchester,

603
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,358
Harvey flipping burgers
on the weekends?

604
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,942
What kind of fantasy land
were you living in?

605
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,317
Tanner, that's enough.

606
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,692
She's not answering
this line of questioning.

607
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,942
Then I'll answer it for her.

608
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:49,317
You loved him, he spurned you,

609
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,983
and you set this whole thing up
to get him back.

610
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,150
That's insane.

611
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,483
Which part? That you loved him?

612
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:58,067

I was not the only one
that Edward Darby relied on.

621
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,900
He relied on Stephen Huntley
for what happened in the E.I.R.,

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,442
Donna told me that Stephen's
affidavit is dead.

770
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,692
It is, but it doesn't matter,
because Tanner's

771
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:46,150
gonna keep coming after you
unless we sign this.

772
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:48,858
You'll never sign this.

773
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,858
Scottie,
you may not believe this,

774
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,692
but if the decision were mine,
I would.

775
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,317
Jessica...
she wouldn't even consider it.

776
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:57,817
I should have known.

777
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,275
This is about you getting me
to split you off from Edward

778
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,192
so you can convince Ava
to stop coming after you.

779
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,900
- This isn't about that.
- Then what is it about?

780
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,442
I can't stand to see them
come after you.

781
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:08,775
- Bullshit!
- It's not bullshit.

782
00:33:08,858 --> 00:33:10,025
You think I can't take it!

783
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,858
Look, you're not listening
to me, okay?

784
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:14,442
I can't take it!

785
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,275
Scottie, Tanner can only
come after you

786
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:19,233
if Ava lets him come after you,

787
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:21,566
and Ava's only letting him
come after you to get to me.

788
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,233
Take off the shackles off
and let me convince her

789
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:25,483
this fight isn't with me,
it's with Edward.

790
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,650
Okay, Harvey.

791
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:30,150
Okay, you win.

792
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:35,733
Shackles are off.

793
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,733
[Knocking at the door]

794
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,400
- Hi.
- Hey.

795
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:44,858
There's something that I need
to tell you, and...

796
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,692
I really don't want to.

797
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:51,108
Okay. [Chuckles]
You're scaring me.

798
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,442
Jessica came by my place
this morning.

799
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,567
- She knows about us.
- She does.

800
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,150
Okay.

801
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,953
She says that you're
Robert Zane's daughter,

802
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:03,858
and if you want
to stay at the firm...

803
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,733
You need to sign an affidavit.

804
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:10,317
Saying what?

805
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
That you know I'm a fraud.

806
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:18,483
Well, what if I don't sign it?

807
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,900
Then she'll fire me.

808
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:24,233
I don't believe that.
You've got leverage.

809
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:27,100
No, that just stops her
from exposing me, not firing me.

810
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:28,717
- Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit.

811
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,842
If she fires me, what am I
gonna to do, run to the D.A.?

812
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:34,217
Have them throw me in jail
just to get her back?

813
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,633
I'm not going to do that,
and she knows it.

814
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:50,300
Can't stand that I put you
in this position.

815
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:53,342
And the only way I can see
out of this is...

816
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,800
for you to go to Stanford.

817
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,300
Miss Hessington, when we first met

818
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,092
did you admit
you bribed a foreign government

819
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:05,217
to get your pipeline?

820
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,842
I pled guilty.

821
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,300
I didn't ask you what you pled.

822
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:11,550
I asked if you did it.
That's privileged.

823
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,967
Your client forfeited
privilege when she sued me.

824
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,217
Keep that in mind.

825
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:16,425
My client's not suing you.

826
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,258
She's suing
Pearson Darby Specter.

827
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:21,133
There is no
Pearson Darby Specter.

828
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,758
We split. [Chuckles]

829
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
Edward Darby
wouldn't allow that.

830
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,300
Edward Darby doesn't have
the power to stop it.

831
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,842
But I do, and I'm not going to
let you make them suffer

832
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,550
for what Darby did.
Hell of a performance, Harvey.

833
00:35:31,592 --> 00:35:33,050
Back-up singers and everything.

834
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,373
It's still not
going to stop us.

835
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,800
And he isn't
making them suffer.

836
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:38,550
I am for what he did to me.

837
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:41,467
Did what to you?
Get you a slap on the wrist

838
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,717
for your original
bribery charges,

839
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,758
get you off murder,

840
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,467
or stop you
from bribing witnesses?

841
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,342
Which brings me
to my next question.

842
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:50,675
Did you fire me
for refusing to bribe witnesses

843
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:52,092
on your behalf?

844
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,467
- You're under oath.
- Don't answer that.

845
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,383
I wouldn't.
It's a federal crime.

846
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,425
She doesn't have to.
Like I said,

847
00:35:58,508 --> 00:36:01,550
we're not bound by privilege
and I've got three witnesses,

848
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,133
including your friend
Stephen Huntley

849
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:05,425
who testified to it
in open court.

850
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:08,633
You want to throw stones, Ava?
We've got some rocks of our own.

851
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,217
What are you doing, Harvey?

852
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,217
I'm talking to your client
off the record.

853
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:21,133
No, no, no.
On the record, or not at all.

854
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:22,425
No, let him speak.

855
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:26,467
I want to hear
what he's got to say.

856
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,758
Ava, you can come at us
and we can come at you.

857
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:35,092
I don't want that.

858
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,425
You wanted to know if I'm sorry.
I am.

859
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,758
I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you,

860
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,550
I'm sorry I didn't believe you,

861
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,258
I am sorry that my history
with Cameron

862
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:47,883
put a target on your back,

863
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,967
but I am not sorry that I did
everything in my power

864
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,050
to help you every chance I got.

865
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:55,300
If you don't believe that,
then keep coming.

866
00:36:55,383 --> 00:37:00,258
But if you do, I'm asking,
put your anger where it belongs.

867
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:12,258
Tanner, I hope you still have
that quarter I gave you,

868
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:14,925
'cause I think it's time
to call your mom.

869
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:18,092
Harvey.

870
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:21,717
Fantastic.

871
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:36,050
I hear we won.

872
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,842
We hit a single. Just kidding.

873
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,842
We knocked the son of a bitch
out of the park.

874
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,092
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you.

875
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,633
I hear you're representing
Stephen Huntley now.

876
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:47,967
Yeah. Might as well be.

877
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,633
What's that supposed to mean?

878
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,092
It means we sat and had drinks
when we thought Ava was guilty.

879
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,467
Now Stephen is.
What's the difference?

880
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:56,675
Guess your morning off
didn't do the trick.

881
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:59,092
What are we doing here, Harvey?

882
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,092
We spend every minute
of our lives in this office

883
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:04,175
fighting with each other
over meaningless shit

884
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,800
for clients
that we don't even know,

885
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,550
and then when some
real connection comes along,

886
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,258
just some little piece
of happiness...

887
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,217
Mike.

888
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,425
I'm sorry.

889
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,925
Did she tell you what she did?

890
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,217
Rachel?

891
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,050
I guess not.

892
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,883
Jessica's basically forcing her
to go to Stanford

893
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,758
instead of Columbia.

894
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,717
She found out about you two.

895
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,842
I don't want her to go.

896
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,800
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

897
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,050
Come in.

898
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:10,717
I want to talk to you about...
This.

899
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,592
I see you haven't signed it.

900
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,800
No, I haven't.

901
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:18,008
Then you must want something,
because you wouldn't be here

902
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,758
just to tell me
you weren't going to sign it.

903
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,842
Mike said you were worried
that Robert Zane's daughter

904
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:25,675
knew his secret, which got me
thinking about my father

905
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:27,633
and something he's always said.

906
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:29,383
- Which is?
- Don't sign anything

907
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,425
unless you can get something
in return.

908
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:34,217
- It's called consideration.
- I know what it's called.

909
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:41,258
What do you want?

910
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:44,425
You want me to guarantee
that I won't do something

911
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,133
that I would never do.

912
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,417
I want you to guarantee
that you will do something

913
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,667
that you thought you would
never do but should do.

914
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,833
I can't wait to hear this.

915
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:55,125
Waive the Harvard rule for me.

916
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,542
- You're not even a lawyer.
- But I will be,

917
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,833
and when I am,
I want to work here.

918
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,583
The Harvard rule

919
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,667
is the longest-standing rule
we have.

920
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,625
I have been killing it here
for the better part of a decade.

921
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,958
I'm better than most of
the associates in that bullpen

922
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,333
and I haven't even
gone to law school yet,

923
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:15,000
so imagine what it'll be like
once I have.

924
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,625
You are your father's daughter.

925
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,542
Yes, I am.

926
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,208
But I don't want to work
for him.

927
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:24,250
I want to work for you.

928
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,583
[Both laughing]

929
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,292
To kicking Travis Tanner's ass.

930
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:35,667
You got that right. [Laughs]

931
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,792
Mmm. A pretty great meal.

932
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,958
Couldn't have done it
without you.

933
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,542
I know, I taught you
how to make it.

934
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,417
Right after we crushed the bar.

935
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,542
[Chuckles] I also remember
what happened later that night.

936
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:54,625
It was a pretty great night.

937
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,625
Harvey.

938
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,817
Why am I here?

939
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:04,925
Well, I haven't cooked
anyone dinner for a while,

940
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,883
and I thought you deserved it.
I did,

941
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,592
but you've made it clear
that you don't want more,

942
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,800
and I don't want to go back
to the way it was, so...

943
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,800
I want to work with you.

944
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:18,800
What?

945
00:41:18,883 --> 00:41:21,508
You've been associated
with the name Darby too long.

946
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:22,800
I can help you.

947
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,508
I don't need your help.
I'll be fine.

948
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:26,717
No, you won't,
and all that stuff about Tanner

949
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:28,883
coming after you and me
not being able to take it,

950
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:31,133
it was true. I care about you.

951
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:34,883
Come to Pearson Specter.
I know that you care about me.

952
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,550
You have made that very clear,

953
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:37,967
but I am not interested

954
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,757
in working with someone
day in and day out

955
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:43,008
where all they can manage to say
is, "I care about you."

956
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:44,508
- Is that all I've ever said?
- Actually, yes,

957
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,508
over and over again,
"I care about you."

958
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,383
Just what every girl
wants to hear.

959
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,925
- Scottie, that's...
- No, no, no.

960
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:58,697
If all you want to do
is work with me,

961
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,383
I can find a job
somewhere else.

962
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,425
It's the best I...

963
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:06,258
Sorry, I should just go.
I don't...

964
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:11,633
Scottie, that's not all I want.

965
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:15,050
Then say it.

966
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,467
I want you in my life.

967
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:27,675
- Hi.
- Hi.

968
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,467
Thought you didn't like
coming down here.

969
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,467
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

970
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,717
I finished my list.

971
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:49,217
And?

972
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,633
Stanford.

973
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:56,092
It's the better fit.

974
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,592
Rachel, look...

975
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:06,383
I don't need a list to tell me

976
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,383
that I don't want to be
without you.

977
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,175
You're staying?

978
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,217
Just try and stop me.

979
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,667
- You were messing with me.
- [Laughs]

980
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:23,833
- You got me.
- I got...

981
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,083
You! You got me!

982
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:28,167
[Both giggling]

983
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,208
How did you find me?

984
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:45,125
You're like me,
a gladiator of your profession,

985
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,750
and... This is your arena.

986
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:58,375
This place has every
Harvard law student file ever.

987
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,833
It's like home for me.

988
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:05,417
And... It's where
you wanted me to say...

989
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,917
Sheila Amanda Sazs,
I want to be exclusive with you.

990
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,750
And I want to be exclusive
with you.

991
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,250
Yes.

992
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,792
Yes.

993
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,625
A thousand times yes.

994
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,833
We're gonna make love.
And eat this picnic.

995
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,500
In no particular order.

996
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,708
Wait.
First, I'm gonna call my mother.

997
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,959
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

998
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,250
To tell her the good news?

999
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,292
To tell her
you stopped being a pussy.

1000
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:42,792
Do not touch
any of the files in here.

1001
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,500
- Will you smack me if I do?
- Louis,

1002
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,667
this is not a joke.

1003
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:49,625
You're not even
supposed to be in here.

1004
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,450
For the love of God,
forgive me, Sheila.

1005
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,242
You gotta be kidding me.

1006
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:19,658
Harvey Specter. [Laughs]

1007
00:45:19,742 --> 00:45:21,700
What a douche.

1008
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:23,783
Mike Ross.

1009
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,158
R-o, r-o, r-o. "R-o."

1010
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:38,908
"Richardson...
James Ross"...

1011
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:42,033
Matthew Ross.
What the hell? Mike Ross!

1012
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:49,033
He's not here.
