I get to choose whatever I want,

177
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,681
Except for the one thing
I really want.

178
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,882
- Maybe I should have been
more clear.

179
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,050
- Maybe you should have.

180
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,187
I mean, you're a goddamn lawyer,
after all.

181
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,621
- Louis,

182
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,892
Then let me be clear right now.

183
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,562
I am giving you an opportunity

184
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:47,699
To accept a well-deserved
thank-you with grace.

185
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,701
You can either take it,

186
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,870
Or you can turn it
into a personal snub

187
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,573
And ruin all the goodwill

188
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:59,544
That you've just earned
with me and harvey.

189
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,680
The choice is yours.

190
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,151
- Can I get back to you on that?
- I'm sorry. What?

191
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,753
- Can I get back to you on that?

192
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,856
- That's all I can hope for,
louis.

193
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,228
- Hey.

194
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,563
So I just wanted
to run through your schedule

195
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,598
For the rest of the week.

196
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,665
- Mm, go ahead.

197
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,801
- You've got ellis
at 4:00 today,

198
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,669
Mckinney at 10:00 tomorrow,

199
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:29,007
And when should I pencil you in
to go see mike?

200
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,543
- See him for what?
- To be a friend.

201
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,011
- Donna,
as far as he's concerned,

202
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,813
I sold him out
to win the takeover.

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,748
I am the last person
he wants to see right now.

204
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,983
- And I would agree
with all that,

205
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,785
Except for the fact
that mike got fired.

206
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,687
- What?

207
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,055
When?
- Last night.

208
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,558
Because you should be
hearing it from him,

209
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,194
And they would rather be
alone and miserable

210
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,595
Than ever run the risk
of being accused

211
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,830
Of needing someone.

212
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,064
- He has rachel.

213
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,199
- Who is the one person
mike believes

214
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,934
Will stand by him
no matter what,

215
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,069
Which makes her the one person
he won't believe

216
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,772
When she says
he didn't completely fail.

217
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,208
- How important
is the meeting with ellis?

218
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,576
- He says it's urgent.

219
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,178
- Tell him I have to reschedule.

220
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,261
- Rachel or donna?

221
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,996
Who told you to check up on me?

222
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,231
- You don't think
I'd do that on my own?

223
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,299
- No, I don't.

224
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,700
- Well, I wouldn't have

225
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,068
Because I didn't think
you'd need it.

226
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,204
Then I found out you got fired.

227
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,942
People lose their jobs
every single day.

228
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,944
- Yeah, not people like you.

229
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,145
Something's going on.

230
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,179
Why'd you get fired?

231
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,280
- You mean other than the fact

232
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,949
That I picked a fight
I couldn't win?

233
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,317
- I don't care
how it turned out.

234
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,852
You went 15 rounds
on your first shot.

235
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,189
No way jonathan sidwell
lets you go after that.

236
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,027
It was forstman, wasn't it?

237
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,830
- I only got his money
if I agreed to cut sidwell

238
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,865
Out of the deal.

239
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,300
- And sidwell found out.

240
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,002
- He didn't just find out.

241
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,972
- [scoffs]
that son of a bitch.

242
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,241
That son of a bitch
has offered me a job.

243
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,844
- Mike, you can't do it,
and you know it.

244
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,946
- What choice do I have?

245
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,781
I was an investment banker
for ten minutes,

246
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,950
And I blew the only deal
I'm ever gonna get near.

247
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,252
- Well, that sounds exactly
like the kind of bullsh--

248
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,722
Forstman tells people
to wrap them around his finger.

249
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,256
- Doesn't mean it's not true.
- Yes, it does.

250
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,926
I could get you
five interviews before tomorrow.

251
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,094
- And how are you going
to do that?

252
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,129
- By making
five goddamn phone calls.

253
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,198
- And what are you gonna say
when they answer?

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,001
I was a harvard-educated lawyer
working for you?

255
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,771
I might as well go back
to being a fraud.

256
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,906
[sighs]

257
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,709
- What if I can get jessica
to take you back?

258
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,012
- [chuckles]

259
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,980
What if you could bring
my parents back to life?

260
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,050
Have about the same chance
of happening.

261
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,952
- Mike, I'm trying to help you.
- And I appreciate that.

262
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,720
But I only have two references,
harvey,

263
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,389
You, who has to lie for me,

264
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,990
And jonathan,
who wants to kill me.

265
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,394
- Mike.
- Harvey, it's enough.

266
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,828
As much as you want to help me,

267
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,997
You have no idea what it is

268
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,901
To have been a fraud
and have to start all over.

269
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,404
- I don't.

270
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,039
But someone else does.

271
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,117
- Well, well.

272
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,888
If it isn't employee
number 7611053.

273
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,922
- You still remember that.

274
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:35,026
I never lied about having a head
for numbers.

275
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,030
- I never said how sorry I was
for what happened to you.

276
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,432
- You don't need to be sorry,
mike.

277
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,867
The truth is,
I should be thanking you.

278
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,002
- What?

279
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,870
- You know what I do now?

280
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,240
Statistical analysis
for fantasy baseball.

281
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,009
- That's awesome.

282
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,277
- You don't know the half of it.

283
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,279
My old, better job,

284
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,182
I sat in my office,
crunched my numbers,

285
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,783
Made a lot more money,

286
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,086
Barely knew the name
of one person on my floor.

287
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,922
Now my best friends
are people I work with.

288
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,291
[chuckles]

289
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,829
Well, why'd you call me?

290
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,097
- The last time I saw you,

291
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,431
You had no idea
what you were gonna do

292
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,501
With the rest of your life.

293
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,071
You had
to completely start over,

294
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,740
And it looks like you did.

295
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,875
I guess I--
- want to know how.

296
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,077
- [sighs]

297
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,378
- Start by starting.

298
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,214
- What does that mean?

299
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,281
- It means, for six months,

300
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,917
I threw myself
a giant pity party,

301
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,422
I was gonna get out
of the mess I was in.

302
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,457
And then one day
I said, "enough's enough."

303
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,793
And instead of asking questions,

304
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,896
I started looking for answers.

305
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,297
- And you found
fantasy baseball.

306
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,433
- No, I found out
that how much money you make

307
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,003
Is not the most important thing
in the world.

308
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,540
Who you spend it with,
every day, is.

309
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,012
- Thanks, stan.
I appreciate it.

310
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,847
- Whoa, mike.

311
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,250
Why exactly is it
you need to start over?

312
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,284
- [chuckles]

313
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,987
That's a long story.

314
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,156
- I have time.

315
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,558
- Another day, stan.

316
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,262
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

317
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,396
Clear your schedule tonight.

318
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,098
- Done. Why?

319
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,900
- Jessica offered me
anything I want

320
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,134
As a reward for my heroism,

321
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,569
And we're gonna figure out
what that is.

322
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,404
- What's to figure out?
Named partner.

323
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,840
- No, not that.
Anything but that.

324
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,141
- What do you mean,
"anything but that?"

325
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,910
There isn't anything but that.

326
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,144
- Oh, you think
I didn't ask for it?

327
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,245
The words were out of my mouth

328
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,814
Faster than esther
when she was 13.

329
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,182
- Louis, I don't care
about your slutty sister.

330
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,516
You deserve named partner.

331
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,851
- And I don't care
that you don't care

332
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,586
Because it's not gonna happen.

333
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,856
Now, we were given a chance
to take the high road,

334
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,892
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

335
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,427
- If I were ever going to be
attracted to you,

336
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,429
Now would be the time.

337
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,865
Instead I'll prepare a list
of demands befitting a hero.

338
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,935
And don't ever talk about being
attracted to me again.

339
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,303
It weirds me out.

340
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,408
[phone ringing]

341
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,277
- The answer's no.

342
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,579
- You don't even know
what I'm here for.

343
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,280
- I know
what you're not here for.

344
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,082
To tell me after a long night
of soul-searching,

345
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,450
You've decided to give me
full control

346
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,518
Of gillis industries.

347
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,989
But I am here to give you
full control of this.

348
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,164
- This isn't public information.

349
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,132
- It will be in 24 hours.

350
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,467
So it's legal to give it to you.

351
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,035
- And it gives me a 24-hour edge

352
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,937
If I decide to act
on this information.

353
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,873
- Which, as you can see
from that filing,

354
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,041
Would be
a very profitable thing to do.

355
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,310
- And all I have to do in return
is use your law firm?

356
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,312
- I don't care
what law firm you use.

357
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,380
I just want you to have
mike ross

358
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,481
Run point on the deal.

359
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,649
- Then we're back
where we started,

360
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,150
And you can get the hell
out of my office.

361
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,386
- Jonathan,
I know what he did,

362
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,456
But he thought he had no choice.

363
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,025
- When a person
thinks he has no choice

364
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,593
Is when you see
his true character.

365
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,362
- You think you have no choice

366
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,130
Other than to be vindictive
right now.

367
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,032
- This isn't vindictive.
It's common sense.

368
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,636
You don't give the fox
another run at the henhouse.

369
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,404
- You wouldn't have even had
a shot at the henhouse

370
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,605
If it wasn't
for him getting you out

371
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,340
From under tony gianopolous.

372
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,409
- And I repaid him for that
by giving him his first shot

373
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,510
At investment banking.

374
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,544
- And where I come from,

375
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,346
The way you really repay someone

376
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,949
Is by giving them
a second goddamn shot.

377
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,252
- Then go the hell back
to where you came from.

378
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,256
And, hey,
if you think he's so great,

379
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,658
Take him back there with you.

380
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:39,103
- Louis, you have a minute?
- Not really.

381
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,939
I'm in the middle of some
very important gift-choosing.

382
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,140
- What?

383
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,441
- Yeah,
wouldn't you like to know?

384
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,609
But you never will

385
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,244
Because a person only gets gifts

386
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,346
When they fix the mistakes
that jeff malone's made.

387
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,049
- Actually, louis,
that's why I'm here.

388
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,184
I wanted to thank you
for catching that error

389
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,219
On the wexler stock.

390
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,321
- You want to thank me?

391
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,256
- Yes, louis, I do.

392
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,158
Look,
I know you don't trust me,

393
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,393
But you got us out of a jam,

394
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,629
And I'm here to thank you,
man-to-man.

395
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,164
- Bullsh--.

396
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,732
You're here to kiss my ass
because you found out

397
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,367
That I'm now above you
in the pecking order.

398
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,604
And all I found out is that
you fixed this thing for harvey,

399
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,007
And I am here to thank you.

400
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,375
- I'm not talking about harvey,
and you know it.

401
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,344
- No, louis.
- Don't play dumb with me.

402
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,112
I'm talking
about jessica pearson,

403
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,047
The woman whose ass
you've really been kissing,

404
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,749
The very same woman
who came to me

405
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,418
And asked me to check your work.

406
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,055
Yeah, uh-huh.

407
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,692
I have some lipizzaner stallions
to look at.

408
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,771
- You had louis litt
check my work?

409
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,773
- I was wondering
when we might get into this.

410
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,675
- Well, the wondering is over
because it's now.

411
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,710
And if you were going to do
something like that,

412
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,345
You should have discussed it
with me first

413
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,713
Before going behind my back.

414
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,517
And you stood right there
and said your work was perfect

415
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,785
And I should trust you.

416
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,186
- You see,
that's the problem right there.

417
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,721
You don't trust me.

418
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,724
And now you're just rubbing
my mistake in my face.

419
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,726
- If the goal
was to rub it in your face,

420
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,161
I would have done that already,

421
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,796
And we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

422
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,798
- In that case, maybe
we should keep our conversations

423
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,566
On a professional level
for a while.

424
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,568
- You're the one
who wanted to do both.

425
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,737
- And maybe I was wrong.

426
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,141
- I never said
I didn't trust you.

427
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,510
I said I didn't trust
your work on wexler.

428
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,746
- That's the difference
between us, jessica.

429
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,215
You see, when I say, "trust me,"

430
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,651
I mean trust the man
who works for you

431
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,520
And the man that's with you.

432
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,066
- You wanted to see me?

433
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,267
- You don't seem in a good mood.

434
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,069
- I'm not.

435
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,136
- We can talk about it later.

436
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,471
- I walked
all the way down here.

437
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,173
We can talk about it now.

438
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,809
- I was just gonna ask
how louis' talk went.

439
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,646
That is not an "I have to come
talk to you" conversation.

440
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,621
- I want to bring mike back.

441
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,356
- [chuckles]

442
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,358
That is not a conversation
I ever want to have.

443
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,359
- Jessica--

444
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,361
- Harvey, I haven't slept better

445
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,763
Since his last night,

446
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,731
Except for every night since,

447
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,233
And I'm not going back.

448
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,302
In case
you really were wondering,

449
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,238
Louis took his thank-you
like a dick.

450
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,574
And if that's all,
I'm going home.

451
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,486
[door clicks and squeaks]

452
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,820
[door thuds]

453
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,122
- Hey.

454
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,257
- Hey.

455
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,392
Are you cooking?
- Mmm.

456
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,494
I make one thing,

457
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,196
And I make it awesome.

458
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,633
- Mike, every single guy
thinks that his spaghetti sau--

459
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,839
Oh, my god. That's amazing.

460
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,710
- Not every single guy
was raised by his grandmother.

461
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,646
Now you sit down, shut up,

462
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,616
And tell me about your day.

463
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,918
- What got you
in such a good mood?

464
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,153
- Oh, you know, nothing.

465
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,387
Just spent the afternoon

466
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,289
Figuring out what I'm gonna do
with my life.

467
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,191
- Well, that sounds
like quite the afternoon.

468
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,693
What did you figure out?

469
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,664
- Well, I figured out
I don't want

470
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,366
To take the job with forstman,

471
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:32,637
And I don't want to be
an investment banker.

472
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,306
- So what do you want to be?

473
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,440
- I don't know.

474
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,479
But I know
I want to be with you.

475
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:45,349
- What are you saying?
- I want to start over.

476
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,517
- I don't understand.

477
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,585
- Rachel, when I met you,

478
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,753
I had nothing in my life

479
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,256
Except what came
from being a fraud.

480
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,759
And now I have nothing in it
except being with you,

481
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,761
And I wouldn't go back
even if I could because...

482
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,895
- Mike--

483
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,265
- I don't care
what I do for a living.

484
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,533
I mean, I'll figure it out,

485
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,303
But as long as I have you,

486
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,639
I have everything.

487
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,509
Rachel?
- [sobbing]

488
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,377
- What--
I didn't mean to make you cry.

489
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,213
I meant to make you
feel better.

490
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,215
Hey, hey,
everything's going to be okay.

491
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,784
- No, it's not.
- Rachel, what's wrong?

492
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,252
- I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

493
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,753
- Rachel.
- I just need a minute.

494
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,622
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm right here. You can tell me.

495
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,490
What's going on?
- I can't.

496
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,226
- Rachel, stop.
Yes you can.

497
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,660
Hey, hey.
- No, you don't--

498
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,796
I don't deserve you.
- What are you talking about?

499
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,698
Rachel, hey--
- logan and I kissed.

500
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,635
- What?

501
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,704
- We were just talking,

502
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,372
And then he--

503
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,640
- He what?

504
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,342
- Mike, please.

505
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,810
I am so sorry.

506
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,511
Mike, no, please.

507
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,248
[sobbing]

508
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,783
Please, it didn't mean anything.

509
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,985
Wait.

510
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,853
[door rattles and slams]

511
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,822
[sobbing] I'm...

512
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,698
[knocks]

513
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,339
- [grunts]

514
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,474
This is how you handle losing?

515
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,276
- I'm not here
about gillis industries.

516
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,343
- Ooh, you gonna fight me?

517
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,846
- You stay the hell away
from rachel.

518
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,382
- Well, that's up to her.

519
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,516
But if she does come back here,

520
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,385
It won't be to tell me
to stay away.

521
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,720

[grunts]

526
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,664
- Ah!

[panting]

530
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,314
I don't know what she told you.

531
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,649
[panting]

532
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,718
But she let it go on
a long time.

533
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,757
And she didn't just like it.

534
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,093
She loved it.

535
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,401
- You told him.

536
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,570
- I don't even know where he is.

537
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,772
- He's at harvey's.

538
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,574
- How do you know?

539
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,109
- Where did you go?

540
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,884
- Forstman?

541
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,086
- Logan.

542
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,722
- Gillis.

543
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,523
- Rachel.

544
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,059
- Get the hell in here.

545
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,663
- I never should have told him.

546
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:48,499
- Rachel,
there's no use thinking that.

547
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,636
- What if he doesn't forgive me?

548
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:53,804
- You don't know that he won't.

549
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,906
- You don't know that he will.

550
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,043
"this will bore a hole
in his head."

551
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,845
- And you're the one who said
you had to find a way

552
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,447
To trust him with the truth.

553
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,615
- He walked out.
I can't just--

554
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,683
- Stay here tonight?

555
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,451
Of course you can.

556
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,055
- I'm not going back there.

557
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,490
- I'm not saying you have to.

558
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,592
I'm saying
you need to calm down.

559
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,060
- Would you calm down
after someone

560
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:20,564
- I would if I knew he was just
trying to get in my head.

561
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,533
- How the hell do you know
that's all it is?

562
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,935
- Because that piece of sh--
did it to you before,

563
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,570
And I let him
because I'm his lawyer,

564
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,938
But I'm not gonna let him
do it to you now.

565
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,409
He put the image in there,
and now I can't get it out.

566
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,543
- Mike--

567
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,744
- Look, I need to know
if it's true.

568
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,746
- And what good
is gonna come of that?

569
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,786
- I just need to know.

570
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,921
- Then there's only one way
to find out.

571
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,856
But you're not gonna find out
tonight.

572
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,058
Here.

573
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,111
- Mike.

574
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,013
Oh, my god, I was so worr--

575
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,785
Oh, my god, your face.
What happened?

576
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,788
- You know what happened.

577
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,090
- You went to see logan.

578
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,659
- I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

579
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,129
Between you and him.

580
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,064
- Okay, why don't we just
go home right now,

581
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,666
And we can talk
about all of it there?

582
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,835
- You're gonna tell me
what happened right here.

583
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,603
- Mike, I--

584
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,771
- I need to know
that I can trust you,

585
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,005
Because you said

586
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,540
That it didn't mean anything,
but he said--

587
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,944
- Mike, please.
- Did it mean something or not?

588
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,179
- It meant something
when it happened, but now--

589
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,014
Okay, look.
Okay.

590
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,616
I made a huge mistake,

591
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,851
But you just asked
if you could trust me--

592
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,652
- Trust you?

593
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,187
You didn't tell me about this
for a week,

594
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,822
And then when you finally did,
you lied.

595
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,825
You walked out before I could
tell you the whole story.

596
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,895
There's no way you were going
to tell me that whole story.

597
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:01,031
- Mike, please.
- He said that you loved it!

598
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,240
And when I said
that it didn't matter

599
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,076
What I'd do next
because I have you?

600
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,880
I was wrong

601
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,214
Because we're done.

602
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,799
Okay, listen, rachel.
When you are done can you just--

603
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,001
Holy sh--, are you?

604
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:39,036
- No, I'm not.

605
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,238
- So help me, if harvey
mistreated you, I will--

606
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,239
- It wasn't harvey, louis.

607
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,741
It's mike.

608
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,075
- That son of a bitch.
Where is he?

609
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,711
Because I'll--
- it wasn't him. It was me.

610
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:54,718
- Look, I know
that he hurt you with sheila,

611
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,987
But I love him,

612
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,255
And I lost him.

613
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,657
And I don't really know
what to do.

614
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,226
- Oh, come on, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

615
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,162
Listen to me right now, okay?

616
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,031
Whatever I may think of mike,

617
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,100
I have no doubt
that he loves you.

618
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,304
And when two people
love each other,

619
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,174
No problem is insurmountable.

620
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,777
- That's bullsh--.

621
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,580
And you of all people know it.

622
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,814
- What?

623
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,316
- You and sheila
loved each other,

624
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,585
And you still broke up,

625
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,655
Even though neither of you
had done anything wrong.

626
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,057
- That's different.

627
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,693
- Did you hear me?

628
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,861
I did something wrong.

629
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,730
And now he doesn't trust me,

630
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:43,968
And I can't make him
trust me or forgive me.

631
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,271
So it doesn't matter
how much I love him, okay?

632
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,839
Becau--

633
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,307
- Okay, all right, listen.

634
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,077
Rachel, you have so much
going for you.

635
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,747
It's gonna be okay.

636
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,248
- And what good is any of it

637
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,318
If I don't have the one person
I want to share it with?

638
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:20,270
- You told mike after you
explicitly told me not to.

639
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,907
- I don't have
to explain myself to you.

640
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,310
- Really?
- I didn't mean for it--

641
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,245
- It doesn't matter what you did
or didn't mean to happen.

642
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,380
It happened,

643
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,681
And I know why it did.

644
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,016
- What are you talk--

645
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,986
- You told him
because deep down inside,

646
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,389
And you knew this
would make it happen.

647
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,723
- That is bullsh--.

648
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:43,193
Because that is exactly
what you said to me

649
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,962
When I told allison about us.

650
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,263
- That has nothing
to do with this.

651
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,399
- And since
you obviously came here

652
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,134
To find out where it is
we stand,

653
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,136
Let me tell you.

654
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,771
There is no us.

655
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,939
There will never be an us.

656
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,276
And no matter what happens
between me and mike,

657
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,213
That you and I are ever gonna
have a conversation again.

658
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,016
- You're my lawyer.
- Not anymore, logan.

659
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,785
So whatever real or fake meeting
you have with harvey,

660
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,986
You can go to it now,

661
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,088
But I won't be in it

662
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,956
Or any other meeting
you have here in the future

663
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,925
Because we're done.

664
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,968
- Louis, glad you're here.

665
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,870
I just got off the phone
with charles forstman.

666
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,006
He wants to cross the "t"s,
dot the "I"s,

667
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,874
And be done with this deal,
and so do I.

668
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,977
Nobody wants to be done
with that man more than me.

669
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,146
I'm actually heading over there
in an hour,

670
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:41,852
That I finally figured out
what I want as my reward.

671
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:45,089
- And what is that?

672
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,293
To allow for telecommuting
whenever I deem appropriate

673
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,261
And a month's more vacation
every year

674
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,930
To be used at my discretion.

675
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,798
- Anything else?

676
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,933
- I want it in writing,

677
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,134
And I want my partnership
protected

678
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,904
For as long
as this situation persists.

679
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,139
- Okay.

680
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,373
Before I give you
what you're asking--

681
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,109
- Jessica, you said I could have
whatever I want.

682
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,045
- I'm not trying
to talk you out of anything.

683
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,880
I just want to say that the fact

684
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,282
That named partner
isn't happening now

685
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,318
Doesn't mean it never will,

686
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,753
And I'd hate to see you

687
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,022
Throw in the towel
because you've lost faith.

688
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,491
- Yeah, well, the only thing
I'm throwing

689
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:23,861
Is my hat in the ring
for sheila's heart.

690
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,462
- I don't understand.

691
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,499
- I love her.

692
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,902
And I miss her.

693
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,805
And I want to try
to win her back,

694
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,342
And I need these things
to make that happen.

695
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,480
- Then you have them.

696
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,022
- Rachel, are you okay?
