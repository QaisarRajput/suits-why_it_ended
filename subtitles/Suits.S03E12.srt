1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,379
I got up early, so I could figure out

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,183
if there's anything around here
that I could stand living with.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,402
- You want to move in together?
- If the offer still stands.

4
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,020
Are you kidding me?
[Laughs]

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,740
You slept with Quentin
while he was married to me.

6
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,392
I asked you back then

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,162
if anything had started
before we were separated.

8
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,413
You said it hadn't.

9
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:23,727
'Cause I didn't want to hurt you.

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,233
Here's to your new partnership.

11
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,668
I fronted your buy-in.

12
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,170
How could you do that?

13
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:31,288
I did it as a romantic gesture.

14
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,456
Yeah, well,<i>Pretty Woman</i>
may have been a romantic movie,

15
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:33,987
but Julia Roberts was still a hooker.

16
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,709
How long have you known
Quentin had A.L.S.?

17
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,961
From the beginning.

18
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,772
And how long have you known
Quentin falsified

19
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:41,015
trial results to get
the drug on the market?

20
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,600
- He didn't lie.
- But you did.

21
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,718
I love him.
So what else could I do?

22
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,720
I am in this, Scottie.

23
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:49,106
Okay.

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,608
So am I.

25
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,226
I think Mike Ross
went to a subpar law school

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,727
and has been lying about it the whole time.

27
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,029
Just call up Harvard and ask for a copy

28
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:56,313
of his transcript.

29
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,065
Professor Gerard's legal ethics class,

30
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,900
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

31
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,986
No, he's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

32
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:20,588
Well, what are you so happy about?

33
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,622
I made bubble-wrap slippers
this morning

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,641
while you were in the shower.

35
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:25,009
I specifically told you the bubble wrap

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,477
is for the dishes.

37
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:27,728
I also made a hat.

38
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:28,962
Okay, I'm moving in
with a ten-year-old.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,464
And you love me.

40
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:31,849
[Laughs] I do.

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,933
Hey, I was thinking,

42
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,934
what are we going to do about our bed?

43
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,019
We already have two.

44
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,487
I know, but, yeah, we do.

45
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:39,240
But don't you think a new
beginning deserves a new bed?

46
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:44,278
That... is incredibly sweet.

47
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,780
Yeah, not bad
for a ten-year-old, huh?

48
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:48,332
What kind of bed were you thinking?

49
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:51,669
Whichever one we pick out
after we test them tonight.

50
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:54,872
And did you have
any particular test in mind?

51
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:56,323
Well, now I do.

52
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,324
See, I don't think the store is

53
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:58,592
gonna let us run that kind of test.

54
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,010
Yeah.
No, you're right.

55
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,129
We should probably just test
ours before we go out tonight.

56
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,165
Oh.

57
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,934
What are you doing?

58
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,436
I think that Louis might have just seen us.

59
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,711
Come on, what's the difference?

60
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,056
We're moving in together.

61
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:13,607
I think it's time
we stopped keeping it a secret.

62
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,976
But keeping it a secret is sort of fun.

63
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,062
- Mm-hmm.
- And sexy.

64
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:19,363
And I am pro sexy...
I mean, I did make

65
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,365
those bubble-wrap slippers
and hat after all,

66
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,033
which is funny, 'cause...

67
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,152
That's not sexy, it's just fun.

68
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,988
- It's something.
- Something.

69
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,357
- Something.
- I made you some too.

70
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,751
Hey, Harvey, she won't be back
for another week,

71
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,369
so I don't think you need
to start drinking just yet.

72
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,671
You want to make fun,
or you want to help me

73
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,589
figure out where to put this?

74
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,924
A bottle of scotch?

75
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:48,842
You couldn't get her
anything more personal?

76
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,095
- She likes scotch.
- <i>You</i> like scotch.

77
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,479
She likes me.
Therefore...

78
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,148
Why don't you just attach a card that says,

79
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,550
"Welcome, generic senior partner"?

80
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,902
This is a $12,000 bottle of scotch,

81
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,388
and this is one of three left in the world.

82
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,223
That doesn't say generic, that says...

83
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,742
You're one of three very expensive things

84
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:05,909
I recently purchased.

85
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,894
We worked it out
about the buy-in.

86
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:08,996
And this is gonna
un-work it out.

87
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,247
You know, it's funny.

88
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:12,399
First it was too generic.
Now it's special.

89
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,834
What are you saying?

90
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:15,202
I don't think you have a
problem with my choice of gift.

91
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,755
I think you have a problem
with my choice of recipient.

92
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,740
Do you think Scottie would even be here

93
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:20,741
if it wasn't for me?

94
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,210
No, I don't.

95
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,795
Harvey, I want this for you.

96
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:28,265
I want it to work,
and I'm just trying to...

97
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,583
Make sure I don't screw it up.

98
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,218
Well, we both know
you're gonna screw it up.

99
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,138
I'm just trying to delay that
as long as possible.

100
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,424
You sure about this?

101
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,560
That bottle is the reason
I buy my own present

102
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,944
for secretary's day.

103
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,696
- There's a secretary's day?
- There is.

104
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,032
And you're very generous.

105
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,654
[Sighs]

106
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,072
How you doing, Mike?

107
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,409
Are you excited or what?
[Chuckles]

108
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,327
Excited about what?

109
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,612
Didn't you get my email?

110
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,164
[Phone beeps] Oh, there it is.

111
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,415
Why don't you read it?

112
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,549
Oh, actually, you know what, never mind.

113
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,117
I'll just let you know what it says.

114
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,335
[Laughs] It's so great.

115
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,221
You're gonna love it.

116
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:12,176
It says I invited Henry Gerard here

117
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,894
to give a lecture this Friday.

118
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,729
That's great.

119
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:19,650
You don't even know who he is, do you?

120
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:21,435
Professor Henry Gerard,

121
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,821
author of the definitive text
in legal ethics

122
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,190
and chair of the department
for the last 20 years.

123
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:27,808
Yeah, I know who he is.

124
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:31,528
And do you also remember
what you got in his class?

125
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:32,780
It's pretty hard to forget
an A-plus.

126
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,314
Yeah, it's pretty hard to forget a grade

127
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,583
that never happened.

128
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,171
No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

129
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,187
Yeah, well, no one can recite
an entire chapter

130
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,262
of his book from memory.

131
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,764
But I can and did.
Bullshit-.

132
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,183
You never got an A-plus because
you never took his class.

133
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:55,853
It's a required class, Louis.
Of course I took it.

134
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:56,970
Not if you never went to Harvard.

135
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,004
Louis, that is insane.

136
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,389
I have a transcript from Harvard.

137
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,141
I have a degree from Harvard.
That's because I...

138
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:06,063
Wait, let me guess.
'Cause you went to Harvard?

139
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:09,700
See, Mike, here's the situation.

140
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,569
I don't believe you.

141
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,988
And I don't want to call
Gerard up and ask him

142
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,858
'cause I don't want
the world laughing at my firm.

143
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,693
But if he doesn't walk up to you on Friday

144
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:23,029
and say, "Mike Ross, my beloved student

145
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,132
"who I remember, because he's the only one

146
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,633
I ever gave an A-plus to,"

147
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,670
well, then, I'm gonna know you're lying.

148
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,721
And if you still don't come clean,

149
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,556
I'm gonna launch a formal investigation,

150
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,708
whether it makes my firm look bad or not.

151
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,877
This is crazy.
There is nothing to investigate.

152
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,730
Well, I'd rather risk looking
crazy to root out an impostor

153
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,349
than to risk letting
that impostor poison everything

154
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,718
that I stand for.

155
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,404
It's over, Mike.

156
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:49,740
I'm on to you,

157
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,325
and I'm gonna expose you

158
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:55,362
for the lying piece of filth that you are.

159
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,308
Don't forget to rinse your mouth out

160
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,002
after you're done throwing up.

161

[Clears throat]

172
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:48,049
Do you remember when you said
if Louis knew, we'd know?

173
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,500
He knows.

174
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:50,518
What did he do?

175
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,019
He's bringing in Henry Gerard

176
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,688
to give a lecture.
So what?

177
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,723
It'll only be the first time
you've had to suffer through it.

178
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,275
He's bringing him in because he saw

179
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,643
I got an A-plus
in his class.

180
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:01,011
What? No one gets an A-plus
in Gerard's class.

181
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,364
- Welcome to the problem.
- God damn it.

182
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:04,682
Donna, get in here.

183
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,033
Why are you calling Donna?

184
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,352
Because she's the one
who found out that Louis knows

185
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,620
you don't have a file
in the Harvard file room.

186
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:10,621
How do you know that?

187
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:11,956
Because Louis's new girlfriend

188
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,124
is the queen of that file room,

189
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,438
and she left him alone in there.

190
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,043
You guys didn't think to mention this?

191
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:17,545
I thought I handled it.

192
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,713
She did handle it.

193
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,581
She sent him to sniff out your transcript.

194
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,272
Only she didn't realize you gave yourself

195
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,718
an A-plus in legal ethics.

196
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,503
I didn't give it to myself.
Lola Jensen did.

197
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:27,004
I don't give a shit who gave it to you,

198
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,557
unless it was Professor Gerard,
which it wasn't.

199
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,925
How many people take the class?

200
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,894
I mean, maybe Mike will just be
another face in the crowd.

201
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,044
Louis is bringing him here

202
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,763
to see if he embraces his star student.

203
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,382
The worst thing I can do is just
be another face in the crowd.

204
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,568
We need to make it so that he doesn't come.

205
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:41,769
It's not gonna happen.

206
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,654
The man doesn't back out of commitments.

207
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:46,407
His favorite quote is "for the law to work,

208
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,493
there must be honor
in one's word."

209
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,027
- Who's he quoting?
- Himself.

210
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,162
Pompous prick.

211
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,997
Guy never practiced a day in his life,

212
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,082
thinks he can write the book
on real-world ethics.

213
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:56,784
Okay.

214
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,287
I'm not panicking,
but what are we gonna do?

215
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,422
Right now, you're gonna sit tight.

216
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:02,673
And what are you going to do?

217
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,460
I think it's time to tell Jessica.

218
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,578
[Sighs]

219
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:08,930
We need to talk.

220
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,081
- We do.
- You know?

221
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,886
No, but whatever it is, it can wait.

222
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,138
This isn't something that can wait.

223
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,643
Quentin died.

224
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,812
I'm sorry.

225
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,786
I knew A.L.S.
wasn't gonna be a picnic.

226
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:37,491
And I knew this was coming,
but it doesn't...

227
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,964
Look, if you need some time,
I can manage things here.

228
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:46,717
The truth is, Harvey, I'd take it.

229
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:49,787
But Lisa's on her way in

230
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,007
to discuss Quentin's will with us.

231
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,392
Us?

232
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:59,847
Quentin named you and I
co-executors of his estate.

233
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,465
You're her husband's ex-wife.

234
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,484
I doubt Lisa sees this as just business.

235
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:04,852
No, I can't imagine she does.

236
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:07,939
Can you see this as just business?

237
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,357
You don't like her,

238
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,527
you don't trust her, and you
have good reason for both.

239
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,580
Quentin asked me to do this.

240
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:22,286
Maybe he gave you
a co-executor for a reason.

241
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,171
You're saying he was giving me an out?

242
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:26,123
No, I'm just saying that I'm here,

243
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:28,759
and you don't have to do this.

244
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:33,764
Harvey, he asked me,

245
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,017
and I'm not going to let him down.

246
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,174
Mike, you can't just wait
for the ax to fall.

247
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,311
I didn't just wait.
I armed myself.

248
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:50,982
I learned everything there is to
know about Gerard and his class.

249
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,533
Harvey is right.
This guy is a prick.

250
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,684
He makes everybody read his books

251
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:54,952
and then doesn't even test on them.

252
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,404
Okay, but arming yourself isn't enough.

253
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,072
We need to actually do something.

254
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,825
Harvey told me to sit tight.

255
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,543
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

256
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,696
Right, that's because
Harvey's life isn't on the line.

257
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,466
Ours is.

258
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,887
Ours?

259
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,007
Mike, I am not moving in with you

260
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,560
because I need a new place to live.

261
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:22,096
Okay, so what do you think we should do?

262
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,649
What's gonna make him believe
that you went to Harvard?

263
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,400
Well, if my transcript, diploma,

264
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:28,486
and the job you can only get
by having attended Harvard

265
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,321
aren't enough, I'm not really sure what is.

266
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,156
Well, there's got to be
something you can say.

267
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,224
Look, Rachel, you know Louis.

268
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,242
The more I try and deny it,

269
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:38,112
the more he's gonna come after me.

270
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,747
I can't believe this.

271
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:41,261
He is not gonna be happy until he has

272
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,418
a signed full confession
proving he was right.

273
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:50,374
You're right.

274
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:54,011
And that's exactly what I'm gonna give him.

275
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,429
Come on.

276
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,847
It's all fairly straightforward.

277
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,516
The company shouldn't be affected.

278
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,718
Tim can continue
with the day-to-day

279
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,753
while this works its way through probate.

280
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:06,857
Well, the day-to-day's
going to change.

281
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,527
- How so?
- We have an offer from Pryzen.

282
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,861
You want to sell the company?

283
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:14,648
I want to accept an offer.

284
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,068
Well, that was fast.

285
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:18,452
Excuse me?

286
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,987
What Jessica is saying is

287
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:22,289
Pryzen didn't waste any time swooping in.

288
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:24,492
No, what I'm saying is,

289
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,776
before we authorize anything,

290
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,995
we need to evaluate
if this is even a good idea.

291
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,497
I don't see why.

292
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,549
Our general counsel thinks
it's a good idea, and I agree.

293
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,119
And I'm the one who's inheriting
the majority of the company,

294
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,088
so it's my decision.
Actually, it isn't.

295
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,422
What are you talking about?

296
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,509
My job is to see that
Quentin's wishes are fulfilled.

297
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Are you implying that you know his wishes

298
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,845
better than I do?

299
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,296
I'm implying he's not dead a week,

300
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,232
and you want to strip his name
off the door and into oblivion.

301
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:50,300
What I want to do is put the drug

302
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:51,736
that he dedicated his life to

303
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,156
in the hands of a company
with the resources to finish it.

304
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,192
And I was there when he worked
for companies like this.

305
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:01,328
And he hated them, which is why
he went out on his own.

306
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,696
You were there?

307
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,750
Well, that's not how I heard the story.

308
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:09,370
All right, we're not doing this.

309
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,655
You want to sell your shares?
No one's saying you can't.

310
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:15,509
But we have a responsibility
to evaluate it.

311
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:18,345
Remember when you said
you'd try to be conciliatory?

312
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,713
I never said that.

313
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:22,099
Well, you should have,
'cause you sure couldn't

314
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,684
keep the personal out of it.

315
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:24,852
I didn't think they were gonna come at me

316
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:25,853
with all that stuff.

317
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,004
They weren't coming at you.

318
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,606
They were coming with a proposal.

319
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,277
Do you really think
that offer came out of thin air?

320
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,062
I think it's possible
they waited to pounce.

321
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:36,346
It's also possible

322
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,399
that Lisa and Tim put this in motion

323
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,484
while Quentin was lying
in his hospital bed.

324
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:43,370
And what if they did?
Is that really our business?

325
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:46,157
Jessica, I understand
how hard this is for you,

326
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,325
but his legacy is this drug.

327
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,578
It's not about whose name
is on the company that makes it.

328
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,696
You're saying you agree with Lisa.

329
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,082
I'm saying to you now
what I tried to tell you before.

330
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,419
This is personal for you.
It's not personal for me.

331
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,423
So before we take another step,
let me evaluate this offer.

332
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:03,641
[Knock at door]

333
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,045
You're right.

334
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:11,348
I lied to you.

335
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:13,484
I lied to everyone.

336
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:14,568
I cheated to get here,

337
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,053
and if you put me in front of Henry Gerard,

338
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,404
he's not gonna remember me.

339
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,722
'Cause you never took his class.

340
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,940
Because I never went to his class.

341
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,025
'Cause you never went to Harvard.

342
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,443
- That's not true.
- Bullshit.

343
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,028
Louis, please, look, I know
you have every right to be angry

344
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,162
with me.
I'm not angry.

345
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:27,397
Angry is just a flash in the pan.

346
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,999
My outrage is here to stay,

347
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,452
and I will obliterate any
infection threatening my firm.

348
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,087
I'm not the infection you think I am.

349
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:36,790
The only thing that's bullshit
is that A -plus!

350
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:43,848
What?

351
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,915
Louis, I went to Harvard.

352
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,468
I...

353
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,887
I just changed my grade.

354
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:52,389
You expect me to believe that?

355
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,641
I have always been the smartest kid

356
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,442
at every school that I went to.

357
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:58,479
High school, college,
the first two years of Harvard,

358
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,813
I'd get "A" s without studying.

359
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:03,984
I'd ace every test
without going to class, but...

360
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,069
but that third year...

361
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,620
You had to take Gerard.

362
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,738
I could memorize his books,

363
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,156
but his tests weren't about his books.

364
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,108
Yeah, they're about his lectures.

365
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,494
The final exam...
I failed it.

366
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:15,212
I went to his office to beg
for a second chance.

367
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,280
He doesn't give second chances.

368
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,083
- I had to try.
- He wouldn't do it.

369
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,252
He wasn't there.

370
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:23,120
I got to his office.
It was empty.

371
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:24,471
His computer was just sitting there,

372
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,923
logged in to the main system.

373
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,391
He was about to submit his grades.

374
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:30,511
I only had a few seconds
before he came back, so...

375
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:33,264
I decided to save myself.

376
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,966
No, you decided
to give yourself an A-plus.

377
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:38,519
No, Louis.

378
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,637
You might not be able to believe me

379
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,974
about anything else ever again.

380
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:47,611
Believe this.

381
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:50,447
You have no idea how much
I wish I could do it over again,

382
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,167
because this time, I would do it right.

383
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:56,203
I would go to every class, and I
would attend every lecture,

384
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:59,156
and I would feast
on what that place has to offer

385
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:01,091
like no one ever has.

386
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,766
But you didn't do it right the first time.

387
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,011
You cheated, and now you're looking at me

388
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,346
to help you get away with it.
No, Louis-

389
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,164
Get out of my sight.

390
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,981
What a surprise.

391
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:17,939
Louis, please, I just want to...

392
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:19,824
I know what you want to do...
you want to lobby me

393
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,209
on behalf of someone
who had the audacity...

394
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,945
I love him.

395
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,330
What?

396
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,881
We're moving in together,
and we're starting

397
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,133
a life together.
Rachel-

398
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:31,553
and I'm telling you this
because I know what he did

399
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:34,689
and I still love him.

400
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,858
Okay, here's the problem.

401
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,493
I don't.

402
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,728
- Louis.
- Rachel...

403
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,630
I respect you.

404
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,182
I care about you.

405
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,501
But this isn't about you.

406
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,737
This is about Mike and what he did to me.

407
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:53,074
You know,

408
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:55,142
he came to me the night that you asked him

409
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,028
to be your associate.

410
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,446
I told him to go with you.

411
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,114
Why?

412
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:01,165
Because he said he had
a connection with you

413
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,617
that he's never had with Harvey.

414
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,002
- He said that?
- Yes.

415
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,170
Your shared love of the law.

416
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,172
- Yeah, I told him that.
- I know.

417
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,874
And I have the same connection with you.

418
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,460
Rachel, you're asking me to...

419
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,495
Louis, he didn't do this to you.

420
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,193
He did it so that he can practice the thing

421
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:17,498
that we all love.

422
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:21,019
And if you don't let it go,

423
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:25,473
he's never gonna be able
to practice it again.

424
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,482
Thank you for coming alone.

425
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:37,402
I'm happy to help,
but Jessica and I are a team,

426
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,704
and asking to see me alone
doesn't change that.

427
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:41,339
I'm not gonna cut her out of the process.

428
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:43,791
Isn't that what she's doing to me?

429
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,129
She's trying to kill the sale.

430
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:49,547
That's not what this letter says.

431
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:51,082
I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not stupid.

432
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,868
It says all communication
goes through Pearson Specter.

433
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,137
- This doesn't kill the deal.
- It tells them that

434
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,372
they've been negotiating with
people with no power at all.

435
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,674
No, it tells them they have

436
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,010
to negotiate with two entities
instead of just one.

437
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:05,263
It gives us more firepower.

438
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:06,981
What do you want, Lisa?

439
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:09,100
I want to know why your
signature isn't on that letter.

440
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:10,401
Because we came to a consensus,

441
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:12,520
and she signed it on both our behalves.

442
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,388
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

443
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,274
And if you can't handle us
notifying the buyer

444
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,659
that we're evaluating this sale,

445
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:18,826
then it makes me question

446
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,445
whose judgment is really clouded.

447
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,030
Now, if you'll excuse me,

448
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:24,248
I'm done meeting behind my partner's back.

449
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:28,512
What the hell happened to letting me

450
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:29,787
evaluate this offer?

451
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,739
I am letting you evaluate the offer.

452
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:33,708
You sent this letter to kill the deal.

453
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,877
I sent that letter to buy you time.

454
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,095
Jessica, you put my name

455
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,180
on a document you knew I wouldn't support.

456
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,684
You are on Lisa's side.
You want to sell.

457
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:45,303
This isn't about Lisa,
and I don't give a shit

458
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,804
whether this company is sold or not.

459
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,640
This is about you and me and how
we're going to run this firm.

460
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:50,975
Didn't we just have
a conversation about that?

461
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,060
Yeah, we sure did.

462
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:53,227
And when it had to do with Scottie,

463
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,279
you gave me a big speech about trust,

464
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,198
about how I had to trust
you had rational reasons

465
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:58,199
for what you were doing.

466
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,284
- This is different.
- Exactly.

467
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,036
This time it's not personal for me.

468
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,270
It's personal for you.

469
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:04,655
And you're not playing by your own rules.

470
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,574
This deal is wrong, Harvey.

471
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,943
And like it or not,
I'm still the managing partner.

472
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,128
Not on this.

473
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,879
On this,
you're a co-executor,

474
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:13,047
and you're not putting
my name on any more letters.

475
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:15,616
So I suggest you get your head on straight

476
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,001
and look at this deal rationally.

477
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,503
And if you can't do that,

478
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:22,090
I suggest you step aside.

479
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:24,342
Jessica, you loved him.

480
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:27,395
I know you're hurting.
So is she.

481
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,314
Whatever your history with her,

482
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,266
so is she.

483
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,864
You're here late.

484
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:48,616
The life of an associate, right?

485
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,702
Ah, yeah, I remember.

486
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:54,005
I used to live in this room,

487
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,840
work piled all around me,

488
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:59,010
surviving on coffee, delivery,

489
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:01,796
and no sleep.

490
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,097
And the whole time, wondering,

491
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:06,100
"man, is it ever gonna get
any easier?"

492
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,169
- Does it?
- No.

493
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:10,938
But you still love it.

494
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,474
And so do you.

495
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:14,675
Or else you'd be home with the woman

496
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:19,864
who loves you,
not spending your night here.

497
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:23,117
- You know.
- She came to see me.

498
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:24,351
I didn't think I could forgive you.

499
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,521
But then somehow, she...

500
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,873
Made me realize I could.

501
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:32,376
[Sighs]

502
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:34,528
Louis, I don't know how to thank you.

503
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,530
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't thank me yet.

504
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,332
I'm not the one you did this to.

505
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,634
What are you saying?

506
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,719
I'm saying you did this to Henry Gerard.

507
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,638
And it's not my place to let it go for him,

508
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,806
which is why you're gonna have
to come clean to him.

509
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,890
You said it yourself.

510
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:47,425
Gerard doesn't give second chances.

511
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,595
What he does or doesn't do is up to him.

512
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:53,848
That's his right, Mike,
as the person that you wronged.

513
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,216
Yeah, but he doesn't have
to know that I wronged him.

514
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,717
Listen to me.

515
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,487
You said that if you had it
to do over, you'd do it right.

516
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:02,056
I'm giving you that chance.

517
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,491
Take it,

518
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:06,527
or I'm gonna have to take it for you.

519
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:38,860
What are you here to do now,

520
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:41,663
take my house away from me?

521
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,115
I'm here to talk.

522
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,899
Well, the last time we talked,
you pretty much said

523
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:49,838
I don't care about my husband
enough to honor his wishes.

524
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,957
The last time we talked,

525
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,426
I was an asshole.

526
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,427
Pardon my French.

527
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:58,513
I don't mind your French.

528
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,749
It's come to my attention
that I may have let

529
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:05,086
our history affect
how I'm handling this situation.

530
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:06,254
It's funny.

531
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,590
Harvey brought that same thing
to my attention.

532
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,759
So...

533
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:12,778
Tell me this.

534
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,699
Why do you want to sell?

535
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,269
Do you know why I lied
about those A.L.S. trials?

536
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,573
Because I was desperate
for the research to continue.

537
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,876
But it didn't matter.

538
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,628
Lisa.

539
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,546
He wasn't supposed to die.

540
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,716
He wasn't supposed to live
as long as he did.

541
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,501
We weren't trying to prolong his life.

542
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:40,455
We were trying to find a cure.

543
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:43,124
And we failed.

544
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:45,310
You never cared about the money.

545
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,597
The only money I cared about is

546
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:51,733
the money to find the cure,
and we don't have the resources.

547
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,818
Pryzen does.

548
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,519
But they already
have an A.L.S. drug.

549
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,406
- It's not as good as ours.
- In profit margin, it's better.

550
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,241
Which means there's nothing to stop them

551
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:02,361
from buying your company,
burying your drug,

552
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,363
and making a fortune.

553
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:05,864
What are you saying?

554
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,033
I'm saying you didn't fail him,

555
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:10,702
but I know how it feels
to think that you did.

556
00:22:10,753 --> 00:22:14,006
And I have a way to make sure
that neither one of us

557
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,291
feels that way again.

558
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,326
So your great plan backfired.

559
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:19,994
Harvey, I'm sorry.

560
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,096
I don't need you to say I'm sorry.

561
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,464
But the next time I tell you to sit tight,

562
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,216
I need you to say you will.
Okay.

563
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,267
Good, because the next time

564
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,219
I tell you to sit tight is right now.

565
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,553
Wait, what are you gonna do?

566
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:30,022
I'm getting on a plane to Boston.

567
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,473
And doing what?

568
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:32,868
I'll let you know when I get back.

569
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,943
Why are you going to Boston?

570
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:37,229
I have to see Marcus.
He's in trouble.

571
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,114
Anything I can do?

572
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,366
No, I'll handle it myself.

573
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,785
Since you're leaving,
I'm going to need you to draft

574
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,570
some language for the Sainz
pharmaceutical sale.

575
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:47,372
So you're in favor of it now?

576
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,990
Well, not exactly.

577
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,909
But I heard what you said,
and I went to see Lisa.

578
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160
She and I are on the same page.

579
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:55,464
Do you have time to hear what the plan is?

580
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:58,250
I trust you.

581
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,386
So what do you need me to draft?

582
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,171
I need you to draft
a provision that guarantees

583
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,173
Pryzen will finish developing that drug.

584
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,475
Consider it done.

585
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,394
He's not seeing his brother, is he?

586
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,514
No, he's not.

587
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,883
- Care to elaborate on that?
- Not particularly.

588
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,686
You're saying I should trust him.

589
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,522
I'm saying I do.

590
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,705
I'd ask how you're holding up,
but I can see the answer.

591
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,730
[Sighs]

592
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:30,782
Not well.

593
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,667
I can only imagine
what these last couple of days

594
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,919
have been like for you.

595
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:35,737
But I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.

596
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:37,622
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

597
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:40,008
- But what if it's not?
- Well, then we're screwed.

598
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,927
But that's not gonna happen.

599
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,578
Look, Donna.

600
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:47,048
I am trying so hard to be brave.

601
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,583
But what if Louis ends up finding out

602
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,436
everything about Mike?

603
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,438
What if he ends up exposing him
and he actually gets arrested?

604
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,442
What if he actually...

605
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,560
God.

606
00:23:58,594 --> 00:23:59,594
Rach,

607
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,132
Mike found out that one of our partners

608
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,781
ordered multiple murders.

609
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:05,117
Harvey said he'd fix it.

610
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,268
Two days later, that partner was in prison.

611
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,938
Stephen was a criminal.
This is an academic.

612
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,706
He hasn't done anything wrong.

613
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,492
Well, what makes Harvey great
at his job is he knows

614
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:15,627
that everybody has done something wrong.

615
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:19,631
Even the most esteemed
ethics professor in the country?

616
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:20,916
The cleaner they look,

617
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,251
the more dirt they've swept under the rug.

618
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:25,387
I'm telling you,
Harvey's gonna walk in there,

619
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,755
he's gonna find the lump,

620
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,558
and Henry Gerard is not
gonna know what hit him.

621
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,261
Wednesday nights,
8:00 to 10:00,

622
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:35,129
it's like clockwork.
[Chuckles]

623
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:37,149
Consistency is nothing to be feared.

624
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,301
I wasn't afraid of it.
I was counting on it.

625
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,320
Mr. Specter.

626
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,822
Professor Gerard.

627
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:46,107
Looks the same as the last time I was here.

628
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,326
Can't say you look the same
as the last time you were here.

629
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,644
Yes, you can.

630
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,913
[Chuckles]

631
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,314
I see you're as humble as ever.

632
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:55,500
We'll see who's humble in a few minutes.

633
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,868
And for the record,

634
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:58,837
you were wrong about how I'd turn out.

635
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:00,338
I know how you turned out.

636
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,508
More settlements than
any other lawyer in New York.

637
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,460
More closings than
any other lawyer in New York.

638
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,512
And settling is what it takes
to get the job done

639
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,797
in the real world.

640
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:10,672
I know what it takes for you
to do what you do,

641
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,834
and compromising your way through life

642
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:15,837
is no way to go about the law.

643
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:19,307
I see you're as pompous as ever.

644
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,643
What did you come here for,
Mr. Specter?

645
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:24,178
- I came to ask for a favor.
- The answer is no.

646
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:25,437
You don't even know what it is.

647
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,865
I know you're the one who's asking.

648
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,985
I figured you'd say that,
which is why I brought this.

649
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:35,189
I don't consider blackmail a favor.

650
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,025
I doubt the trustees
will care about semantics

651
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:38,693
when they see that.

652
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,195
Well, I doubt the trustees
are gonna see anything at all.

653
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:43,131
Because that envelope is full
of blank paper

654
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,917
or your dry cleaning receipts.

655
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:48,386
You think I'm bluffing?

656
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,838
I know you are.

657
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:51,890
If you think that envelope is meaningless.

658
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:53,285
Why don't you go ahead and open it?

659
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:55,594
Your poker face has gotten much better,

660
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:56,595
I'll give you that.

661
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:58,013
A lot of practice, you know,

662
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,982
compromising my way through life.

663
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,403
- You know.
- I know.

664
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,439
And you talk a big game,

665
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,074
but you're just as human as everyone else,

666
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,493
you smug son of a bitch.

667
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,030
What's your favor?

668
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:17,749
Find a reason to cancel
your trip on Friday.

669
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:20,168
And if Louis Litt ever tries
to contact you after that,

670
00:26:20,202 --> 00:26:21,736
don't take his call.

671
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:24,456
- Seems easy enough.
- It is.

672
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:27,709
Have a good night, Professor Gerard.

673
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:31,129
Here's the problem,
Mr. Specter.

674
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,132
I don't only talk a big game.
I walk it.

675
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:38,720
And ethics is not about
never doing anything wrong.

676
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:42,023
It's about making choices.

677
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,977
And I'm not going to let you
make my choice for me.

678
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:50,782
So go do whatever you're gonna do,

679
00:26:50,816 --> 00:26:52,867
but I'm not canceling my trip.

680
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:14,073
- You didn't get it done.
- How'd you know?

681
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,108
Because I know you would call
to tell me if it's okay.

682
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,411
And you didn't call, so it's not okay.

683
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,630
Then why are you so calm?

684
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:21,631
Because you've taught me enough to know

685
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:24,116
that it's going to be okay.

686
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,969
- It's not.
- What?

687
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:29,839
It's not gonna be okay.
I don't see what we're gonna do.

688
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,290
What do you mean you don't see
what we're gonna do?

689
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:32,475
You're Harvey Specter.

690
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:33,476
What's that supposed to mean?

691
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,644
It means there's a gun

692
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:35,678
pointed at our heads.

693
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:37,963
There's 146 things that we can do.

694
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,482
We just have to put our heads
together and figure it out.

695
00:27:39,516 --> 00:27:40,816
What the hell do you think I've been doing

696
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,018
all goddamn night?

697
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,236
Louis has us, he's not gonna let it go,

698
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,938
and there's nothing we can do to stop it.

699
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,356
- There has to be something.
- There isn't.

700
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:49,191
Well, I refuse to believe that.

701
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,476
I don't give a shit what you believe.

702
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,078
Get it through your head.
I'm not superman.

703
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:55,648
I failed, and I don't know what to do.

704
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,867
Mike.

705
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,857
Tim, I thought I was meeting with Lisa.

706
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,559
And I thought you were above board.

707
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,027
I see you've read our amendment.

708
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:27,363
You drafted a provision
that if they didn't spend

709
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:29,014
$100 million finishing that drug,

710
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,033
they'd have to pay us
an extra $100 million.

711
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:32,868
I drafted a provision to see

712
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:34,853
if they'd put their money
where their mouth is.

713
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:36,021
What you did was
what you always wanted to do...

714
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,323
tank this deal.

715
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:39,709
- They pulled the offer.
- They yanked the offer.

716
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:42,244
Then the deal wasn't worth
anything to begin with.

717
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:43,245
What wasn't worth anything

718
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:45,381
was the document you had Quentin sign

719
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,299
making you executor instead of me.

720
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,835
I didn't have Quentin sign anything.

721
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,054
Well, maybe you didn't have him sign it,

722
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:54,173
but I know when he signed it,

723
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:55,558
and it's not gonna hold up.

724
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:57,593
It'll hold up just fine.

725
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:59,211
We'll see.

726
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:02,148
This is a subpoena.

727
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,018
So the next time we have this conversation,

728
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:08,571
you'll be under oath.

729
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:19,448
What exactly is he claiming?

730
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:21,283
He's saying Quentin wasn't competent

731
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,735
when he made me executor.

732
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:23,919
So let him say it.

733
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,038
I don't see where there's a problem.

734
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,240
Yes, you do.

735
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:29,375
No, I don't.

736
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,510
Just get up on the stand
and testify that Tim

737
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,845
doesn't know what he's talking about.

738
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,079
But he does.

739
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:35,765
Quentin knew what he wanted.

740
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,916
They're not going to ask me that.

741
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:40,019
They're going to ask me
about his condition.

742
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,638
I saw him, Lisa.

743
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,190
I know what he was like.

744
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:47,092
Quentin knew what he wanted.

745
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,762
He was also medicated, could barely speak,

746
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,897
and he was in a lot of pain.

747
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:54,283
But you don't have to say those things.

748
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:57,286
I'm going to have to swear
to this under oath.

749
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,789
If making you executor
wasn't legally valid,

750
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:01,373
then why didn't you say so when he did it?

751
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,209
Because I didn't think
it would be challenged.

752
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:05,461
And thinking something might not hold up

753
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:06,816
and keeping that thought to myself

754
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,615
is not the same
as lying about it under oath.

755
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:12,585
Well, those are some fuzzy damn lines.

756
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,638
I didn't make them.
They came with the job.

757
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:19,458
You're gonna undo everything
he's ever worked for.

758
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:22,294
Maybe.

759
00:30:22,312 --> 00:30:24,963
But just because you and I
want the same thing

760
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:27,516
doesn't mean that I'm willing
to perjure myself to get it.

761
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,488
Please.

762
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:35,074
You said you didn't want to fail him again.

763
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,125
You didn't fail.

764
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:58,013
You don't need to make me feel better.

765
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,098
I'm not trying to make you feel better.

766
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:02,468
I'm just telling you the truth.

767
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:06,105
You didn't fail because...

768
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,973
We were always playing on borrowed time.

769
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:10,526
- Mike.
- Harvey.

770
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,512
I wouldn't have any of this without you.

771
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,400
I think it's time I cut your exposure.

772
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,035
You don't have to do that.

773
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,071
It's all gonna come crashing down anyway.

774
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,406
I'm gonna go to Louis.

775
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:25,791
I'm going to resign,

776
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:28,193
and I'm gonna beg him
to let this whole thing go.

777
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,197
Then I'm going with you.

778

Harvey,

779
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,052
when Trevor went to Jessica with my secret,

780
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:40,172
I felt betrayed.

781
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:44,176
I lost my closest friend in the world.

782
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,545
And I know you don't like to admit it,

783
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:49,565
but we're friends.

784
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:54,653
And I'm not gonna betray my friend.

785
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:31,016
I used to hate this kind of thing.

786

- What kind of thing?
- Guest lectures.

00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,870
Move over.

964
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:34,509
Did you take care of your Marcus problem?

965
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:38,397
For the time being.

966
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,982
Good.

967
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:47,522
It wasn't really a Marcus problem.

968
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:51,526
I know.

969
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,026
You want to hear the truth?

970
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:58,174
Not tonight.

971
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:00,508
That's why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

972
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,788
I know.

973
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:09,813
