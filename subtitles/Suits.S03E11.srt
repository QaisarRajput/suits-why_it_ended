that I put you in this position,

is for you to go to Stanford.

Yes.

163
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,869
I'm not gonna let that piece
of shit get a penny from us.

164
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:29,605
I said yes.

165
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,074
Thanks, Harvey.

166
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:32,742
You want to thank me,

167
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:36,379
why don't you go beat
the shit out of this guy?

168
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,834
Monday, 2:20 p.m.

169
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,585
[Sighs]

170
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,954
This conundrum is burning a hole
in my brain.

171
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,257
Think.

172
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,457
Logically.

173
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:52,428
I mean, Sheila is professional
and meticulous

174
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,981
and wonderfully anal,

175
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,766
and if she says that nothing gets misplaced

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,985
in her inner sanctum, then I believe her,

177
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,071
which leaves the national security option.

178
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,276
Is Mike Ross CIA?

179
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,944
[Scoffs] Please.

180
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,696
There's a better chance
that Esther's in the KGB.

181
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,114
I mean, I can ask Sheila,

182
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:14,000
if I'm no longer fond
of my testicles, which...

183
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,003
wait a second,
missing testicles, missing file.

184
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,990
It can't be missing if it doesn't exist.

185
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:24,660
Holy shit.

186
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,597
What if Mike Ross never went
to Harvard at all?

187
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:31,134
What if he just went to some
crappy third-tier law school,

188
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:34,687
like Fordham or Arizona State?

189
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,439
"Yeah, hey, bro.

190
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,191
"Yeah, no, I'll see you at the party.

191
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,665
"I'm not going to study for the bar.

192
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,644
"Damn straight, that's right,
bros before hos.

193
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,346
Oh, yeah, you know..."
all right, that's enough.

194
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:49,285
He's been peeing directly into
our pristine pool of eliteness.

195
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,905
He's been... oh, shoot,
it's blinking out.

196
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,072
Norma, really quickly,

197
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,824
I need you to get a pack
of rechargeable AAA...

198
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:55,992
shit, it's out.

199
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:59,362
So I guess I'm just talking to myself.

200
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,999
Harvey convinced me, so let's get to it.

201
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,802
- I want a relocation fee.
- Done.

202
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,170
And a 10% increase on my signing bonus.

203
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,838
7%.

204
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,139
You gave Harvey 10%.

205
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:12,725
Do you think you're worth
as much as Harvey?

206
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,876
I'm less of a pain in the ass.

207
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,512
10% it is.

208
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,147
Now, no one ever opens with the big stuff,

209
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:20,149
so why don't you tell me
what you're really after?

210
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:22,018
You know what I'm after.

211
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,654
The name of the firm is Pearson Specter.

212
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,906
It's changed too many times, and
it's not going to change again.

213
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,692
Never?

214
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,194
I never say never.

215
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,830
- That's all I'm looking for.
- Of course.

216
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:37,367
After all, who knows where any
of us will be in a few years?

217
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,235
You, me, Harvey.

218
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,237
I think we just changed the subject.

219
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,456
We did.

220
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:47,176
Now it's time for me to tell you
what I'm really after.

221
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,796
You want to know how committed
I am to Harvey.

222
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:53,683
I want to know how committed you are to me.

223
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,918
- How serious are you?
- About what?

224
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,021
Me.

225
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,389
We had this conversation.

226
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:00,723
We had this conversation

227
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,475
before it was going to cost me $500,000.

228
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:06,229
Jessica's making you pay
the buy-in up front?

229
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,730
- Yep.
- Sh...

230
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,198
What did you say?

231
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,283
Well, I said I don't want to have to pay

232
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,318
a Harvey-Specter-girlfriend tax.

233
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:13,453
You're not exactly paying a tax.

234
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,904
You're just buying in early.

235
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,873
Harvey, there's a reason
that firms are designed to have

236
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,074
a six-month trial period.

237
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,628
Yeah, to see if it's going to work out.

238
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,294
- Exactly.
- Which you don't think it will.

239
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,611
I'm saying that I need to know

240
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,081
what "I want you in my life" really means.

241
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,283
You know what it means.

242
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,785
It means I want to have a relationship.

243
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,256
But it doesn't mean that
I'm ready to give you a ring.

244
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,807
You think I'm ready for a ring from you?

245
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,292
Then what are you ready for?

246
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,794
I'm ready for it not
to cost me a $1/2 million

247
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,396
if it doesn't work out.

248
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,148
So if it doesn't, are you
saying you're going to leave?

249
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,599
Would you want me to stay?

250
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,802
I don't even know what
you're gonna do to break us up.

251
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,905
Harvey, I'm not kidding.
I'm...

252
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,026
I'm scared.

253
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:54,327
You know, I just got an offer

254
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,079
from Latham & Watkins in Chicago,

255
00:09:56,113 --> 00:10:00,616
and I don't want to take it, but...

256
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,452
I need to know that
you're serious about this.

257
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,788
Scottie, I am.

258
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:09,325
Yeah, but nobody's asking you
to put up $1/2 million.

259
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,427
Maybe we can make it

260
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:14,714
so nobody's asking you to do that either.

261
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,470
Rinaldi.

262
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,442
You remember me?

263
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:27,777
James and Nina Ross.

264
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,896
That's good.

265
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:33,282
Finally know my parents' names.

266
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,867
What you maybe don't know
is that I'm a lawyer,

267
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,319
I work for Pearson Specter,

268
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:39,355
and we're not going to be
settling this Foreman suit.

269
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,356
We had an agreement.

270
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,959
Yeah, maybe, but instead,

271
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:46,212
we're gonna be filing this.

272
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,916
There's no way you're getting
this case dismissed.

273
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,801
You know, I actually wanted
to believe that whole sob story

274
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,219
about being reformed, but...

275
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,222
My client is a widow, not a drunk driver.

276
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,706
Oh, so you don't actually
bully the little guy anymore,

277
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:58,891
you just try and capitalize on him.

278
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,393
Do you even know the details of this case,

279
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,844
or are you just coming after us
because I'm on the other side?

280
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,212
No, I'm coming after you

281
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,047
because you're
a worthless ambulance chaser,

282
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,066
and I'm not gonna let you take
my client's money.

283
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,551
This is the second time
you've come after me

284
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:09,569
from out of the blue.

285
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,686
I apologized to you once.

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,388
I will not apologize to you again.

287
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,490
You don't have to.

288
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,775
And we're not going to court,

289
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,911
because I'm gonna prove
you're full of shit.

290
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:24,945
You ready for the deposition?

291
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,413
Yeah, of course I'm ready.

292
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:27,998
- Your fly is unzipped.
- No, it's not.

293
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,333
[Chuckles] Didn't even flinch.

294
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,384
That means you're ready.

295
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:31,735
Then why are you still walking with me?

296
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,170
'Cause I'm coming to your deposition.

297
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,505
What?
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

298
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:35,806
You said that I could take this case.

299
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,508
You told me I could kick this guy's ass.

300
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,976
It's my deposition, not yours.

301
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,644
- I know.
- You know?

302
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,846
Why are you babysitting me?
I'm not babysitting you.

303
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,047
I want to watch you kill this guy.

304
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:45,349
That's why I brought snacks.

305
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,063
You can't bring peanuts into my deposition.

306
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,685
- Why?
- It's unprofessional.

307
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,320
So is that tie,
but I've made my peace with it.

308
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:51,488
Look, I don't give a shit

309
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:52,856
whether you made your peace with it or not.

310
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,074
You want in my room?

311
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:55,659
You're not bringing peanuts.

312
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:58,579
You really are ready.

313
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:00,730
Here.

314
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,868
What's this?

315
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:07,254
Harvey's interviews
the day Mike Ross was hired.

316
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:10,674
But Mike Ross isn't on it.

317
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,042
Where'd you get this?

318
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,910
Doesn't matter where I got it.
The fact is I did.

319
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,846
Are you asking me
why Mike Ross isn't on it?

320
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,382
Yeah, Donna, that's
precisely what I'm asking.

321
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,917
How exactly did Harvey find him?

322
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,303
We didn't find him, he found us.

323
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:24,521
What are you talking about?

324
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,557
[Sighs]

325
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:29,902
Mike hadn't signed up
for the interview on time,

326
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,061
so he pretended to be

327
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,147
one of the other associates on the list.

328
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,698
He talked his way past me

329
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:36,099
and impressed the shit out of Harvey,

330
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:37,618
whose main requirement was
somebody who had the balls

331
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:39,369
to do something like that
in the first place.

332
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,405
Okay.

333
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,717
What if he had the balls to do something

334
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:46,627
a lot bigger than that?

335
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,378
What are you talking about?

336
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:49,779
I think Mike Ross went
to a subpar law school

337
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:51,281
and has been lying about it the whole time.

338
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,001
Louis, listen to yourself.
You're talking about Mike.

339
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:55,219
You're insane.

340
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:57,888
I'm...

341
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,474
Okay, I was in the Harvard
file room with Sheila.

342
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:02,259
Don't ask details.

343
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:06,146
And I noticed Mike Ross' file
was not there.

344
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:09,299
You specifically looked for his file?

345
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,517
Yes, and I looked for Harvey's too,

346
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:11,768
and his was there.

347
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:13,437
And by the way,
he looked like a major douche.

348
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,439
So you looked at a grand total of two files

349
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:16,773
out of tens of thousands,

350
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,660
and this is the conclusion you jump to?

351
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:20,744
What is wrong with you?

352
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,246
You don't know Sheila.

353
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,997
She's like a surgeon,
and the files are her patients.

354
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,115
She doesn't make mistakes.

355
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,835
- You told her about this?
- Hell no.

356
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,837
She told me not to touch
any of those files,

357
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:31,205
and she'd kill me
if she found out that I did.

358
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,696
I just asked her about it generally.

359
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:35,425
Well, of course she's
gonna say she never loses one,

360
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,127
but I can tell you
from personal experience,

361
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:40,497
anything can happen to a file.

362
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:41,882
I don't know.

363
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,219
Well, I do. I know Mike,
and I know he's for real.

364
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,387
But if you still doubt it,
there's an easy answer.

365
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:50,340
Just call up Harvard and ask
for a copy of his transcript.

366
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:53,393
And what if it's not there?

367
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:56,530
Then I will apologize
for calling you insane

368
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:00,033
and personally help you escort
Mike Ross out of the building.

369
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:06,957
Good-bye.

370
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:09,293
In 2002, you were sued
for the malfunctioning

371
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,888
of an earlier model of the heart stent.

372
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:11,995
Is that correct?

373
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,863
Yes, and we admitted wrongdoing.

374
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:16,717
The stent that was installed
in your patient was a new model

375
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,304
developed through three years
of extensive trials.

376
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,506
Making it outside the scope,
and frankly, not a good argument

377
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,840
for establishing pattern.

378
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,042
They saw a problem, and they fixed it.

379
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,711
How horrible, we should sue them.

380
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,012
We're not in court.

381
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:30,564
Opening statements are made before a judge,

382
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:32,159
or have you never been in court before?

383
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,504
I just wanted to give you a taste,

384
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,186
seeing as we're never
actually gonna get there.

385
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,439
A dismissal is never gonna happen, son.

386
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,362
Sorry for your loss, son.

387
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:46,530
What?

388
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm saying, don't hope for a dismissal.

389
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,668
Please direct your questions to our client.

390
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:53,403
That wasn't a question.
It was a comment.

391
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:55,672
Here's a question for you,
Mr. Dimond.

392
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:57,207
What is this really worth to you?

393
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,009
You may think you have a defense.

394
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,378
Your lawyer certainly thinks you do.

395
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,213
But I just want to be clear
about the facts.

396
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,049
What is this really worth to you?

397
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,769
There's no question,
this was a terrible accident.

398
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,354
But let's be clear about the facts.

399
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:16,026
His blood alcohol level is an issue here.

400
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,394
If you pursue this in court,

401
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,062
there's no guarantee
you'll receive anything.

402
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,198
Think about the boy.

403
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:23,200
Think about what he needs.

00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,102

[Pen clicking]

407
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:36,663
Stop stalling, Mr. Ross.

408
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,086
- Um, I...
- He's not stalling.

409
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,088
And we're under no obligation

410
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,257
to disclose trials from an earlier model.

411
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,892
It's beyond the scope.

412
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,510
Our expert will place
that study within the scope.

413
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,511
Um, uh...

414
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:52,962
If there isn't a trial,

415
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,631
your expert won't have
any scope to place it in.

416
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,683
And since you insist on asking questions

417
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,485
we're under no obligation to answer,

418
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,021
this deposition is over.

419
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:06,777
What the hell happened in there?

420
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,645
You said you wanted to watch,
not hijack my case.

421
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,414
You said you were going to kick his ass,

422
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:11,581
not drift
into never-never land.

423
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,500
- I'm handling it.
- Handling it?

424
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:14,868
I could've eaten that whole bag of peanuts

425
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,153
in the pause you took
to answer that question.

426
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,289
You got thrown, and I bailed you out.

427
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:20,757
Harvey, this is my case.

428
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,126
This is not your case.
It's the client's case.

429
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,494
And after what happened in there,

430
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,346
they're in a worse position
than when we started.

431
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:28,498
Look, I know I got thrown,
but I can still recover.

432
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,500
Maybe, but they're gonna call
in a half an hour

433
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:31,802
wanting to take the deal,

434
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,337
and when they do,
I'm gonna buy you one day,

435
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:37,357
and then I'm pulling the plug.

436
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,909
Hey, do you have a minute?

437
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,994
- I'm a little busy right now.
- We have a problem.

438
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:48,196
Scottie's not going to be a problem.

439
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:51,500
I thought it through...
Louis might be onto Mike.

440
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:56,231
He found out that Mike doesn't have a file

441
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,639
in the Harvard file room

442
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,008
and that he wasn't
on your original interview list.

443
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,143
What did you tell him?

444
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,511
Well, I handled the list.

445
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,730
- What about the other?
- What could I tell him?

446
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,214
I mean, I told him if he was so curious,

447
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:08,150
he could order a copy of Mike's transcript.

448
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,884
Then we don't have a problem.

449
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,738
Well, don't you think maybe
we should do something else?

450
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,056
Anything else is just going
to make him more suspicious.

451
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:17,359
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

452
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:18,827
Okay.

453
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:19,828
Oh, wait a second.

454
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:21,229
Where did you say Louis was again?

455
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,748
Oh, he was in the Harvard file room.

456
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:23,916
How was he in the Harvard file room?

457
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,234
He has a relationship with Sheila Sazs.

Yeah, I don't need food.

to this dismissal hearing tomorrow.

467
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,698
Mike, it was a pretty decent settlement.

468
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,933
Would it really be so bad to just take it?

they were celebrating

the anniversary of their first date.

One sip two hours before his
stent supposedly malfunctioned.

626

Alcohol was strictly forbidden
following his surgery,

627

which makes him liable for his own death.

You can't prove this caused anything.

00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:04,489
Imagine that, Mike Ross went to Harvard.

644
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:06,524
What a shocker.
You were right.

645
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,627
Never should have doubted it.

646
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:10,996
You know, it's just hard to imagine a world

647
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,464
in which Sheila made a mistake, though.

648
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:14,132
Well, it's just good
you can put this to bed

649
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,167
once and for all.

650
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:17,169
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

651
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,870
If Sheila's competence
is that important to her,

652
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:23,392
I need to tell her about this,
so she can fix it.

653
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,542
You know what, Louis?

654
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,511
It occurred to me after we talked

655
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,897
that I'm the only one who has
the list of associates

656
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,732
that interviewed with Harvey that day.

657
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,185
That can't be right,

658
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:35,520
'cause I got a copy off the general server.

659
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:36,738
You got a copy by bullying Benjamin

660
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:39,057
into accessing my private files
off my hard drive.

661
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:41,059
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Louis...

662
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:42,577
Okay, I did it, but that was
only 'cause I was concerned.

663
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:45,697
So your concern gives you
the right to invade my privacy?

664
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:48,166
I... what?
No, it was just a file.

665
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,068
How dare you?

666
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:52,004
You pretend to be this gallant man.

667
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,406
You make a big show of how you
would never cross into my area

668
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:55,540
without my permission.

669
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:57,259
I am gallant, and I would never dare.

670
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:59,344
You wouldn't dare, because
you'd have to do it to my face.

671
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,630
But you have no problem breaking
my trust behind my back,

672
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,748
and that not only pisses me off,

673
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:06,468
but it makes me question...

674
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,920
Whether I want to have
a relationship with you at all.

675
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:11,756
I'm so sorry, Donna.

676
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,275
No, Louis, you know what...

677
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,528
- No, no, no, Donna, I'm sorry.
- No, I can't.

678
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:17,863
- No, no, no, no.
- I can't... I can't even...

679
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:19,931
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, shh! Don't speak.

680
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:23,101
I cannot even look at you right now.

681
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,602
And I don't even know
why I'm gonna tell you this,

682
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,154
but if you pissed me off that much,

683
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,406
what do you think Sheila's gonna do

684
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,275
when you tell her you violated her trust?

685
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:33,078
Huh?

686
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:35,464
You're right.

687
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:36,948
Thank you, Donna,

688
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:40,502
for putting your anger on hold
long enough to help me salvage

689
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:42,888
the single most important
non-feline relationship

690
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:45,757
of my life.

691
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:01,406
- Someone's been a bad boy.
- Sheila.

692
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,407
You thought I wouldn't find out?

693
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,476
I hoped you wouldn't.

694
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:10,648
If you wanted a pair of my underwear,

695
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,918
you should have just asked.

696
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,319
Oh, that, Sheila.

697
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:16,321
God, what are you doing here?

698
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:18,373
Aren't you happy I'm here?

699
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:20,759
[Laughing nervously] Of course, absolutely.

700
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:23,211
- You don't seem happy.
- I'm overjoyed.

701
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:24,963
I'm just, you know...
I'm just surprised.

702
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:27,265
But you're all nervous and sweaty.

703
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,134
Come on, you know
my sweat ducts get excited

704
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:30,668
when they see you.
Good.

705
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:32,837
Because your sweat ducts are
going to be working overtime.

706
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,439
What?

707
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,860
The Chilton, room 305, tonight.

708
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:41,897
[Both chuckle] [Kisses]

709
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,071
[Sighs]

710
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:53,358
You didn't have to come

711
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:54,826
all the way over here
just to drop the case.

712
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,796
I came here to tell you
you're doing the wrong thing.

713
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,917
I don't need a lecture
from you on right and wrong.

714
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,335
You once asked me how I live with myself.

715
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:06,555
Well, somewhere along the way,
I realized I had a choice

716
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:08,557
not to be on the side
that made me feel like shit.

717
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:11,709
You're on that side now.
Yeah, I don't feel like shit.

718
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,645
That's because you're telling
yourself you're doing your job.

719
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,230
And I'm telling you
that you're bullying someone

720
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:16,431
who deserves your sympathy.

721
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:19,518
You really want to play the bullying card?

722
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:21,236
My grandmother lost her only son.

723
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,720
You used her grief against her.

724
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:24,523
This has nothing to do with that.

725
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,658
Look, I know, you need me
to be the villain...

726
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:27,659
No, no, no, no, no.

727
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:29,411
You are the villain.

728
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:33,031
Well, then congratulations,
because you just became me.

729
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:38,036
What are you talking about?

730
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:44,009
Your father had two drinks
on the night he was killed.

731
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:45,677
That was the reason I was able
to get your grandmother

732
00:28:45,711 --> 00:28:47,295
to settle.

733
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:00,225
It's not every day I get off the elevator

734
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:03,695
and find someone in my firm
that makes me look short.

735
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:06,064
So you've seen our newest client?

736
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:07,599
You mean Scottie's newest client.

737
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:09,317
Michael Phelps may be her client,

738
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:11,269
but we're gonna get Speedo.

739
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,539
And why should that make me change my mind?

740
00:29:14,574 --> 00:29:16,374
Because their fee
is worth more than her buy-in.

741
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:19,544
You still think this is about money.

742
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,447
I told this to Scottie, and now
I'm going to tell it to you.

743
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:25,133
We've had too much turnover.

744
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,451
We can't have any more.

745
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:28,620
Jessica, I'm telling you she's in.

746
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:30,121
Then she shouldn't have
any problem putting her money

747
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,223
where her mouth is.

748
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:32,474
It's not right.

749
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:36,127
Harvey, it's time you and I had the talk.

750
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:37,429
I know where babies come from.

751
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:39,814
But do you know how couples stay together?

752
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,299
What are you getting at?

753
00:29:41,317 --> 00:29:43,485
When Daniel and I took over the firm,

754
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,403
we had a heart-to-heart.

755
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:47,739
He had a philosophy
that I agreed to live by.

756
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:49,107
Daniel was a piece of shit.

757
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:53,411
Doesn't mean his philosophy was.

758
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,863
I'm listening.

759
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:57,482
He told me, for a partnership to work,

760
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,669
there has to be trust between
number one and number two.

761
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:02,671
You don't have to agree with me,

762
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:05,257
but you have to trust that I listen to you,

763
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,958
that my decisions are reasoned,

764
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:08,960
and that I am doing what I think is right.

765
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:10,011
Jessica...

766
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:11,463
You can't have two presidents, Harvey.

767
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:13,465
Now I chose to trust you when you said

768
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,060
you didn't want to be managing partner.

769
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,301
Was that true or not?

770
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:17,435
It was.

771
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,304
Then I need you to accept this.

772
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:21,673
What if I had an idea

773
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:24,809
where maybe we can both get what we want?

774
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,013
I'm listening.

775
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,354
That's never happened to me before.

776
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:38,022
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

777
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,575
<i>Black Hawk Down.</i>

778
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:42,410
First of all,

779
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:44,028
that's an amazing movie,
and you should be proud

780
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:45,880
that you are associated with it.

781
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:48,383
And second of all, I think
I know what the problem is.

782
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,202
You do?

783
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,840
It's about what happened in the file room.

784
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,009
Listen, Sheila, I can't tell you

785
00:30:58,043 --> 00:30:59,043
how that's been weighing on my mind.

786
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:01,212
No, I get it.

787
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,233
Now that we've declared our love,

788
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:07,719
you think of me as a good girl.

789
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:09,688
And you need me to be bad.

790
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:12,073
- What?
- It happens all the time.

791
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:15,026
We're in a relationship now,
and you think that changes

792
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,029
the nature of our sexual relationship.

793
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:20,615
But I am here to assure you...

794
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:21,916
I can be bad.

795
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,668
Okay, that's not actually what...

796
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:24,736
Liar.

797
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:25,837
Whoa.

798
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:27,539
Take it easy.

799
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,341
I am being serious right now.

800
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:32,076
You think I'm not being serious?

801
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:35,296
I'm deadly serious.
Ow.

00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:29,175
Because I told you that.

964
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,712
You know I don't listen
when you say things.

965
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:37,050
You are an asshole.

966
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,801
This is good.

967
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:41,020
Honesty is good.

968
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,722
I told Rebecca Carlin you were gay.

969
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,524
She slept with me anyway.

970
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:47,093
Once.

971
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,194
Yeah.

972
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:50,196
Why did she only sleep with me once?

973
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:53,650
Because I also told her that you had crabs.

974
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:57,103
- That's not cool.
- [Laughs]

975
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:00,940
This is good.

976
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,442
It is.

977
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,496
I am in this, Scottie.

978
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,115
Okay.

979
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,801
So am I.

980
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:17,473
Well, let's see what you got,
Michael James Ross.

981
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,142
Magna cum laude.

982
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:20,727
[Chuckles]

983
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:23,462
So Mr. Smarty Pants couldn't
even manage summa cum laude?

984
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,767
Yeah, well, so what if I couldn't either?

985
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,485
What? No <i>Law Review?</i>

986
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,854
Well, either you weren't asked,
or you didn't serve.

987
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,190
Either way, I win.

988
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,359
"A."

989
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,411
"A."

990
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,496
B-plus in International Law?

991
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:44,417
Oh, come on, I aced that class
with my eyes closed.

992
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,369
"A" in contracts.
That's legit.

993
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,623
A-minus in Estate Planning?

994
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:53,793
Remind me to not die intestate
with Mike Ross around.

995
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:07,390
[Knock on door]

996
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,058
Tape measure, as requested.

997
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,443
You look really excited.

998
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,145
- Long day.
- I know.

999
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,313
Is there any chance we can punt this,

1000
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:14,647
maybe go grab some dinner?

1001
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:19,235
We could, or we could accept
that moving in together

1002
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:24,190
sometimes means we have to
just shake off our crappy days

1003
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,659
and deal with things
like furniture negotiations.

1004
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:27,827
Yeah, that doesn't sound

1005
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,341
like anything I want to accept at all.

1006
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,863
Too bad.

1007
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:33,666
This is your life now.

1008
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,969
Rachel, look, I'm trying...

1009
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:43,542
You said that your dad liked
to celebrate the little things,

1010
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,512
and I thought maybe we
should start doing that too.

1011
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:49,182
You mean like furniture negotiations?

1012
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:53,653
Mmm, I mean our first date.

1013
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:55,321
So does that mean I'm not
gonna be able to eat anything?

1014
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:57,573
'Cause I didn't like anything
on the menu that night.

1015
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:00,026
That wasn't our first date.

1016
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,414
Our first date was in the law library.

1017
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:07,500
- Sushi.
- Sushi.

1018
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:09,669
That was my first case.

1019
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,671
[Laughing] I know.

1020
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:14,424
Oh, you were so green.
[Chuckles]

1021
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,342
Harvey came in and told us
to stop playing footsie.

1022
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:17,760
Oh, I remember that.

1023
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,912
I wanted to do a lot more
than play footsie with you.

1024
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,014
I know.

1025
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:22,465
I caught you staring at me five times.

1026
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:24,050
Oh, so I guess you didn't
catch all the other times then.

1027
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:26,269
No I did, just trying to let you
off the hook.

1028
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:29,522
Rachel...

1029
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,590
This is perfect.

1030
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,393
Not yet.

1031
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,533
[Laughs]

1032
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,236
Now it is.

1033
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,487
So where's the chair?

1034
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:45,988
No.

1035
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,940
[Both laugh]

1036
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:54,213
You wanted to see me?

1037
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:57,116
Professor Gerard's
legal ethics class... you take it?

1038
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,451
Of course, everyone had to take it.

1039
00:41:58,469 --> 00:41:59,469
What'd you get?

1040
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:02,455
Killed it.
I got an A-minus.

1041
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:03,723
Out of curiosity,

1042
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,475
did you ever hear of anybody
ever getting an A-plus?

1043
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:07,226
What? No.

1044
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,978
He's famous for never
giving higher than an "A."

1045
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:10,430
He doesn't believe in it.

1046
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:13,466
Thank you, Simon.
That'll be all.

1047
