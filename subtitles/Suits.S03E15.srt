1
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:03,822
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:05,201
will you marry me?

3
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,237
Yes, I will marry you.

4
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:08,505
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.

5
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,440
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

6
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,509
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

7
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:14,110
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

8
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,712
you don't move
the goddamn body.

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,580
Harvey, I'm stuck.

10
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:19,816
I can't live my whole life
like this.

11
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:21,851
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

12
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,220
I want you to join
my new corporation.

13
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:26,756
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

14
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,725
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

15
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,794
Scottie, I need you to give
Louis his transaction back.

16
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:34,697
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

17
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:37,767
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.

18
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:39,035
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing

19
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,703
everything with each other
after all.

20
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,938
- Scottie.
- You can't have it

21
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,439
both ways, Harvey.

22
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,775
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?

23
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,310
I don't like kids.

24
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:50,213
I was willing to give up Harvard
for you.

25
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,649
You can't give up something
for me?

26
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,591
I understand.
Can I just say something please?

27
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,862
I know you keep saying that
I won't feel this way forever,

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,098
but why is it
when the guys shows up

29
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,867
with chicken vindaloo
40 minutes late

30
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:13,870
with no naan
and no silverware,

31
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,905
instead of throwing the chutney
in his face,

32
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:18,875
I'm thanking him
and I am tipping him $20?

33
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:22,979
Do you want to tell me
why that happens?

34
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,548
I don't care.
I hate myself.

35
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,383
I hate my life.

36
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,652
The woman I love is gone,
my heart is broken,

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,187
and I really--
to be honest with you,

38
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:33,022
I just don't have
the will to live.

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,059
[Beeps]

40
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,895
Hold on.
It's my associate.

41
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:39,963
Katrina.

42
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,965
Louis, it's 7:55.

43
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,366
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.

44
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,902
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything,

45
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,137
and unless the building
is on fire and Sheila's in it,

46
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,039
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?

47
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,240
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

48
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:52,408
My heart's been shattered

49
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:53,716
into a thousand million pieces,

50
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:55,211
and if I can't put my heart
into my work,

51
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,614
then I'm not gonna do
any work at all, so...

52
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,449
How long do you think
you'll be out?

53
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,050
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow,

54
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,552
the rest of the year.

55
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,820
You know,
just don't call here again

56
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:07,023
because I'm not gonna answer
the number.

57
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,792
Doc?

58
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,395
Dr. Lipschitz?

59
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:15,031
Hello?

60
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,034
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.

61
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:34,884
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.

62
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:37,286
I called you three times.
I had to do something.

63
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,489
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.

64
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:43,693
What for?
You're just doing your job.

65
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,195
Scottie, I'm sorry.

66
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,898
What happened with Louis,
I didn't like doing it.

67
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,100
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now

68
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,735
is asking you to let it go.

69
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,504
Harvey, it's not that you
picked Louis over me.

70
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,938
It's that you wouldn't
tell me why.

71
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:58,841
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.

72
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,113
And I'm asking you
to trust me.

73
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,683
Okay.

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,752
I can let it go,
but keeping things from me

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,556
just can't keep happening,
okay?

76
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:15,692
I can't tell you
whether or not that's okay,

77
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,396
and I definitely
can't tell you why.

78
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:22,131
Too soon?

79
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,833
What are you going to do
to make it up to me?

80
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,368
Nothing right now.

81
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,870
I'm taking Mike
to the marathon footwear brunch.

82
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,499
You're taking a date
to an I.P.O. event?

83
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,107
That's so cute.
It's not a date.

84
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,542
He's never gonna put out.

85
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,943
Well, it's too bad
that you're not taking me

86
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,846
because I was thinking
of letting you...

87
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:39,849
[Whispers indistinctly]

88
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:48,124
Mr. Specter.

89
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:49,525
James Quelling.

90
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:51,394
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
Mr. Quelling.

91
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,896
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.

92
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:56,733
Yeah, you do, unless you want
Friday's headline to read,

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,736
"Marathon Footwear builds
playgrounds that kill children."

94
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,537
My client builds playgrounds
that help children.

95
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:04,640
And uses a synthetic
full of toxins to do it.

96
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,743
Look, I don't know
who you are,

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,210
but I know what you're trying
to do, and it isn't gonna work.

98
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:10,646
Look,
I'm a reasonable man.

99
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,615
This is a huge moment
for your client.

100
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,817
I won't file this
before Friday.

101
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:17,186
You think I'm gonna let you
extort my client?

102
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:19,789
No, I think you're gonna
protect your client

103
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,657
from a claim
that could ruin them.

104
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:26,763
In fact,
I'm counting on it.

105
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,098
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.

106
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:33,936
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit. From who?

107
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:35,571
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.

108
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,573
But I thought Louis
was his lawyer.

109
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:39,709
He doesn't want me
to be his lawyer.

110
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:43,379
He wants me to be a partner.

111
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,548
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:46,916
- And?
- I don't know.

113
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,184
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

114
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,920
What do you think?
I think that I love you,

115
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:54,891
and what you want to do
is what I want you to do.

116
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,959
I don't know what to do.

117
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:59,495
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?

118
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,364
If I do that,
all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,

119
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,498
"thanks for doing everything
for me.

120
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,333
I'm thinking about quitting."
Well...

121
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,835
No, but you said
that you don't think of him

122
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,670
as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.

123
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,739
- So?
- So if he can't have

124
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:13,009
an honest conversation with
your best interests in mind,

125
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:16,913
he's not your friend, and--
and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you
about something.

137
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:58,677
Well, unless its value
is in excess of $575 million,

138
00:05:58,745 --> 00:05:59,879
it can wait.

139
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,247
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.

140
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:03,582
Good because our I.P.O.
is in jeopardy

141
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,085
unless we can deal
with this.

142
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:08,888
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.

143
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,422
This is a bullshit claim.

144
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,891
Maybe, but a bullshit claim

145
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,478
on the right day is better than
a great claim on a bullshit day.

146
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,328
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?

147
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,530
My grandmother
taught it to me.

148
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,299
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find

149
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,407
everything there is to know
about this Quelling guy.

150
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,371
Harvey, why don't you
just pay him off?

151
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:26,505
Protect the I.P.O.?

152

I worked my ass off
for this day.

153

He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted

154
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,510
by some piece of shit
I've never heard of.

00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:33,812
Okay. On it.

156
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,748
Jessica.

157
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:37,449
Donna,
what can I do for you?

158
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:39,184
I was just walking
by reception,

159
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:40,719
and I thought you might
like to know--you know,

160
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,488
because it's your firm and--
Donna, get to it.

161
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,924
Charles Van Dyke
is in the lobby.

162
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,393
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.

163
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,594
You were right
to come to me.

164
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:49,929
Would you like me
to send him on his way?

165
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:52,064
I prefer to take care
of Charles Van Dyke myself.

166
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,066
Excellent.

167
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,673
You can stare at it
all you want, Charles,

168
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,241
but it's not going to change.

169
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,542
I was just thinking,

170
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,844
"I can't believe you put
the mailroom boy's name

171
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,446
on the wall."
I think what you mean is

172
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,648
that you can't believe
yours was ever taken off.

173
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:11,150
I put that behind me
years ago.

174
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,497
What are you doing here,
Charles?

175
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,188
I suggest we go
in your office and talk.

176
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:19,191
Right here is just fine.

177
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,426
What do you want?

178
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,695
I want a 30% increase
in my dividend check.

179
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:25,864
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.

180
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,434
This is formal notice of
my demand to audit your books.

181
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,602
You have until Friday
to comply.

182
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,539
You gave up this right
when we ran you out of town.

183
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:36,041
I think you're forgetting
I retain that right

184
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:39,044
in the event of any
material change in my dividend.

185
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,679
Your dividend went up.

186
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:44,616
Materially.

187
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,452
You think
we're hiding profits.

188
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,688
From what I know of you,
you're always hiding something.

189
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,660
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.

190
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,028
That's not what your ex-wife
calls you.

191
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,196
She calls you Jim.

192
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:59,164
That's one of the nicer names
she uses.

193
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:01,200
She's been calling you
a lot these days.

194
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,068
Wow, you found out
I'm divorced.

195
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:04,937
Well, I'll withdraw
the lawsuit.

196
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:07,172
It's not the divorce, Jimbo,
it's the huge wall

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,575
of mounting debt
that's closing in on you

198
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,377
since you tanked
the tobacco litigation.

199
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,278
I didn't tank it.
I lost.

200
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:14,613
You didn't just lose.

201
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,482
You had an offer that
would have set you up for life.

202
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:18,417
Instead, you rolled the dice,
went to verdict,

203
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:19,785
and now you got nothing.

204
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:21,453
Which is why your wife
left you,

205
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:24,523
and now you're coming after us
with a fabricated claim.

206
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,992
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.

207
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,595
You've got one report
of possible toxins

208
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,930
in the playground material.
And not one sick child.

209
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:33,899
And you have an I.P.O.
on Friday,

210
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,068
and if this suit appears
in the <i>Journal</i> that morning,

211
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,536
what do you think
the stock price is gonna be

212
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:41,707
when they ring that bell?

213
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:44,176
Got me.
Give me your number.

214
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:47,813
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.

215
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:51,316
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.

216
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,719
But one thing,
this precludes you

217
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:57,489
from representing any other
plaintiffs with the same action.

218
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:01,660
[Laughs]
You got me.

219
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:03,962
I have 100 other plaintiffs
waiting in the wings.

220
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,066
That's a $10 million hit
you just avoided.

221
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,300
I tell you what.

222
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,469
Give me a million,
and we're really done.

223
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,672
James, this covers your debts
and gets you out from under.

224
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:19,711
You think that means I'm gonna
take less than it's worth?

225
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,848
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.

226
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,851
You know where to reach me.

227
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,455
Thought you said
you were willing to go

228
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:31,290
as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before

229
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:33,659
I realized
what we were dealing with.

230
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,895
This guy doesn't owe money
'cause he got divorced.

231
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,430
He got divorced
'cause he owes money.

232
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:40,339
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.

233
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,934
How does that help us?

234
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,936
He doesn't know I'm one.

235
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,878
Where's Louis?

236
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:54,613
- Jessica.
- Where is he?

237
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:58,083
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.

238
00:09:58,151 --> 00:09:59,751
The thing is
I don't know if he--

239
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:02,721
Katrina,
your job as gatekeeper

240
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,224
does not apply to me,
so I'm going to ask you

241
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,291
one more time.

242
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,294
Why isn't Louis
in the building?

243
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:10,596
He must still be in court.

244
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:12,865
Is there something I can do?
What you can do

245
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,033
is find Louis and have him
come up with a way around

246
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,136
this demand
to look at our books.

247
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:18,564
When should I tell him
you need it?

248
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:21,974
Yesterday.

249
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,676
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.

250
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:27,012
- What night?
- Every night.

251
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,241
Well, I hope you know where
tonight's game is because--

252
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:33,952
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,356
You and I are going.

254
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,791
- Um...
- What?

255
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:47,032
I got a job offer,
Harvey.

256
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,535
Supposed to go have drinks
to talk about it tonight.

257
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,271
I can move it,
it's just, that's...

258
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:55,574
that's why I hesitated.

259
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,709
- When?
- When what?

260
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,044
When'd you get
the job offer?

261
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:00,953
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.

262
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,014
I didn't know
what I thought.

263
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,682
- And now you do?
- No. It's--

264
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,952
Who?

265
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,321
Jonathan Sidwell.

266
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:10,489
The spin-off idea?

267
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:12,090
- Yeah.
- I should have known.

268
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,026
He wants you to be
his general counsel?

269
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:18,397
No, he wants to make me
an investment banker.

270
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:23,835
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.

271
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:26,905
What? Why?

272
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,807
Because you can compete there
like you do here

273
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,576
with nothing hanging
over your head.

274
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:32,110
What if I don't want to stop
being a lawyer?

275
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:33,338
Well, then don't
take the job.

276
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,646
I mean, what do you want
from me?

277
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,315
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.

278
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:38,984
No, you told me
what you would do.

279
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,986
I want to know what you think
I should do.

280
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:43,555
Mike, last week,
you said you'd do anything

281
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:48,660
to stop being a fraud,
so my advice is take it.

282
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:51,463
Still be in the majors,
just be a different sport.

283
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,135
[Clears throat]

284
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,017
Excuse me,
do you have a minute?

285
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,537
Look, you and I have never--

286
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:10,340
No, we haven't.

287
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:11,574
I need your help.

288
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:13,409
You must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel

289
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,511
if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.

290
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,815
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.

291
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,650
It's worse than awful.

292
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,452
Jessica needs him on a case
right now.

293
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,088
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.

294
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,089
Then I'll just go over there
right now.

295
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,390
That won't work.

296
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,225
Even if it did,
we don't have time.

297
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:32,262
So then why are you here?

298
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,410
Rachel, you don't trust me.

299
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:37,033
I get that,
but Louis asked me

300
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,736
to cover for him, and that
is what I'm going to do.

301
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:45,008
You're the best paralegal here,
and you're his friend.

302
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:48,378
So will you help me or not?
I will.

303
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:54,851
So...I figured out
what you can do

304
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,853
to make it up to me tonight.

305
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,354
I thought we were good.

306
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:01,924
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling
some residual anger.

307
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,760
Scottie, I'm kind of busy
right now,

308
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:04,961
and I have plans tonight.

309
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,696
Taking Mike
on another I.P.O. date?

310
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,364
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.

311
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:09,465
Sounds mysterious.

312
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,200
Bet you can't tell me
what it is.

313
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,336
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?

314
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:15,938
Can I come?
It's a work thing.

315
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:18,207
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.

316
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,943
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?

317
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,879
- What got into you?
- Nothing.

318
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:26,649
Sometimes at the office,
I'm working.

319
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:29,786
Fair enough, boss.

320
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,729
Are you sure that's how
you want to play that?

321
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,698
Play what,
the fact that I'm busy?

322
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:43,333
The fact that you
just snapped at her

323
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,134
when we both know what
you're really angry about.

324
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:48,371
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.

325
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,919
You're angry
that Mike wants to leave,

326
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,207
and you just
took it out on her.

327
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,976
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt,

328
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:58,181
and the anger covers the hurt,
but I knew you didn't know that.

329
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:00,616
I was annoyed
about the interruption

330
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:03,119
just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.

331
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,021
You're feeling
exactly what I'm feeling.

332
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,290
The idea of Mike leaving sucks,

333
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,825
and the sooner you get
your brain around that,

334
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:12,328
the sooner you can maybe
do something about it.

335
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,696
Can I get back to work now?

336
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,532
You can get back to work
whenever you want.

337
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,701
But if all you're gonna do
is stick your head in the sand,

338
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,870
then you're not going to have
an associate or a girlfriend

339
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:25,608
to get back to work from.

340
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:27,810
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.

341
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:29,412
She suspect anything?

342
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,515
I wouldn't be standing here
if she did.

343
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,451
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.

344
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,953
Well, she should.

345
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,554
Louis didn't just
come up with a way

346
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:40,690
to keep Charles Van Dyke
out of our books.

347
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:44,594
Louis came up with a way
to blow him out of the water.

348
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:48,564
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.

349
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:52,568
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.

350
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:59,142
Don't get used to it.

351
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,543
Don't worry.

352
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,178
I'm not looking
to work here again.

353
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,113
Not here,
but you are looking to work?

354
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:07,984
I've always been able to see
through your bullshit, Charles.

355
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:12,889
Which is why I'm offering you
these, five cases.

356
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:16,025
We're co-counsel,
split the profits 50/50.

357
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:18,694
It announces to the world
that you are back in business,

358
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,329
which is what you really want.

359
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:24,200
You came to me
bearing gifts.

360
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,435
I still have the card.

361
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:29,839
"To the man who hired me
for all you've done."

362
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,141
Two days later,
you shoved me out.

363
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,278
I take this to mean
you're passing on my offer.

364
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:36,712
I'm shitting on your offer.

365
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,648
Okay, Charles.
You were right.

366
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:42,485
Your dividend check did have
the wrong amount,

367
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,653
but from now on,
it's going to have

368
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,788
the right amount, zero.

369
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:47,757
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm

370
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:52,762
you had your exit agreement with
no longer exists.

371
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,598
We became Pearson Darby,
then Pearson Specter,

372
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,868
which means
you're not entitled to a thing.

373
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,970
That's not in the spirit
of our agreement.

374
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:03,739
And neither is your claim.

375
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,708
There's only one problem.

376
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,010
You should have dug deeper
into the fine print.

377
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:09,812
The entity referred to
in our agreement

378
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,315
is defined in your bylaws
as "any partnership

379
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:17,086
in which the name partner
is Jessica Pearson."

380
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:19,856
You didn't know.

381
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:22,825
My number just tripled.

382
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,961
Your call.

383
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,897
Our hearing is Friday.

384
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,652
You guys playing cards?

385
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,722
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.

386
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:55,858
Why don't I give it a try?

387
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,927
Buyin is 25,000.

388
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,430
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.

389
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:04,634
Maybe I am out of my league.

390
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:17,813
Raise $45,000.

391
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:20,316
I'm putting you all-in.

392
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:22,084
I've seen guys like you
before.

393
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,554
You think if you bully me
with your big stack,

394
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,355
I'm gonna run and hide.

395
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:29,258
Here's the difference
between you and me, Jimbo,

396
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,695
I lose,
I pull out another 25 grand,

397
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,263
and another 25 after that.

398
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,567
You lose,
you've got nothing.

399
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,201
You're bluffing.

400
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,538
Then call
or get up and walk away,

401
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:47,043
but I've sat across from you
1,000 times before.

402
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,111
You won't walk.

403
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,804
Tough beat.

404
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,739
Take your winnings.

405
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,608
What winnings?

406
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,615
I thought maybe it was time
we do a little negotiating.

407
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:27,149
Well, you have my offer.

408
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:28,784
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.

409
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,753
I want a 50% increase
in base salary.

410
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,223
I want a guaranteed bonus not
tied to our investment returns,

411
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,961
a four-week vacation,
and I want a piece.

412
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,497
- A piece?
- A piece.

413
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:44,667
- No.
- No piece?

414
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:48,571
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.

415
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:49,672
You can't make up your mind,

416
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,574
so you want me
to make it up for you.

417
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,722
But I don't want someone
who's with me for the money.

418
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,011
I want someone who's with me

419
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:56,212
'cause they want to kick
some ass.

420
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,780
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take

421
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:02,752
this job right now,
I will negotiate in good faith.

422
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,889
But you don't.

423
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:09,125
I don't yet.

424
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:12,128
[Clears throat]

425
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:13,829
Starting tomorrow,

426
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,498
I'll be interviewing
other people.

427
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:20,970
Once I find the right person,
job is gone.

428
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:27,777
I'm not dropping my suit when
you're going public in two days.

429
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:30,680
James, you've read
all about Hessington Oil.

430
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,682
The odds were stacked
against me.

431
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:36,252
I won anyway, because I win.

432
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,521
You won because Edward Darby
came forward.

433
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:39,855
You got lucky.

434
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:42,958
Guys like you always think
other people get lucky.

435
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:44,994
I don't get lucky.

436
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:46,495
I make my own luck,

437
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:49,665
and in this case,
it's bleeding you dry.

438
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,567
Right there.

439
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:55,504
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.

440
00:19:55,572 --> 00:20:00,109
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.

441
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:03,546
It's the exact amount
of the deal we offered you.

442
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:05,981
Sign it.

443
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,351
We'll fix the paperwork
tomorrow.

444
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:16,192
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.

445
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,661
He doesn't play anymore
the rest of the night.

446
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,361
You didn't sleep well.

447
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,395
I didn't sleep at all.

448
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:36,198
It's a big decision.

449
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,134
You still haven't told me
what you think.

450
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,503
Mike, I can't make
the decision for you.

451
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,004
I don't want you
to make it for me.

452
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:43,639
I just want to know
what you think.

453
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,274
And I already told you
that I will support you

454
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,276
with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me

455
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:50,546
right now is by telling me
how you feel.

456
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,716
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?

457
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,050
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job,

458
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,358
but you're too afraid
to say it.

459
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,666
Okay, you want to know
the truth?

460
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,421
You already know
what you want to do.

461
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:02,792
And if I try to change your mind
and it goes wrong,

462
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,739
then I'm afraid
you're gonna hold it against me.

463
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:06,762
Would you just say it?

464
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,332
Yes.
I want you to take the job.

465
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:15,838
Look, I know that you love
what you do,

466
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,946
but every day, you go into work
with the possibility

467
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:22,077
of being caught,
and it is eating away at you.

468
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:27,383
If you stay there,
that's just not gonna change.

469
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:34,723
- Jessica. How did--
- It go?

470
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,794
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.

471
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,629
What?
No, it was a good move.

472
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:41,864
Oh, it would have been

473
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,899
if our own bylaws
didn't supersede it.

474
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,568
Th--that's impossible.

475
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:48,037
It was convoluted
and buried in the fine print,

476
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:51,207
and something Louis Litt
never would have missed.

477
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:54,343
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

478
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,812
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.

479
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,181
So when you came
into my office

480
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,283
and told me Louis
had come up with that move,

481
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:05,621
you were full of shit.

482
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:09,258
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.

483
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,006
Well, that kind of thing
only happens once.

484
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:14,730
You know how I know
it's not gonna happen again?

485
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,433
Pack up your shit.

486
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,470
I don't care what kind of deal
you have with Harvey.

487
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,472
You're done.

488
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,413
Why wouldn't you tell her?

489
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:33,782
I said I would cover.

490
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,285
I didn't say I would cover
when it suited me.

491
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,921
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you
to get fired over this.

492
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,757
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.

493
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:42,791
Katrina--

494
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,360
Thank you for your help,
Rachel.

495
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:45,761
I really appreciate it,

496
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,830
but if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

497
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:14,890
He's not here.

498
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,759
Where is he?

499
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:17,960
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.

500
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,695
All he said was he had
a late night.

501
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:22,798
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.

502
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,832
- I was just--
- You're taking the job,

503
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,635
aren't you?

504
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:27,736
I don't know.

505
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,571
Yeah, you do.

506
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:33,575
You just don't want
to admit it.

507
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:36,245
[Sighs]

508
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:39,248
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.

509
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:42,484
[Sighs]

510
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:45,487
God damn it.

511
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:53,262
Do you know what that man
has done for you?

512
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,731
Do you know what it took for him
to start trusting someone?

513
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,900
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.

514
00:23:57,968 --> 00:23:59,435
So someone's dangling some money
in front of you.

515
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,937
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.

516
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,640
I'm gonna say what he won't.

517
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,041
He needs you.

518
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,243
You need this job,
and if you can't see that,

519
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,611
then you might as well
just leave right now.

520
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,915
Donna, someone's offering me
a way out.

521
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:15,250
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do,

522
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,853
but I also care about my life
with Rachel.

523
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:25,427
I don't want to live my life
like this anymore.

524
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:38,374
Then you better be the best
goddamn investment banker

525
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:41,310
this city has ever seen.

526
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:54,690
Scottie, I'm sorry
I was angry in your direction,

527
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,392
but it was really
about something else.

528
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,861
Let me guess, Donna explained
your feelings to you,

529
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:00,329
and now you're here
to apologize.

530
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:02,664
Maybe.

531
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,900
What was the something else?

532
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,469
Mike got a job offer.

533
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,038
And you don't want him
to do it.

534
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:10,039
No, I don't.

535
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,573
Well, if you want him to stay,

536
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,109
you know what's actually
a nice tactic?

537
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:17,079
Telling him
you want him to stay.

538
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,516
What?

539
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,384
Had I known "tell me
what's going on with you"

540
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,053
meant "I'm going to tell you
what to do,"

541
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,521
I might not have
taken you up on it.

542
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,990
Oh, okay. [Laughs]
Mmm.

543
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,833
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

544
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:42,805
You have that paperwork
for me?

545
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:45,174
Well, I got something for you,
but it's not that.

546
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,975
Didn't you learn your lesson
last night?

547
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,210
I learned to listen.

548
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:49,678
When you talked,

549
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,581
you mentioned Hessington Oil,
so I looked back into it.

550
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:54,950
Turns out you don't create
your own luck.

551
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:56,151
Your associate does.

552
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:57,619
What the hell
are you talking about?

553
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,421
He conspired
with Harold Gunderson

554
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,356
to file a lawsuit
against your own client

555
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:03,859
so you could bribe witnesses
not to testify.

556
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,360
- We didn't bribe anyone.
- [Scoffs]

557
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,763
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me

558
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,999
two rookie associates
who went to law school together

559
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,035
and started at the same firm
made this happen

560
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,636
without collusion.
I don't need to tell you

561
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:16,438
anything 'cause
there's nothing to tell.

562
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:18,507
Well, you're gonna
have to tell someone something,

563
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:21,176
because that suit was filed
one day, settled the next,

564
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:23,445
and those witnesses cancelled
their flights to New York.

565
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:24,880
That is a bribe,

566
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,882
and when I bring it
to the attention of the bar,

567
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,486
you and your associate
are going to be in deep shit.

568
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,588
Now who showed his tell?

569
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,890
Here's your money back.

570
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:38,794
And either I go to the bar,
or you settle for $2 million.

571
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:40,796
You have until tomorrow.

572
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:48,606
Where's Mike?

573
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,370
He's in there.

574
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:52,140
Harvey--

575
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,509
- Harvey.
- Not now.

576
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,744
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?

577
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,579
You need to get her
to hack into the bar

578
00:26:58,647 --> 00:26:59,680
and put your name in.

579
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:00,882
What the hell
are you talking about?

580
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,383
A week ago, you told me
that the number one rule

581
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:03,918
was not to move
the goddamn body.

582
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:05,987
A week ago, people weren't
sniffing around you.

583
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:09,023
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.

584
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,658
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

585
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:11,759
with Harold Gunderson.

586
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:13,461
He turned me in?

587
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,830
No, but he will
if we don't cave.

588
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:18,065
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.

589
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,601
He hands you in to the bar,
they look you up, we're done.

590
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,639
Not if I'm not here.

591
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:27,642
Oh, that's why
you're in here.

592
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:30,645
You're taking the job.
I am.

593
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:37,618
And you think
an addicted gambler

594
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:40,688
who lost his wife, his child,
and his house is gonna stop

595
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,657
coming for you just because
you're not working here?

596
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:44,826
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar

597
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:46,360
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

598
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:48,496
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail.

599
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:49,964
You don't do this,
we're gonna get caught.

600
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,399
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.

601
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:52,800
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better

602
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,908
figure something out fast,
because tomorrow morning,

603
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,738
we're done, and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

604
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,349
[Sighs]

605
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,384
You can't fire
Katrina Bennett.

606
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,353
I can fire
whoever I want to.

607
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,922
She was covering for Louis.

608
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,858
What are you talking about?

609
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:19,594
Louis's engagement is over,
and he's losing it.

610
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:21,329
He won't come in to work,
he won't pick up his phone,

611
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,065
and he just didn't want
anyone to know.

612
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:26,634
Then why are you
telling me?

613
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:31,439
Because I helped her
cover for him.

614
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:34,942
Are you saying
I should fire you too?

615
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,315
I am saying that...

616
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,985
We made a mistake,

617
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,187
but that we were just
looking out for Louis,

618
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:50,858
and I know how much
you value loyalty,

619
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:52,393
so I don't think
that should be the thing

620
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:57,298
that costs Katrina her job...

621
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,175
or mine.

622
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,771
- Jessica.
- I need you.

623
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,907
No, listen, I just need
a little more time.

624
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,743
And had you asked me for it,
I would have said yes,

625
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,247
but instead, you had Katrina
cover for you.

626
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:15,716
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?

627
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,952
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you

628
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,888
that she tried to pass off
her work for yours.

629
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:24,091
Louis, Van Dyke wants
to look at our books.

630
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,160
What?
We can't have that.

631
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:29,096
I know.
This was her fix.

632
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,334
Oh, no,
and you used this on him?

633
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:37,371
I did,
and then I fired Katrina.

634
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,507
- Jessica.
- I know.

635
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:41,642
I can't fire her
for being loyal.

636
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,912
But I can't afford you
sitting here licking your wounds

637
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,847
while I get my ass
handed to me.

638
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,282
Please, just listen to me,
okay?

639
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,784
I cannot see straight.

640
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:52,520
I cannot think straight,
and even if I wanted

641
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:56,490
to come and help you, I wouldn't
be any good to you, so...

642
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,528
Louis...

643
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:04,332
I know you loved Sheila,

644
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,202
but do you love your firm?

645
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,203
You know I do.

646
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:10,538
And when you love a woman,

647
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:13,741
can you stand the thought of her
being with another man?

648
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:16,410
- No.
- Well, Louis,

649
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:22,249
Van Dyke is trying to get
into Pearson Specter's pants.

650
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:25,252
What are you going to do
about it?

651
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,924
I'm gonna put on
a goddamn chastity belt.

652
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,225
How?

653
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,461
'Cause Katrina actually
was on the right track.

654
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:36,897
Van Dyke's claim is gone
if the partnership is gone.

655
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,265
The bylaws say it's not.

656
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,869
No, it is
if we become an L.L.C.

657
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:44,872
We can't do that
by tomorrow.

658
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,340
We'd have to rewrite
every contract.

659
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,542
Boy, wow, Jessica, you
sometimes really surprise me.

660
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,711
You don't think I know that?

661
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:52,847
I have an army of associates
that I've trained

662
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,515
within an inch of their lives.

663
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,817
My name is
Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt,

664
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:59,720
and my firm is under siege,
so don't you tell me

665
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:02,790
what I can and cannot do!

666
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:16,297
- Hey.
- Hey.

667
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:19,967
I don't want to interrupt,
but I was just wondering

668
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,168
what happened with Mike.

669
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:23,137
He's leaving.

670
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:25,139
[Sighs]

671
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:30,377
I'm sorry.

672
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:32,980
It's fine.

673
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:36,684
Can I ask you something?

674
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:39,553
Did you tell him
that you wanted him to stay?

675
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:43,557
I didn't get around to it.

676
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,192
You--you didn't
get around to it?

677
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,763
I was gonna tell him, and then
he told me he was leaving,

678
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,664
and then other shit
came up, so...

679
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:52,433
So you just dropped it?

680
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,701
I told you other shit came up.

681
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,970
What other shit?

682
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,072
I mean, you had
an emergency case filing,

683
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,040
so you let your protege
walk out the door?

684
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:02,376
- It's complicated.
- Okay.

685
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:06,380
Well...then share it with me.

686
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:12,419
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.

687
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:14,188
What?
That's bullshit.

688
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:15,256
You may have blurred some lines,

689
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:16,323
but you certainly didn't
cross any.

690
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:17,491
Fight him.

691
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,226
- No, I can't.
- Why?

692
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:21,428
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

693
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,597
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off,

694
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,266
you get in the ring.
What are you saying?

695
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,668
What I'm saying is that
you're not taking on Quelling,

696
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:29,236
but you're letting Mike
walk out the door

697
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:30,504
without trying to stop him.

698
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:31,839
I think one thing changed
the other,

699
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:33,874
and I want to know why.

700
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:36,610
Maybe what changed
is his desire to be here,

701
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:39,780
and maybe what I have to say
doesn't matter.

702
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:42,349
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?

703
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,351
Because it's sure as hell not
about some stupid case.

704
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:45,886
You know what?
God damn it!

705
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:50,057
For once, can't it just be
about what I said it's about?

706
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,793
You didn't say
what it was about.

707
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,775
Harvey, I'm really sorry

708
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:10,311
that the Mike thing turned out
this way.

709
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:13,113
I am, but I can't say
that I didn't see it coming.

710
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:15,749
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What? It isn't what?

711
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:17,017
It isn't what it seems?

712
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:18,452
Because I don't know
what it seems.

713
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,155
All I know is that any time
I ask you about anything,

714
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:24,124
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

715
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,466
I'm just gonna stop asking.

716
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:33,734
Then we'll just
make up later,

717
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:36,904
and we can do it
all over again tomorrow.

718

[Knock at door]

719
00:33:57,692 --> 00:34:01,662
Quelling can't hurt us
anymore.

720
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,798
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.

721
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,734
I wanted to find out
where all that money came from

722
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,002
to find all those clients.

723
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,470
He doesn't have the money.

724
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:10,638
And yet his rent gets paid,

725
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:12,640
and they don't turn off
his electricity.

726
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,514
Holy shit.

727
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:22,216
Guess you didn't have to see
Lola after all.

728
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:25,419
You think I got access to that
with a court order?

729
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:26,720
So you did go see her?

730
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:27,821
You put the idea in my head.

731
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:32,159
I just came up
with a different agenda.

732
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,161
We got him.

733
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:40,234
No.

734
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:42,970
You got him.
What?

735
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:47,007
Your going-away present.

736
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:50,844

You have
my settlement check.

739

I don't have a dime
for you.

740
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:18,305
Then I guess the bar
is going to be hearing from me

741
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:19,640
first thing in the morning.

742
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:23,310
Well, then, they'll also
be hearing from me.

743
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:27,047
Disciplinary rule 5-107a,
"accepting compensation--"

744
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:28,349
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know

745
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,784
the penalty
is being disbarred.

746
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,572
You took money
from our client's competitors

747
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,887
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

748
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:35,556
You didn't come by that
legally.

749

And they're not gonna care.

750
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:38,359
I don't know
if you've noticed,

751
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,094
but I don't have
a hell of a lot to lose,

752
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:42,997
so sign my deal or get
the hell out of my office.

Well, here's the thing,
James.

754

I don't either...

755
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:52,940

as a lawyer anyway.

- Bullshit.
- Look at me.

Good luck
in front of the bar.

758
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:08,455
I wasn't always like this.

759
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,094
I had tobacco in my sights.

760
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:15,596
They offered me a lot
of money.

761
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,731
I could have made a fortune.

762
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:22,369
But $15,000 per client
for people with cancer?

763
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:24,505
I risked going to verdict
because I wanted

764
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:29,109
to get those people something
that could make a difference!

765
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:33,213
And I lost everything...

766
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:35,916
My clients, my wife, my kids!

767
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:38,318
You lost them because
you gambled them away, James.

768
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,320
I know that.

769

where the hell are you?

777
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,241
You said
you could get it done.

778
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:37,711
I walk through those doors,
our books fly open.

779
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:41,615
Get here now.

780
00:37:41,683 --> 00:37:46,220
Well,
this should be fun.

781
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,489
We've never been across
the aisle from each other.

782
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,757
Which is why you don't realize
that it won't be fun.

783
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:52,159
We'll see what we see.

784
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:55,762
Case 41432,
Van Dyke versus Pearson.

785
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,198
Look at that.
Game time.

786
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:01,935
Ladies first.
Ladies first.

787
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:05,105
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?

788
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:08,108
Were you being polite
when you hired me?

789
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,043
What does one have to do
with the other?

790
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:15,449
"To the man who hired me,
for all you've done."

791
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:19,319
Do you want to know what I meant
when I wrote that card?

792
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:21,755
The day you made me that offer,
I asked you,

793
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,558
"did it have anything to do
with gender or race?"

794
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:26,426
You swore it didn't.

795
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,795
You lied to me.

796
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:31,798
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.

797
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:35,235
You know, Daniel Hardman
may have used people,

798
00:38:35,303 --> 00:38:37,104
but he didn't give a shit
about their gender

799
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,505
or their color.

800
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:41,108
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name,

801
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:43,343
an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."

802
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:46,780
Not second in my class.
Diversity.

803
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:48,715
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that,

804
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:50,918
but we both know the truth,

805
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:54,388
which is why I sleep at night
just fine.

806
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,957
Well, it doesn't change
the facts in this case, does it?

807
00:38:57,025 --> 00:39:00,194
No. No, it doesn't,
but this will.

808
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,929
Charles, you remember
Louis Litt?

809
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:03,030
Sorry, I couldn't run.

810
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:04,498
Doctor wanted me
to take it easy.

811
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,699
Hey, Charles.

812
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,701
[Spanks him]
Great to see you.

813
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:13,273
You told me that story
to stall.

814
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,542
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.

815
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,278
But this is for me.

816
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:21,548
When I saw that asterisk
next to my name,

817
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:25,085
it made me sick to my stomach,
because in one second,

818
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:28,021
I understood
how you will always see me.

819
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:29,990
So that card was a thank you,

820
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:31,992
because if I hadn't
have felt sick,

821
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,695
then I might not have worked
as hard as I did

822
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:37,331
to get where I am today.

823
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:39,333
You woke the dragon,
Charles.

824
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,336
How do you like me now?

825
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,616
I know you're there.

826
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:59,486
You need anything?

827
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:01,488
No.

828
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,690
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.

829
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:04,992
We go public Monday morning.

830
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,360
I wasn't talking
about the I.P.O.

831
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:08,161
I was talking about
how you're feeling about Mike.

832
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:11,131
I know.

833
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:16,903
Okay.

834
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,841
Good night, Harvey.

835
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:25,512
I'm gonna tell Scottie.

836
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,149
About Mike?
Are you crazy?

837
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:31,251
You can't have it
both ways, Donna.

838
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,654
You can't tell me to open up
and then keep my secrets.

839
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:36,456
You spent more than a year
covering it up.

840
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,759
You tried to get him to commit
another crime to cover it up,

841
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:40,226
and now--
You said I should tell her

842
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,728
what's really bothering me!

843
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:42,963
I meant your feelings.

844
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,197
I didn't mean
confess to a felony.

845
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:45,866
These are
my goddamn feelings!

846
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:48,368
Donna, I did something
when I hired him.

847
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:49,903
It's caused all of this.

848
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:53,173
I can't tell her,
and it's driving me crazy!

849
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:57,577
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.

850
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,147
I hate that he's gone,
but the jeopardy's gone too.

851
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:02,082
It's done.

852
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,887
And now you want to turn around
and tell someone who--

853
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:09,890
Someone who what?

854
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:14,361
Nothing.

855
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:17,030
No, you better
finish that sentence.

856
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:20,567
Someone who's pissed at you,
Harvey.

857
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:23,403
Someone who keeps finding
a reason to be pissed at you,

858
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,505
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

859
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:27,140
and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying

860
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,409
to help my relationship,
not shit on it.

861
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:31,011
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.

862
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,779
Because I know
you're not mad at me.

863
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:35,115
And I know you're only
telling me this stupid idea

864
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,317
because you want me to tell you
what you already know.

865
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:40,787
You can't, Harvey.

866
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:46,159
It's good that you want to,
but you can't.

867
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:53,567
Could I have a minute?

868
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:07,214
Congratulate me.

869
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:10,784
I'm officially
a member of the New York bar.

870
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:13,186
You went to Lola?

871
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:17,595
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
