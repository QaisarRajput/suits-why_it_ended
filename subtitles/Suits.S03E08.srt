1
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:03,929
I get Ava Hessington acquitted,

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,006
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,675
I don't want it anymore.
Get out of my sight.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,460
You called Mariga
to offer him a bribe.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,645
Doesn't matter--
Dennis never

6
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:12,729
had him in the first place.

7
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:13,763
But he does now.

8
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,982
You're saying
he traced my call.

9
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,985
You're suing me for ownership
of the Mikado?

10
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,137
He said he might as well
have left his cat

11
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,240
with Michael Vick.

12
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,774
I'm offering you
a settlement.

13
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:28,078
You get back the associates,
I get back my cat.

14
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:29,779
Clifford Danner is 18.

15
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:32,582
I put him in jail 12 years ago.
He's innocent.

16
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,816
Cameron buried the evidence.

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,669
Emmanuel Mariga,
20 years ago

18
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:38,121
at the University of Cape Town
on the rugby team.

19
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,090
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

20
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,925
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

21
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:43,677
I'm so sorry, Harvey.

22
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,598
Aah!

23
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,776
Tell me he looks worse.

24
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,896
He does.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,198
Are you hurt?

26
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:07,067
No, I'm fine.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,288
I hope you didn't do that
because of me.

28
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,457
It was a fight, Donna,
not a duel.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,829
- How could I not have--
- Listen to me.

30
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,699
Stephen betrayed us all.

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,334
You don't understand,
Harvey.

32
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,537
I was with him.

33
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,673
And he was capable
of something like that,

34
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,091
and I didn't even see it.

35
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,510
You know, I'm supposed to--
Donna!

36
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,213
It's okay.

37
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,766
Just tell me
you're gonna make him pay.

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,103
He'll pay.

39
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,364
Let's not talk about it.

40
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,417
Talk about what?

41
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,202
What do you need me to do?

42
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,870
I need you to keep going
with everything you have

43
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,405
to impeach
Mariga's testimony.

44
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,590
What about the stuff
on Stephen?

45
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,408
- Not yet.
- Why not?

46
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,793
Because we don't have proof.

47
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:07,928
The trial's in two days.

48
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,129
We should bring Ava in
and tell her--

49
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,130
- Not yet.
- Why not?

50
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,181
Because we don't have proof.

51
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,488
Harvey, we have
to do something.

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,911
And how would
that conversation go?

53
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,019
"Hi, Ava, turns out
one of the lawyers from our firm

54
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,854
"is trying to frame you
for a crime he committed.

55
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,256
But right now we're not sure
we can do anything about it."

56
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,858
What are you gonna do?

57
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,426
I'm gonna go home,
get a good night's sleep,

58
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,644
and then tomorrow
I'm gonna find out

59
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,812
what the whole story is.

60
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,296
Harvey, Stephen
isn't gonna tell you

61
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,615
what the whole story is.

62
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,100
No, but there's
someone else who can.

63
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,104
You knew this case
was heading your way

64
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,489
before you ever
came after us.

65
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,074
That's why
you wanted to merge.

66
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,326
Yes, it is.

67
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,170
And I regret the situation
as much as you do.

68
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,629
But what's done is done.

69
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:44,714
Is that what you told Stephen
when you found out he did it?

70
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:45,882
Found out?

71
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,500
How do we know
he didn't order it?

72
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,285
Because I am giving you
my word.

73
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,471
Why should we trust a man
who sent Stephen over here

74
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:52,973
to cover his ass?

75
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:56,426
I sent Stephen over here
because I care about Ava,

76
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,128
which is why I sent him to
the E.I.R. in the first place.

77
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,481
I had no idea
he would do what he did,

78
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,700
and I have been trying
to fix it ever since.

79
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,069
- Then fix it right now.
- And how exactly can I do that?

80
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:07,704
By stating in court

81
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,106
Stephen acted alone
without Ava's knowledge.

82
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,741
- I can't.
- Why not?

83
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,193
Because he never told me.

84
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,246
And you never asked because
you never wanted to know.

85
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,081
You piece of shit.

86
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:20,000
You care about Ava
so much.

87
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:21,984
How could you
do this to her?

88
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,204
I wasn't doing anything
to her.

89
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,656
I was trying to do
something for her.

90
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,026
Remind me never to ask you
for any favors.

91
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,928
Well, I'm not asking
for a favor.

92
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,347
But you are going to agree
to do something right now.

93
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,217
And what is that?

94
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,028
It's not gonna work.

95
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:51,031
I cut you off
to get your attention.

96
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,951
Well, you have it.

97
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,904
Good, 'cause I just have
one question for you.

98
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,823
How can you live
with yourself?

99
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,658
- What?
- You know what?

100
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,076
I don't have any questions
for you.

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,194
I just came in here to let
you know that you make me sick.

102
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,797
Obviously
I hurt you, Donna,

103
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,883
and I never meant
to do that.

104
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,301
Oh, you didn't hurt me.

105
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,470
You just made me somebody
who slept with a murderer.

106
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:16,256
Murderer?

107
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,258
I don't know
what you think you know,

108
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,394
but those people that
were killed were terrorists.

109
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,645
They were people...

110
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,380
Who lived on top
of something that you wanted.

111
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,233
People who had guns--
murderers, Donna.

112
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,652
Now, if you're so appalled
by how business is done,

113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,154
may I suggest
that you return

114
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,240
all of your designer clothes
that you look so ravishing in,

115
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,076
because they're paid for

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,194
by the dirty work
this firm does.

117
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,579
We don't kill people.

118
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,031
You mean chemical companies
that Harvey represents

119
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,117
or car companies
that Harvey defends?

120
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,921
How about insurance providers
whose claims he helps deny?

121
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:51,073
- Don't bring him into this.
- He's always been in this.

122
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,959
You know what?
I've had enough of this.

123
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,678
I didn't really cut off your
shit to get your attention.

124
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:59,849
I cut it off because
you don't need it anymore.

125
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,267
You're fired.

126
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,521
Darby would never allow that.

127
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:07,140

138
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,815
2 months, 5 days, and 3 hours
under Nigel's tutelage,

139
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,442
and this is what
you have to show for it?

140
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:52,555
That's over 20 motions.

141
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,889
20 dog shits.

142
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,691
Did you get this
out of a Grisham novel?

143
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,009
Because that's fiction.

144
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,728
And you...

145
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:01,030
My mother can get
this motion thrown out.

146
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,015
And you--well, you're gone
anyway in two days.

147
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,150
Listen up, people.

148
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:07,403
I've reviewed your work
in my absence.

149
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,205
And guess what.

150
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:10,689
It's pathetic.

151
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,909
Every stinking one of you
should get down on your knees

152
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,411
and thank God and me

153
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,863
for letting you continue
to exist in our kingdoms.

154
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:23,052
Louis, what was that about?
What's going on?

155
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:24,536
It was about me letting
these assholes know

156
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,538
who's in charge.
They know you're in charge.

157
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,308
They put you in charge.
They didn't put me in shit.

158
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,427
They sat there in judgment while
my character got ripped apart,

159
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,712
and not one of them
lifted a single finger to help.

160
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:36,265
They ruled in your favor.
They chose you over Nigel.

161
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,719
No, they made me
give up Mikado for them.

162
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:44,990
Okay, you're displacing your
anger over Mikado onto them.

163
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:48,277
They didn't put you
in this position.

164
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:49,779
It's not fair.

165
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:50,946
You're right.

166
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,732
They didn't put me
in this position,

167
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:54,867
but I know who did.

168
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,285
Goddamn Darby--

169
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,329
unleashes his dog, leaves us
to clean up the mess.

170
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:59,705
We can still go after Mariga
in court.

171
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,073
I mean,
he's an admitted murderer

172
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,591
who cut a deal
to save his life.

173
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:03,926
Wait a second.

174
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,678
That deal is only good
if he's telling the truth.

175
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,713
We can't go after him
with the truth on the stand.

176
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:10,916
Maybe, but we can go after him
with the truth not on the stand.

177
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,918
Cameron would have
to be willing to listen.

178
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,303
Then I better
get him to listen.

179
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:15,688
And I better
go after Mariga.

180
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:17,756
- And change your clothes.
- What? Why?

181
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:19,892
If they see a lawyer
within 20 yards of that lobby,

182
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:22,427
they'll lock the place down.

183
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:57,730
- Oh, you're not room service.
- No, I'm not, but...

184
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,765
I do need to talk
to Colonel Mariga.

185
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:02,434
And I need to stop paying
alimony to my cheating ex-wife,

186
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,303
but that's not going
to happen.

187
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,855
If you let me in,
maybe I can make that happen.

188
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,574
And how the hell are you
gonna make that happen?

189
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:11,410
I'm a lawyer.

190
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:12,945
You don't look like
a lawyer to me.

191
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,146
Okay. All right.
You got me.

192
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,498
Look, I'm not--
I'm not a lawyer.

193
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,834
In fact, between you and me,
I'm a complete fraud.

194
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,921
But what I am
is Colonel Mariga's cousin.

195
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,592
On his mother's side.

196
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:27,676
- All right.
- Okay, all right!

197
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:28,878
All right,
you don't believe me?

198
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,630
That's fine.
Just do me a favor, okay?

199
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,933
Give him this photo
of him and my Uncle Stephen.

200
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,355
Then let him decide
if he wants to talk to me.

201
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,891
Louis, how did you
get in here?

202
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,192
I told them
I was your uncle.

203
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:44,560
Though how they could believe
that we share

204
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:45,728
the same DNA is beyond me.

205
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,063
This is about your trial,
isn't it?

206
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,188
You're goddamn right
it is!

207
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,282
Why the hell
would you do that to me?

208
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,034
I had no choice.
I was subpoenaed.

209
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:55,187
It was a mock trial.
You could have refused.

210
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,488
What do you want
from me, Louis?

211
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,856
I want to yell at you!

212
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,425
Well, you can't do that
anymore--you fired me.

213
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,960
Is that what this
whole thing was all about?

214
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,162
You're damn right it was.
And you want to know the truth?

215
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,880
When I found out
about your stupid trial,

216
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:06,365
I called Nigel
and volunteered.

217
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,200
How dare you?

218
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:10,302
Me firing you was business.

219
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,221
You bringing up the death
of my cat--

220
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:13,722
that was personal.

221
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,724
You made me take care
of that stupid cat.

222
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,726
I'm allergic.
It could have killed me.

223
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,228
And when that cat did die,

224
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,730
not only did you never tell me
that it wasn't my fault,

225
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:24,549
you then fired me
in front of my very best friend.

226
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,486
If that's not personal,
then I don't know what is.

227
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,822
Now get the hell
out of my office.

228
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,025
I will.

229
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,828
But before I do,

230
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,947
I have some personal news
for you

231
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:41,283
about how your firing
really went down.

232
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,256
Ah, I love this.
We'd just won the championship.

233
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,590
Might I get a copy?

234
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,592
Yeah, I'll get one
framed for you.

235
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,261
You can look at it
in the ten minutes

236
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:53,762
before they
put you to death.

237
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,580
The photograph
proves nothing.

238
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:59,101
Trust me, there's a whole
lot more where that came from.

239
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:02,471
We know all about the ties
between you and Stephen.

240
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,806
Then bring them up.

241
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,858
But I made a deal
to testify against Ava,

242
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,359
and that is what
I'm going to do.

243
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:08,861
No, you made a deal
to put away

244
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,946
the person responsible
for ordering these killings,

245
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:13,148
and I suggest you do that
while you still can.

246
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,450
Young man...

247
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,952
If your intention is to shake
my testimony,

248
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,270
that is not
going to happen.

249
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,788
It doesn't need
to happen,

250
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,658
'cause once we prove
that you're lying about Ava,

251
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,326
Cameron Dennis is going
to cancel your deal,

252
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,712
and you're gonna come to me
begging for help.

253
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,667
Do you think
you're the scariest man

254
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,002
I've ever sat across from?

255
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:35,637
I know
you're not scared of me.

256
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,474
But you are scared
of your own people,

257
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,225
and you should be,

258
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:41,477
because you and I
both know

259
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:44,296
they're gonna kill you
the minute you get back.

260
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:46,965
That I know Stephen doesn't
mean I'm lying about Ava.

261
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:48,100
But you are.

262
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,235
Ah, and you can see
into my soul.

263
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,237
It doesn't take a fortune
teller to know you're lying.

264
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,806
And it doesn't take one
to know that if you had proof,

265
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,742
you wouldn't be here
talking to me.

266
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:01,480
So you're not protecting
Stephen out of principle.

267
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,499
I'm not a man
of principle.

268
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,251
I'm a man of expediency.
I get it.

269
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:08,787
If you change your tune now,
you'll lose the deal you have.

270
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:13,008
Therefore, I prefer to--
how do you say it--

271
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,011
dance with the one
who brought me.

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,518
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

273
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,219
Game time's tomorrow.
We got nothing to say.

274
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:25,670
I'm here to help you.

275
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,356
I don't need your help.

276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,341
And you wouldn't be here
unless you need mine.

277
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,809
You're wrong.

278
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,945
I can help you do what you
always said you're all about--

279
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,446
putting bad guys away.

280
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,315
You got a confession for me?

281
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,233
You're going
after the wrong person.

282
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,202
You're her lawyer.
That's what you would say.

283
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:42,237
I'm not here as her lawyer.

284
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,705
This isn't a speech
for a jury.

285
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,958
I'm here man-to-man to talk
to the guy I used to know.

286
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,077
All right.

287
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,628
Talk.

288
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,748
- I know who really did this.
- Then tell me who it is.

289
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,299
I need a guarantee
you won't use

290
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,700
what I tell you
against Ava.

291
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:57,469
If you think
I'm gonna guarantee you

292
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,421
anything but a war tomorrow,

293
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,039
you are sadly mistaken.

294
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,092
I can't tell you who did it,
but somebody else can.

295
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:04,376
Who?

296
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,878
Colonel Mariga.

297
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,897
Are you kidding me?

298
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:10,549
I've got the murder weapon.

299
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,051
He says Ava Hessington
pulled his trigger,

300
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,886
and you want me to have him
change his story?

301
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:16,054
He's only pointing at Ava

302
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,389
because that's what
you want to hear.

303
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,224
Change his deal,
he'll tell you the truth.

304
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,660
He changes his story now,

305
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,862
anything he says
about anybody means shit.

306
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:25,447
It means shit in court,
but if you are

307
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:28,784
who you say you are,
it should mean something to you.

308
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:30,285
You know what, Harvey?

309
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,005
I believe that you believe
she's innocent,

310
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,433
and if you can convince me
of that,

311
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,458
I won't go after her,
but I'm not gonna guarantee

312
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,594
I won't use what you say
before I hear it.

313
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:41,413
- You want me to just trust you?
- That's what you're asking me.

314
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:44,299
But if you think that I'm gonna
kneecap my star witness

315
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:47,553
the day before the trial,
you are out of your mind.

316
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,680
Harold.

317
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:53,964
What's up, man?
it's good to see you.

318
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,449
I thought
you were my friend.

319
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,017
I am.
What the hell?

320
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:58,919
Friends don't say they tried
to save your job

321
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,421
when, really,
they hung you out to dry.

322
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:02,756
So it's true.

323
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,275
Look, Harold,
I didn't mean to--

324
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,110
You know what? Save whatever
bullshit explanation you have,

325
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,445
because I don't want
to hear it.

326
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,363
I'm not trying to give you
a bullshit explanation.

327
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,531
Because there is none.

328
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,116
You got to choose
between you and me,

329
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,433
and you chose yourself.

330
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,383
And then you lied to me
about it.

331
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:16,434
Yes, Harold, I did.

332
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,679
And then after I lied to you,

333
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,572
I got you a job
at a huge, powerful firm.

334
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,157
Yeah, you got me that job
so I'd owe you one

335
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,158
when the time came.

336
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:24,392
I got you that job

337
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:26,060
because I thought you deserved
a second chance.

338
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:28,580
And then you came calling
when you needed a lawsuit filed

339
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,565
to get rid of your witnesses
in your murder trial.

340
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,033
I trusted you
with that lawsuit

341
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:33,451
because I thought
you were a competent attorney.

342
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,787
And you were more than happy
to take it.

343
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,456
And that murder trial you just
mentioned is about to start.

344
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,792
So you can choose to be
pissed off with me or move on.

345
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,511
But right now
I have a job to do.

346
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,102
- Rachel.
- Louis, what did you do?

347
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,604
What do you mean?
What is this?

348
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:54,806
Fairfield Computers
is being sued.

349
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,691
- How's that my fault?
- Because they're your client,

350
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,360
and the attorney of record
is Harold Gunderson.

351
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:01,029
He also sent
a settlement offer.

352
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,782
He wants to pick
a fight with me.

353
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,266
He's gonna regret
the day he was born.

354
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,818
Aren't you the one
who picked a fight with him?

355
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:08,787
Rachel, whose side
are you on?

356
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:10,121
Don't answer that question.

357
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,293
You shouldn't be here.

358
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:18,797
Stephen said that we're
no different than he is.

359
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,832
I need to see you show him
that he's wrong.

360
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,051
This isn't his trial.
It's Ava's.

361
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,619
You're not gonna put him
on the stand?

362
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,471
You said you were gonna
make him pay.

363
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:29,057
Donna, I will,
but now is not the time.

364
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:31,292
Then when?
Because he killed people,

365
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:34,062
and if we let him
get away with it...

366
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,348
Then maybe we are
no different than he is.

367
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,402
Had these insurgents
had their way,

368
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,153
they would have blown up
the pipeline.

369
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:45,073
Instead, Ms. Hessington
retained a valuable asset,

370
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,159
and I, in turn, was compensated
for a job well done.

371
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:52,030
And this compensation came
directly from Ava Hessington?

372
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:53,498
Yes.

373
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,784
She specifically directed you
to kill people?

374
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:58,203
Yes.

375
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,154
One more thing,
Colonel Mariga--

376
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,340
do you and I have a deal
for you to testify

377
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:05,010
in exchange
for a more lenient sentence?

378
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:06,994
Yes.

379
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,329
And why should
the jury believe

380
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:10,665
that you aren't making this up
to save yourself?

381
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,101
Because if what I say to you
proves to be a lie,

382
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,336
you'll send me back home,

383
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:18,023
where I will be dead
within minutes.

384
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,357
No further questions.

385
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,146
Ten minutes recess.

386
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,198
Why didn't you just
jump right in there?

387
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,200
I get it--
you read a book that says

388
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,518
you don't let the jury
sit with things.

389
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:31,619
The only problem is...

390
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,787
We're not inside
of a book.

391
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:34,322
And I don't want
to seem defensive.

392
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,413
Harvey, we still have
a ton of shit to hit him with.

393
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,693
Were you in there?
They're buying what he's saying.

394
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:40,184
Then we make them
buy something else.

395
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,796
We got a pair of aces.

396
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,248
If the jury believes that
Cameron's got three of a kind,

397
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,533
we're not gonna win.
We can't go after Stephen.

398
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,918
Cameron
won't go after Ava

399
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,553
if I can convince him
it was Stephen.

400
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:49,971
- You went to Cameron?
- Yes.

401
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:51,539
And you're going
to trust him?

402
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,041
I'm not sure
we have another choice.

403
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:58,430
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

404
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:00,014
don't.

405
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,933
I'm thinking I'd like
to rip your face off.

406
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:03,618
You get Mariga
to point the finger at me,

407
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:05,720
I will point it
straight at Ava.

408
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,490
Stephen, Jessica
doesn't respond well to threats.

409
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:09,991
Well, I don't make threats.

410
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,110
I give warnings.

411
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,195
You've been warned.

412
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,454
Mr. Specter...

413
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:25,173
I have no questions
for Colonel Mariga, Your Honor,

414
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,241
but I'd like to call
a rebuttal witness.

415
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,094
Harvey, come on,
you know what he's gonna say.

416
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,795
I don't care
what he's gonna say.

417
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,797
He's talking to the jury.
I'm talking to Cameron Dennis.

418
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:36,968
The defense calls
Stephen Huntley to the stand.

419
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:39,788
What has Stephen Huntley
got to do with this?

420
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,439
Harvey knows
what he's doing.

421
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:42,807
This is what
you wanted to sell me--

422
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,109
a lawyer from your own
goddamn firm?

423
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,473
You want to put away
the bad guy?

424
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:47,946
I'm about to hand him to you
on a silver platter.

425
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,282
Mr. Huntley,
did you work at the law firm

426
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,535
headed by Edward Darby
last year?

427
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,203
Yes.

428
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,872
Did Mr. Darby ask you
to solve any problems

429
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,374
for Hessington Oil

430
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,576
regarding their pipeline
in the E.I.R.?

431
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:03,711
I decline to answer under
my fifth amendment rights.

432
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,964
The right
against self-incrimination.

433
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:07,415
How long have you known
Colonel Mariga?

434
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,633
I decline to answer.

435
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,502
Is it true that you
went to school with him

436
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:11,836
at the University
of Cape Town?

437
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:12,954
I decline to answer.

438
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:14,422
Well, let me refresh
your memory.

439
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,391
You were teammates
on a championship rugby team.

440
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,476
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

441
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,011
The witness is hostile,
Your Honor.

442
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,930
Hostile? They work
at the same law firm.

443
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,431
He was fired yesterday.

444
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,099
Gentlemen, approach.

445
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,321
He's making things up
to create reasonable doubt.

446
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,824
I'm bringing things up,
so you'll see the truth.

447
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,577
The only thing tying Ava to this
is Mariga's testimony.

448
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:38,496
You only have Mariga because
you tapped Stephen's phone.

449
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,814
That's a ridiculous
accusation.

450
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:40,999
Cameron, please.

451
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,835
Why did he call him?
How did he call him?

452
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,336
Enough.

453
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,455
You're on a short leash,
Mr. Specter.

454
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,991
The gentleman
invoked his rights.

455
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,848
Mr. Huntley, did you meet
with your old friend

456
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,500
Emmanuel Mariga
and direct him

457
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:02,604
to kill the opponent
of Hessington Oil's pipeline

458
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,139
without Ava Hessington's
knowledge?

459
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:08,109
I decline to answer.

460
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:09,777
I have
no further questions.

461
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:12,530
Mr. Dennis,
do you have any questions?

462
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:16,851
Mr. Dennis.

463
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,292
Mr. Huntley,
until you were let go,

464
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,528
you worked at the same firm
as Mr. Specter, correct?

465
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,196
Yes.

466
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,050
And his job today
is to give this jury

467
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:36,087
cause to doubt that
his client is the murderer?

468
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:38,039
- Yes.
- In your experience...

469
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,592
Is pointing the finger
at someone else

470
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,209
a good strategy?

471
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,479
It can be
an excellent strategy.

472
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:46,981
And why do you think
that Mr. Specter

473
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,766
is pointing the finger
at you?

474
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,735
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

475
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,888
that a few weeks ago
Ms. Hessington approached me

476
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,273
and asked me
to bribe witnesses

477
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,025
who were about
to testify against her,

478
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,443
and I refused.

479
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,111
And if you think
I'm lying under oath,

480
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:03,114
then, please,
ask Mr. Specter.

481
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,499
He knows that's the truth.

482
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,452
And a woman who bribes
witnesses against her

483
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:08,670
is not innocent.

484
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:09,787
Objection.

485
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,739
Withdrawn.
One last thing.

486
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,842
Did the defendant
ask you to arrange a meeting

487
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,211
with Colonel Mariga
where she she would pay him

488
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:20,632
millions of dollars
in exchange for...

489
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,634
Killing opponents
of her pipeline?

490
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,936
I decline to answer.

491
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,939
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

492
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:29,641
No further questions.

493
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:41,707
Is Stephen Huntley involved
in this,

494
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:44,890
or is it some kind of stunt like
he just told the jury it was?

495
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,391
He ordered the killings.

496
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,510
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't have proof.

497
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:58,845
Why would you put
that man on the stand?

498
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,631
It was a calculated risk.

499
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,350
You took a calculated risk
with my life

500
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,586
without telling me.

501
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,531
I'm sorry.

502
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,409
You screwed me.

503
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:21,911
I said
I wouldn't go after her

504
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,879
if you convinced me--
you didn't convince me.

505
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,081
Then take a recess

506
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,882
instead of twisting
everything he said.

507
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,768
I'm not gonna let the jury
sit with that shit.

508
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,219
And thank God I didn't.

509
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:31,870
Otherwise,
I would have found out

510
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:33,556
that she tried
to bribe witnesses

511
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,890
and you kept it from me.

512
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,676
It had nothing to do
with the murders.

513
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:38,227
That's funny--
when I kept things from you

514
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,679
that had nothing to do
with other murders,

515
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,730
you called me a criminal.

516
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:41,897
Well, that ended up
with you

517
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:43,816
putting an innocent person
in prison.

518
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:45,935
And now you're doing it again.
Oh, don't give me that shit.

519
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,237
Stephen Huntley is up
to his goddamn neck in this,

520
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:49,772
and you know it.

521
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:52,742
So he just goes around
killing his clients' enemies

522
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:53,892
behind their backs?

523
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:55,161
I don't think so.

524
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:56,996
You want corroboration?
Ask Mariga.

525
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,063
I just did.

526
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:00,416
And he answered me
in open court.

527
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,251
And I'm not putting
an innocent woman away.

528
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:04,120
I'm doing my job.
Cameron-

529
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:06,122
Lawyers killing people?

530
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,924
That's a hell of a firm
you got your name on, Harvey.

531
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:12,628
You must be proud to have left
the D.A.'s office for that.

532
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,584
Let's do racquetball,
James.

533
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,219
Again? Louis, you were
supposed to be waiting

534
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,687
in the conference--
I don't wait for anyone.

535
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:22,938
And you don't sue me.

536
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:24,774
Yes, I do.

537
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,393
Because I realized
I now work at a huge firm,

538
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,261
and I have the power
to do this to you.

539
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:30,674
Now, we can negotiate
a settlement,

540
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,815
unless, of course, you don't
think you can handle me.

541
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,650
Do you really want
to embarrass yourself

542
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,101
with your mother watching?

543
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,903
It kills you that they
don't ban us having pictures

544
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:40,105
of our mothers,
like you did, doesn't it?

545
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,241
A man is judged
by the photos he displays.

546
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,826
You have a photo
of yourself.

547
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,295
And now you're making
my point for me.

548
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,298
You don't intimidate me
anymore, Louis.

549
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:52,301
Really?
I know you, Harold.

550
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:54,470
I know that you gargle
before meetings

551
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,505
that make you nervous.

552
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,459
And I...smell...mint.

553
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,561
- I--
- We don't agree

554
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,647
to paragraph three or four.
I need to have four.

555
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,898
Or seven through ten.

556
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:08,967
My mo--my client
won't stand for that.

557
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:12,655
Your client will stand for
whatever the hell I give them!

558
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,357
Please, can I have nine?

559
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,280
You know what?

560
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,698
I'll give you nine...

561
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:24,303
Because it's meaningless,
and I want it

562
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,318
to tell all the other paragraphs
out there what happens

563
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,921
when Harold Gunderson
goes after Louis Litt.

564
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,489
That doesn't make any sense.

565
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,874
Haven't you ever seen
a mob movie?

566
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,209
They always let one survive
to tell the others.

567
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,010
Well, yeah,
but paragraphs can't talk--

568
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:37,213
Okay, whatever. Fine.
Just type this up as agreed,

569
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,765
and don't you ever let me see
your pasty, Norwegian,

570
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,551
Carrot Top-wannabe
face again.

571
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,555
Carrot Top is a very
underrated comedian

572
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,173
who's never done anything
to anyone.

573
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,695
Did you know that Harvey
was going to ambush Stephen

574
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:53,896
on the stand?

575
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,514
I wouldn't have stopped him
if I did.

576
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,483
And to hell
with the ramifications?

577
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,869
The ramifications for who,
Edward?

578
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:02,037
I didn't come here to fight
with you, Jessica.

579
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,189
But Stephen didn't take
the most direct hit.

580
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,524
Ava did.

581
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,710
You keep talking about
how much you care about Ava.

582
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:09,211
But I've only just met her.

583
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:12,882
And you're the one who did
what you did.

584
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:18,921
I treated you
as if you were my own blood.

585
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,005
Ava...

586
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:21,807
Did you do this to me?

587
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,342
Of course I didn't.

588
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:27,146
Did you keep this
from me?

589
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:30,566
I want to hear you say it.

590
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,051
I didn't know
until it was too late.

591
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:38,240
I didn't want to burden you
with what had been done

592
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:39,909
to get your pipeline,

593
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:42,278
and there was nothing
I could do to undo it.

594
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:43,913
Burden me?

595
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:45,397
What about protecting me?

596
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:46,949
Well, that's exactly
what I was doing

597
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,734
when I assigned Harvey
to the case.

598
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,920
And after I was brought up
on murder charges,

599
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,171
rather than tell me,

600
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:54,406
you send the very man
who committed the crime.

601
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,092
Who were you trying
not to burden then?

602
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:12,274
You once asked me if she knew
about her father and I.

603
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,929
In those days,
to be a lawyer and to be out--

604
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,148
not possible.

605
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:20,983
Her father
was in the oil business.

606
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,268
He would have been finished.
What does that have to do-

607
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,438
We used to go away
on occasion.

608
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,324
In order to do that,

609
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:32,294
Ava joined us and pretended
to be my girlfriend.

610
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,829
She did that for us.

611
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:40,970
Ava is family to me.

612
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,922
I sent Stephen out there
to help her.

613
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:44,890
I didn't know what he'd do.

614
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,309
And I would give anything
to undo it.

615
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:53,148
What do you want
from me, Edward?

616
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,900
I want you to put aside
your anger

617
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:56,735
and figure out a way to help.

618
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,110
What are you doing here?

619
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,663
I'm here to put aside
my anger.

620
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:09,999
We're in the middle
of a murder trial.

621
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,418
We can spare
five minutes for this.

622
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:14,003
Wait a second.

623
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,006
I gave you that bottle
when you took over from Daniel.

624
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,825
- I know.
- I told you to only open it

625
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,010
in case of an emergency.

626
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,996
You think this isn't
an emergency?

627
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,931
We're about
to lose a huge murder case,

628
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,017
and it turns out
the person behind it

629
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,019
is one of our own lawyers.

630
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:32,021
And we're in business

631
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:34,056
with the man
who helped cover it up.

632
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,008
But the thing
that's been most on my mind

633
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,945
is that you goddamn
betrayed me.

634
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:44,483
Now...

635
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:48,203
The truth is, you warned me
about all of this.

636
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,957
And I am tired
of feeling betrayed by you.

637
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,376
I'd rather forgive you.

638
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:57,630
Can you?

639
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,748
Why do you think I'm here?

640
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,551
I never should have come
after you.

641
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,887
I'm sorry.

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,424
You didn't kill anybody.

643
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:11,310
And if I'm really
going to forgive you,

644
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:13,262
then I need
to tell you I'm sorry

645
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:15,898
that I made you want to do it
in the first place.

646
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,074
What changed your mind?

647
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:28,226
Edward.

648
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:31,413
He said Ava
was family to him.

649
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,917
You're family to me,

650
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,169
and you did what he didn't.

651
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:39,038
You came clean.

652
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:42,124
Is that all you came here
to tell me?

653
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,677
Like you said, we're in
the middle of a murder trial.

654
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:47,096
And you have an idea.

655
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,714
We're not the only people

656
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,799
that are like family
to each other.

657
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:52,718
And sometimes
you have to put your family

658
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:54,803
in a position
where they don't have a choice.

659
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:57,089
What do you need me to do?

660
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:07,051
New plan-we're gonna
convince Cameron

661
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:08,192
that Ava's innocent.

662
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,942
Have you been drinking?

663
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,410
Yeah. Why?

664
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:12,912
Because wasn't that
the old plan?

665
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,163
That was the old goal.

666
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,981
This time, it's you
who's going to Cameron.

667
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:17,533
If he won't hear
the truth from you,

668
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:19,702
how's he gonna hear it
from me?

669
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,872
Cameron can't see the truth
because all he sees

670
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:24,373
is that he has
a winnable case.

671
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,175
How does that affect
what I just said?

672
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,676
Prosecutors are hammers,

673
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,082
and they see the accused
as nails.

674
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:31,263
How am I gonna change that?

675
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:32,515
You're gonna gonna remind him

676
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,050
about the time
he hit the wrong nail.

677
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:39,021
Can you tell me
how the waffles are here?

678
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:42,641
Mike Ross, my man.

679
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:43,842
It's good to see you, man.

680
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,694
It's good to see you too,
Clifford.

681
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,530
What the hell you doing out
in the middle of the night?

682
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:48,731
Oh, you know, I told you.

683
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,033
I got an urge
for some waffles.

684
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:52,851
This isn't a coincidence,
is it?

685
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,954
I need a favor.

686
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,455
No doubt.
What you need?

687
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:59,041
I need you to talk
to Cameron Dennis.

688
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,210
No.

689
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,461
Hell, no.

690
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,330
- Clifford...
- Look at me, man.

691
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,048
Look where I am...

692
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,250
Cleaning up people's shit!
I know.

693
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:10,386
You know this is all I can get
because of him?

694
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,306
My life passed me by
because of that motherf--

695
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,809
I get in a room with him,
I'll kill him.

696
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,356
And I need you to tell him
all of that

697
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:20,646
so that he doesn't do
the same thing to somebody else.

698
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:23,065
You need?

699
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,401
I know who "you" is.

700
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:27,436
And I don't owe Harvey shit.

701
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,054
Now, he may have
got me out,

702
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,390
but he and Cameron put me there
in the first place.

703
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,160
Yeah, you're right.
You don't owe Harvey.

704
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,412
But you do owe me...

705
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:38,747
'Cause I didn't have anything
to do with putting you in there,

706
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:41,450
but I broke the law
to get you out.

707
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:49,908
I am feeling generous,

708
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,911
so absolutely, 100%,
without a doubt,

709
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,680
go screw yourself.

710
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:56,098
Everything okay?

711
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:57,416
Yeah, of course.

712
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:58,851
I was just using
tactic number 36

713
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,586
in Louis Litt's handbook,
due to be published never

714
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,221
because I don't share
my tactics.

715
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,607
Tactic number seven,
by the way.

716
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,091
Okay.

717
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:08,594
Well, whatever tactic you used
on Harold didn't work.

718
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:10,029
He's not caving.

719
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,530
I don't know
what you're talking about,

720
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:12,982
because he gave me
everything I wanted.

721
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,400
The client just called.

722
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,768
The contract Harold sent over
has a loophole in it.

723
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,405
It leaves him open
to punitive damages.

724
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,940
Paragraph nine.

725
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,542
Get that contract back.

726
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,911
We need to renegotiate.

727
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,964
Oh, my God, Harold
pulled one over on you.

728
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,329
Don't you dare
say that out loud.

729
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:31,617
Call him up,
set up the appointment

730
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,335
for me to go over there.
I tried.

731
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,671
He insisted on coming here.
He's on his way right now.

732
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:36,972
He?

733
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:42,811
What the hell
are you doing here?

734
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,796
He's here
to tell you who you are.

735
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:46,015
I know who I am.

736
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,150
I don't need
to hear it from him.

737
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:50,986
You think I'm giving you
a choice?

738
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:07,119
Okay. We were supposed to meet
in the conference room.

739
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,850
I don't need to wait
in the conference room

740
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,489
to knock your dick
in the dirt.

741
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,840
What'd you just say to me?

742
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,492
<i>It's from The Breakfast Club,
asshole.</i>

743
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,344
<i>Not all of us only watch
The Sound Of Music.</i>

744
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:17,880
You little bastard.
You just crossed a line.

745
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:20,165
Julie Andrews
is a national treasure.

746
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,551
Maybe your client
would be better off with her.

747
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:23,636
Maybe they would be.

748
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,837
But she isn't here.
And I am.

749
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,006
And here are a few
of my favorite things--

750
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,892
countersuit for slander,

751
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:31,894
motion to decertify class,

752
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,696
motion for summary judgment,

753
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,981
change of venue, sanctions,

754
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,201
depositions, discovery!

755
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,620
Great use
of folders there, Louis.

756
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:43,405
Too bad none of them
are gonna work.

757
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,023
Well, they may not work
on the case,

758
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:47,209
but they're definitely
gonna work on you.

759
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:48,794
What are you talking about?

760
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,862
Oh, I'm talking
about you may win in the end,

761
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:53,749
but it won't justify you
spending every waking minute

762
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,250
of your life
on this bullshit,

763
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:58,253
instead of doing everything else
you've been assigned to do.

764
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:00,639
- You'd do that to me?
- I won't be doing it to you.

765
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,641
I'll be doing it
for Bratton Gould.

766
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,143
And you'll be laughed
out of there

767
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,850
the same way you were laughed
out of here.

768
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,479
- Louis--
- We got nothing left to say!

769
00:31:07,547 --> 00:31:09,231
Drop the suit
by the end of the week,

770
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:11,600
or one of my associates
will see you in court.

771
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,735
Get out!

772
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:28,250
I don't want him here.

773
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:31,587
Ava, whatever he did,
he's here to help,

774
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,772
and he's an asset.

775
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,908
Then what does the mighty
Edward Darby have to say?

776
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,961
You're innocent
until proven guilty

777
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:40,546
beyond a reasonable doubt.

778
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:41,764
Take the stand.

779
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:44,216
Any juror that hears you
will have that doubt.

780
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,801
She opens that door,
the first question

781
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:48,887
Cameron asks is, did she try
and bribe those witnesses?

782
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:53,809
The answer is yes.
There goes reasonable doubt.

783
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:55,194
How much did you pay him?

784
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,945
- Cameron.
- Pay who?

785
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,615
Don't play dumb.
Clifford Danner.

786
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,483
Who the hell
is Clifford Danner?

787
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:03,952
He was an innocent person
that Cameron put behind bars.

788
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:05,717
And I thought
he would make you see reason.

789
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:06,955
That has nothing
to do with this.

790
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,607
And I didn't put him
behind bars--you did.

791
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:10,042
Then I got him out.

792
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,960
Well, you're not getting
her out, because she did it,

793
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:14,713
and yesterday your own colleague
said that she did it.

794
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:17,166
He did not say that,
and you know it.

795
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,251
- You willing to take that risk?
- What are you suggesting?

796
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,753
I've worked with him
long enough

797
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:22,137
to know what he's suggesting.

798
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:24,056
Cameron Dennis
doesn't go to verdict.

799
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:25,758
He cuts deals.
Then let me tell you...

800
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,310
About what's
behind door number one--

801
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,961
Eight years.

802
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:34,400
Eight years instead of forever.
Leave us alone.

803
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,069
Court's in ten minutes.
You have until then.

804
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,072
Harvey...

805
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:41,857
He's got us,
and you know it.

806
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,108
No, he doesn't.

807
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:45,027
She's not going to prison
for one day.

808
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:46,912
She's going
for the rest of her life

809
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:48,647
if we don't take this deal.

810
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:50,332
I am not losing to him.

811
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,151
You-your blood feud

812
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,204
or whatever it is
you have with that man

813
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,207
is what put the target
on my back in the first place.

814
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,843
Ava, we need
to face reality.

815
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:03,262
She is not taking that deal.

816
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:06,348
She better, because
she can't buy her way out of it.

817
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,834
And you can't cover up
your way out of it.

818
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,335
- I don't care.
- Well, what's your idea?

819
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,770
Because unless
you're gonna testify

820
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,939
that Stephen did this
without Ava's knowledge,

821
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:15,140
you can't help.

822
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:16,892
And as you said,
you have no proof.

823
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:20,479
So why don't you get out of the
room and let the grown-ups talk?

824
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,398
What if I was
to testify to that?

825
00:33:25,318 --> 00:33:26,902
What are you talking about?

826
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:29,571
I'm talking about putting
words to a conversation

827
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,874
that should have happened
but didn't.

828
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:35,377
You'd say that you confronted
Stephen, and he admitted it?

829
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:38,363
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

830
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:39,865
This isn't gonna help.

831
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,534
You're her old friend coming
to her aid at the last second.

832
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,669
It's a lie.

833
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,087
The jury will see
right through it.

834
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:46,755
Then we need to make Cameron
believe it.

835
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,757
Harvey, Cameron wants a win.

836
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:50,759
You need to convince him
this is a win.

837
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:53,479
Can you do that?

838
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:56,899
I guess it's the best shot
we have.

839
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,909
I knew you would cave.
With five minutes to spare.

840
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,450
We're not here
to take your offer, Cameron.

841
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,752
We want you to take ours.

842
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:16,070
Nah, I'm not negotiating.
Eight years is final.

843
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,739
This isn't about making
a deal for Ava.

844
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,174
It's about making
a deal for me.

845
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:22,076
If he's got something
to say about this,

846
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,179
you should put him
on the stand.

847
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:27,966
I already trusted you once.
I need your word.

848
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,918
Go ahead.
Off the record.

849
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,388
I instructed Stephen Huntley
to do whatever it took

850
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,806
to get Ava her pipeline,

851
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:37,642
and I told him
to do it behind her back.

852
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:39,594
So you authorized
these murders.

853
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:40,762
Absolutely not.

854
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:42,430
When I heard people
had been killed,

855
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:43,648
I confronted him immediately.

856
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,283
And what did he say?

857
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:47,285
He didn't care
that he'd resorted to murder.

858
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,103
His job
was to get things done.

859
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:53,158
You just admitted to being
an accessory after the fact.

860
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:54,826
No, he didn't.

861
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:58,914
I get it.
Off the record.

862
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:00,114
What do you want?

863
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,500
Edward pleads
to obstruction of justice--

864
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:03,885
five years probation.

865
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:06,004
You drop the charges
against Ava.

866
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,138
And he testifies

867
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,891
at Stephen Huntley's
murder trial.

868
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:15,129
And why would I swap out Ava
for her minion?

869
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:18,984
Cameron, you gave us
that offer for a reason.

870
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,469
You're at the finish line--
you can taste the win,

871
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,239
but it's not 100%,
and you know it,

872
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,346
because you're still banking
on an admitted murderer

873
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:27,859
with an incentive to lie.

874
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:29,694
I'm giving you
a respected lawyer

875
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,814
with an incentive to keep
his mouth shut.

876
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:35,316
You know who has
a better chance

877
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:38,870
at getting you a win.

878
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:45,043
Draw up the paperwork.

879
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:09,367
I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

880
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:11,185
I thought
about what you said.

881
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:14,022
What, about the kind
of business your firm does?

882
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:16,741
Yes.

883
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,793
And I realized that maybe
you're not as bad

884
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,879
as I said you were.

885
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:23,698
- No?
- No.

886
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:28,386
You're much worse.

887
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:35,376
Harvey and Cameron
made a deal to take you down,

888
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,896
and part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

889
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,065
to tell you about it.

890
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:47,555
I meant it when I said
I never meant to hurt you.

891
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:50,859
And I meant it when I said
that you make me sick.

892
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,286
It's all there.

893
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,122
You testify, you get
five years probation.

894
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:06,591
And he pleads
obstruction of justice.

895
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:08,426
- What is this?
- What is what?

896
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:10,428
This says that I forfeit
my license

897
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:12,430
to practice law
in this country.

898
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,582
Oh, that--that's just
something I added in.

899
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,718
- This is unacceptable.
- Wait a minute.

900
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,920
How could you add that in
if we did the paperwork?

901
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,106
And if he can't practice law
in the country,

902
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,470
he can't be a member
of our firm.

903
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:25,977
We must have agreed to it
in advance.

904
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:28,480
You set
this whole thing up.

905
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,448
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

906
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,117
But what's it matter?

907
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:33,785
You really gonna put this
on Ava

908
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:35,537
when you can get off
with a slap on the wrist?

909
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,572
I asked you to put aside
your anger.

910
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:40,742
I did.
You said Ava was family.

911
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:43,628
The thing about family
is they make it easy

912
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:46,915
to put you in the position
where you don't have a choice.

913
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:48,917
Now, you gonna
sign the deal,

914
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:52,120
or do I just pick up the trial
right where we left off?

915
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,476
You're doing
the right thing, Edward.

916
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:01,146
We'll worry about the terms
of our dissolution tomorrow.

917
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:04,799
And, Edward...

918
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,651
We may be getting a divorce,

919
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:09,354
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

920
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:17,812
Who'd have thought
we'd end up here?

921
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,147
I did.

922
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:20,865
No, you didn't.

923
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,700
You took a chance
with Clifford Danner,

924
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,202
and you know it.

925
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,870
It wasn't a chance.

926
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,321
I played the man.

927
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:30,675
And, Cameron, you're not
only about winning.

928
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,178
You're about putting
guilty people away.

929
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:38,049
Nice working with you.

930
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:41,519
Onetime deal.

931
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,044
I guess this means
you're not looking

932
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:44,272
for another name partner?

933
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,141
Goodbye, Cameron.

934
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:55,200
Norma said you
had something for me?

935
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,235
I do.

936
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:01,539
He dropped it.
I win.

937
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:04,409
Do you?

938
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:08,713
What?
What are you talking about?

939
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:11,866
Why do you hate Harold
so much?

940
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,701
- I don't hate him.
- Yeah, you do...

941
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,253
Because I've never seen you
be as mean to anyone

942
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,554
as you are to him.
Rachel, I-

943
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,807
- don't "Rachel" me.
He's a human being.

944
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,558
What's the matter with you?

945
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,767
When I was a kid
in gym class...

946
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:34,105
We had to climb the rope.

947
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:38,059
Every day I tried
really hard,

948
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,278
and every day...

949
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:42,664
Everyone would laugh at me.

950
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:50,905
The one thing in my life
that I've always been great at

951
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,591
is training
the associates...

952
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:56,544
Except for Harold.

953
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,079
He's my failure.

954
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,466
And every time
I look at him, it...

955
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,721
puts me right back
in gym class.

956
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,529
Louis...

957
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:16,865
Harold's climbing
that rope.

958
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,599
He's succeeding.

959
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,535
And the way
you got this victory

960
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,987
was by going
after his career.

961
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:26,658
And you're just yanking him
right back down.

962
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,556
We never got this.

963
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:44,292
Send back his original offer
marked "accepted."

964
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:56,137
I never want this
spoken of again.

965
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,306
You never want what
spoken of again?

966
00:41:01,277 --> 00:41:03,778
Harvey,
what did Ava have to say?

967
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,114
She'd already left
for the airport.

968
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:09,200
Someone saves my life,
I might stop to say thank you.

969
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:10,618
You really blame her

970
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,203
after what this firm
put her through?

971
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:13,588
When you put it
that way...

972
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:15,540
It doesn't matter.
It was a huge win.

973
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:17,158
Go celebrate.

974
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,343
Whoa.
Hey, hey.

975
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:19,827
Don't you mean
"let's go celebrate"?

976
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:21,996
Am I really the person
you want to celebrate

977
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,881
this big murder-trial
victory with?

978
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:25,833
I don't know. It depends.
Do you put out?

979
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:28,336
- Why don't you ask Rachel?
- That's not funny.

980
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:46,537
Harvey.

981
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:49,324
Donna.

982
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,524
How'd it go?

983
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,077
As well as it could.

984
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,699
Harvey...

985
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,037
Thank you.

986
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,556
Why don't you keep the car?

987
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:08,042
I feel like walking tonight.

988
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:16,451
