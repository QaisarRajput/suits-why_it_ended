in front of the entire class
to win an argument.

So the professor offered me
an Innocence Project case,

but if I do...

- Aw, come on.

1086
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,552
He takes one sip of this,
we'll have to hear that story

1087
00:40:14,576 --> 00:40:16,042
about the first time
he got laid.

1088
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:19,012
We'd be lucky if
that's the story we get to hear.

1089
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,880
Wow, you guys are drinking?

1090
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,715
You haven't even
heard my news yet.

1091
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,662
You figured out a way
to get Gallo transferred?

1092
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:26,219
Even better.

1093
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,421
I figured out a way
to get Mike out early.

1094
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:29,823
You're kidding me.

1095
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:31,335
You think I came all the way
down here to bullshit you?

1096
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,804
Well, we all know there's
no such thing as a free lunch,

1097
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:35,829
Sean, so what's the catch?

1098
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:38,264
He has to inform on
one of his fellow inmates.

1099
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,411
What makes you think he can
even get close to this guy?

1100
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,468
Oh, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

1101
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:43,770
It's his roommate.

1102
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:47,473
Listen to me, Mike's never
gonna go for this.

1103
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:50,376
So why don't you tell me what
the hell you're talking about?

1104
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,846
Kevin Miller's a smoking gun
on another case.

1105
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:55,092
We tried to get him to turn
on his family but he wouldn't.

1106
00:40:55,116 --> 00:40:56,716
Mike gets him to turn
or figures out

1107
00:40:56,751 --> 00:41:01,554
how to get what we need
out of him anyway, he's free.

1108
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,423
When do you need an answer by?

1109
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,490
Yesterday.

1110
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,759
And the answer needs to be yes.

1111
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,762
