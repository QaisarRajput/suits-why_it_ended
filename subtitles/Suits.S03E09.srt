2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:04,868
I'm bonding
with your father here.

3
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:06,561
- Speaking of which--
- You're not taking it easy

4
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:07,692
on me, are you?
A little.

5
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:09,251
You mean something to me.

6
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,170
You've always meant something
to me

7
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:14,040
and you always will mean
something to me.

8
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,342
What do you need, Harvey?

9
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,960
Ava Hessington.

10
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,845
I am not losing to him.

11
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,097
You.

12
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:23,966
Your blood feud
or whatever it is

13
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,967
you have with that man
is what put the target

14
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,446
on my back in the first place.

15
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:30,195
I made this mess.
It's up to me to clear it up.

16
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,200
Harvey and Cameron made a deal
to take you down.

17
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:35,932
And part of that deal
was that I got to be the one

18
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,100
to tell you about it.

19
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,745
If he can't practice law
in the country,

20
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:40,032
he can't be a member
of our firm.

21
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,688
You set this whole thing up.

22
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,723
Jessica set
this whole thing up.

23
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:46,425
And, Edward,
we may be getting a divorce,

24
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:49,028
but I fully intend on keeping
ownership of the house.

25
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,628
Oh, come on, just because
I have to wake up early

26
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,130
doesn't mean you
should suffer.

27
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:08,335
Well, you know
what they say.

28
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,449
The couple
that wakes together...

29
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,885
Bakes together?

30
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:15,955
- Stays together.
- Yeah, that doesn't rhyme.

31
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,141
You're ridiculous.

32
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,795
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

33
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:24,463
I know.

34
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:25,732
You're amazing.

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,734
I know.

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,359
You have no intention of
letting me go to work, do you?

37
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:41,280
There once was a girl
from Nantucket.

38
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:44,117
I love you.

39
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:45,484
Oh, that doesn't rhyme,
you know?

40
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,836
What are you,
the rhyming police now?

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,205
- You started it.
- And I'm gonna finish it.

42
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,591
I love you too.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,220
You look happier
than you did last night.

44
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:06,222
I am.

45
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,475
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,277
I was thinking
I'd give you a ride.

47
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,812
You just gave me a ride
last night.

48
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:15,231
Yeah, this time
I thought I'd join you.

49
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,516
Harvey,
we put in 15-hour days

50
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,701
12 feet from each other.

51
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,306
You really want
to go to work together?

52
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,021
Who said anything
about work?

53
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,406
We have breakfast
at Nougatine

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,575
and an excursion to Hermes
that may or may not

55
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,359
involve a new handbag.

56
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,629
You've been needing
a new handbag.

57
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,363
You can never have
too many handbags.

58
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:32,736
You're a woman
after my own heart.

59
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,584
Well, in that case...

60
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:42,008
Harvey...
Why are you doing this?

61
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,560
Donna, we've all
been through a lot.

62
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,397
We deserve
a little celebration.

63
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:50,433
Well, in that case,
you have had it pretty rough.

64
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,735
We're gonna need to get you
more than one handbag.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,572
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

66
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,585
Jessica.

67
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,588
Louis, what can I do
for you?

68
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,040
Actually, I'm not here
about me.

69
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:15,174
I'm here about you.

70
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,760
How so?

71
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:22,598
Um...

72
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:23,966
I want to handle
the dissolution.

73
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:25,685
So this is about you.

74
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:28,254
No.
Jessica...

75
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,857
I got Ava out
when you wanted her out.

76
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,608
I proved that I will do
whatever it takes.

77
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:35,094
And what's more,
I know Darby's assets,

78
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,146
and I will get you everything
that you have coming.

79
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,781
I can get everything
I have coming.

80
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,733
Maybe, but after
what Stephen Huntley

81
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,025
and Edward Darby did, you want
to exact a pound of flesh.

82
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:46,539
You want to kill them both.

83
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:47,940
What's your point?

84
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,911
My point is, is that you go
into that room angry,

85
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,078
you're gonna have blinders on.

86
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,080
And they're gonna lead you
any way they want you to go.

87
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,082
I get in that room,
I'm cool as a cucumber,

88
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,285
and I will lead whatever way
you want to go.

89
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:02,121
We just got Edward Darby's
proposed formula

90
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,789
for splitting our assets.

91
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,730
- Son of a bitch.
- I know!

92
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:12,682
He thinks he can dictate terms
after what he's done?

93
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,799
We need to crush him.

94
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,017
See?
Blinders.

95
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,519
What?

96
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,071
Louis was just suggesting
that he run the negotiations.

97
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,191
Louis also suggested the firm
adopt a badger as a mascot.

98
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:23,809
The badger is a noble
and fearsome creature,

99
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,695
but that's not the point.
I can beat them.

100
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,029
And the Washington Generals
think they can beat

101
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,498
the Globetrotters,
but they're not even

102
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:29,815
in the same league.

103
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,200
My father played
for the Washington Generals.

104
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,835
- See?
- So what are you saying?

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,370
I'm not in your league?
I'm saying you and I

106
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:35,821
don't even play the same sport.

107
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:38,758
Harvey...enough.
And Louis has a point.

108
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,659
You seriously want
to consider this?

109
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:41,794
This is a joke.

110
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:44,680
Louis, will you give us
a moment?

111
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,766
Please?

112
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,889
I am not a joke.

113
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:59,812
You can't do that anymore.

114
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,013
You mean make fun of Louis?

115
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,648
It's one of life's
great pleasures.

116
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,099
When the two of you
were colleagues,

117
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,185
that's fair game,
but you're a name partner now,

118
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,716
and you have to show him
some respect.

119
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,155
I am showing him respect.

120
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:12,858
I'm being dismissive
to his face.

121
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,328
Harvey, remember Kopelman?

122
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,413
Combovers like that
are hard to forget.

123
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:20,132
When I first started here,
he and I would fight

124
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,636
like cats and dogs every day,
toe-to-toe.

125
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:24,971
Then one day
he went too far.

126
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,223
He crossed a line,
and I'd had enough,

127
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,709
and I went in,
and I ripped him up.

128
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,378
You know what I did the day
after Daniel and I

129
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,597
took over the firm?

130
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:38,884
I went to Kopelman, and I told
him how much I valued him.

131
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,988
Kopelman never voted
against you

132
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,722
the whole time I knew him.

133
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,608
Exactly.

134
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,026
And by the way,
Louis is right.

135
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:50,196
Jessica, it's one thing for me
to show Louis respect.

136
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,832
But you want to put me
on the sidelines for him?

137
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,283
No.

138
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,669
I'm gonna put him in
at quarterback,

139
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,921
then snap the ball to you.

So let me get this straight.

150
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,461
You want to go after
their clients

151
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,837
so we get to count
those revenues.

152
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:36,511
Whoever has more revenue
is gonna determine

153
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,179
who gets what at the time
of closing.

154
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,664
Louis locks in
the settlement terms

155
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,216
while we tip the basis
for the settlement.

156
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,717
Exactly.

157
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,719
Some might say that's
negotiating in bad faith.

158
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,606
And I say Darby wasn't above
board when we got married.

159
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,508
Why should we be above board
when we're getting divorced?

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,893
And until the settlement
is done,

161
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,018
it's not stealing clients.

162
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,013
It's shifting
the attorney of record.

163
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,115
Wait a minute.

164
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,034
Did you think of this
all by yourself?

165
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,798
Why wouldn't I think of this
all by myself?

166
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,287
It was Jessica, wasn't it?

167
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,872
She thought of it
all by yourself.

168
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,690
The important thing right now
is to decide

169
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,158
which client to go after.

170
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,860
And to avoid my question
about whose idea it was.

171
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,579
- Exactly.
- Okay.

172
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,031
Well, if it's going to affect
the settlement calculations,

173
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,467
we're gonna need a big client
and we're gonna need a big one

174
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,885
who just took a loss.

175
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,803
Not necessarily.

176
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,222
You know who cries hardest
in the Miss America pageant?

177
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,091
- The runner-up.
- The winner...

178
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,143
Because she knows
she can't win again,

179
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,429
and winners always want
to win more.

180
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,598
Yeah.
That's not why they cry.

181
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,600
What's wrong with you?
Stay with me.

182
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,236
What we need is a huge company
that is still looking

183
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,571
to keep the crown.

184
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:41,743
Samsung.

185
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,995
- Get it going.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,897
Wait. Do you--
you actually watch

187
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,082
the Miss America pageant?

188
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,917
No, but I've celebrated
with the winner.

189
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,236
- Texas, Florida, New York?
- California.

190
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,589
Now, there's a question
you didn't want to avoid.

191
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,925
Exactly.

192
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,179
You wanted to see me?

193
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,682
- Yes, and it's important.
- What can I do for you?

194
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,884
Adjust the font
on the new business cards?

195
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,103
Order some pens?
I don't know.

196
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,688
If we don't have any pens,

197
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,806
what would you sign
the order with?

198
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,274
What do you want, Jessica?

199
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,609
I was just making
a little joke.

200
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,761
Oh, I thought I was
the only joke around here.

201
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:20,281
Louis, you are no joke.

202
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,650
And you're right.

203
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,953
You have been on the sidelines
far too long.

204
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,790
I want you to handle
the negotiations.

205
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,291
You won't be sorry.

206
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,493
You want a pound of flesh,

207
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,544
I'm gonna bring you
the whole carcass.

208
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,778
I believe you would,

209
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:35,130
but I'm going to ask you
to do something else.

210
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,248
- Anything you need.
- I need you to be fair.

211
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,304
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

212
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,724
<i>- That's one way to go.
- It's the way to go...</i>

213
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,143
Because I need them to think
that we're moving on,

214
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,645
when, in fact,
we're going after their clients.

215
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,464
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

216
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,100
You and Harvey are letting me in
on one of your missions?

217
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,569
This is Litt-tastic.
Louis, calm down.

218
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:58,770
Calm down?
No!

219
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,238
<i>This is just like
The Great Escape.</i>

220
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:01,740
You're recruiting me
to go behind enemy lines.

221
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,241
I'm Steve McQueen.

222
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,659
<i>- You know The Great Escape?
- Are you kidding?</i>

223
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,411
Charles Bronson grew up
in my grandmother's shtetl.

224
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:10,448
Then you know Steve McQueen
was the cooler king.

225
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,419
Louis, I need you to be
my cooler king.

226
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,755
Yeah, I am cool.

227
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,124
So you're authorizing me
to sign on your behalf?

228
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,993
Yes, but under
no circumstances

229
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,629
are you to lock in the existing
client allocations.

230
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,014
Please, I'd die
before that happens.

231
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,682
Let's hope it doesn't come
to that.

232
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,353
- Is that coconut water?
- Yeah.

233
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,838
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,169
I took some with me
this morning.

235
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,391
I hope you don't mind.

236
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,892
Why would I mind?
You needed the hydration.

237
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,145
You made me need
the hydration.

238
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,312
You're welcome.

239
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,688
- What?
- Nothing.

240
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,240
What?

241
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,492
Uh...

242
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,527
I just don't like
when you drink

243
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,413
from the bottles
in the refrigerator.

244
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,715
- But it's my bottle.
- The ones in my fridge aren't.

245
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,217
So you do mind
that I took it.

246
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:07,172
No, I mind that you drink
from the bottles in my fridge.

247
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,539
Okay.

248
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:13,094
And that you left your
coffee mug in the sink again.

249
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,596
I thought I was supposed
to put the mug in the sink.

250
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,598
Yes, on the right side.
The left side is for rinsing.

251
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,683
I can't rinse if there
are dishes piled on both sides.

252
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,384
I'll try and remember that.

253
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,721
You'd think a guy with your
memory wouldn't have to try.

254
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,774
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

255
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,408
- The list.
- What list?

256
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,693
Of things I do
that annoy you.

257
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,161
- I don't have a list.
- Everyone has a list.

258
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,746
- Do you have a list?
- This isn't about my list.

259
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,064
This is about your list.

260
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,033
No, it's about yours
because I just told you

261
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,400
everything that's on mine.

262
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,753
You're telling me
that the most meticulous woman

263
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,905
on the upper West Side
only has a list of two?

264
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,590
- That's not fair.
- No, what's not fair

265
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,342
is you making this
all about me.

266
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,461
I might not be perfect,
but neither are you.

267
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,513
So, excuse me, I have more
important things to do

268
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,350
than talk about where
I left my coffee cup.

269
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,885
- Fair?
- Fair.

270
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:57,605
- Fair?
- Yes, fair.

271
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,358
I didn't even like playing
nice in the sandbox.

272
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,442
Someone has better sand toys,

273
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,727
you take 'em.
Exactly.

274
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,262
And you don't ask
Bolshoi ballerinas

275
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:05,480
to dance the tango.

276
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,125
That would indeed
be blasphemy.

277
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,483
If Jessica wants compromise,

278
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,236
she should hire a mediator,
not a gladiator.

279
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,288
Except Jessica
doesn't want compromise.

280
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,740
She wants a stone-cold killer to
do one thing and one thing only.

281
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,158
And what is that?

282
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,794
Not to lock client allocations
till Harvey lands Samsung.

283
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,129
Then give me an order.

284
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,132
Your order is to not let
my inner gladiator

285
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,950
get past my outer negotiator.

286
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,969
That's not
gonna be easy, Louis.

287
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,773
You're like the Hulk--
once you get enraged,

288
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,222
there's no going back.

289
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,623
Though your description
of both my temperament

290
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,843
and physique is accurate,
the one thing that I have

291
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,145
on my side is that I have
no personal animus

292
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,230
against the other side.

293
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,939
Nesbitt.

294
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,858
Litt.

295
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,976
I see you're wearing
your checkered suit

296
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,477
with your crimson power tie.

297
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,113
You see correctly.

298
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:56,647
Looks like you came
to play hardball.

299
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:57,899
I didn't come
to play anything.

300
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,650
I came to win.
Well, I'm not here to win.

301
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm here to make sure we
hammer out a fair agreement.

302
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,621
And to help you achieve that,

303
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,706
I see you've brought along
Tinker Bell.

304
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,535
You were so scared
of Tinker Bell,

305
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,291
you sent her to Barcelona,
for your cat trial.

306
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,035
During which time,
she worked closely,

307
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,020
with a different senior partner...

308
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:16,241
again and again.

309
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,127
Don't worry.

310
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,462
Dr. Banner's
not turning green today.

311
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,215
See, whatever you thought was
gonna happen to me here isn't.

312
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,551
So go ahead,
wind me up all you want,

313
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,086
'cause I ain't losing my cool.

314
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,204
Fine.

315
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,557
This is my initial proposal.

316
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,897
Those are letters
I wrote to Mikado.

317
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,065
Unopened.

318
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,600
You never read them to her?

319
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:45,052
- Not a single word.
- You son of a bitch.

320
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,405
You think you can rattle me?
I'm un-rattleable.

321
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,741
Really?

322
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:52,527
This portrait
that you sent her.

323
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,948
Get out!

324
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,950
- Louis--
- I said go.

325
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,041
Oh, yeah, you and I
are going to war.

326
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:09,010
Everything's
on the goddamn table!

327
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:11,679
Including the existing
client list allocations?

328
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:15,016
Did you hear what I just said?
I said everything!

329
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,591
You son of a bitch.

330
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,193
You knew
I'd come after Samsung.

331
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,562
I knew what suit
you'd be wearing.

332
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,898
I know Tiger Woods
wears red on Sundays.

333
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,232
It doesn't mean
I can beat him.

334
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,202
I'm not going to let you poach
our clients, Harvey.

335
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,103
You poaching our clients
is what led us

336
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:38,406
to this goddamn merger
in the first place.

337
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:40,708
That was fair game.
This is bad faith.

338
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,110
Bad faith?
I'm going after Samsung.

339
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:45,522
I'm not murdering anybody and
lying about it to my partners.

340
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,048
Don't you dare put me in
with them.

341
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,633
You put yourself in
with them.

342
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:50,284
Speaking of which,
what the hell you still doing

343
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,786
in bed with these people,
Scottie?

344
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,339
As you know, I don't always
have the best judgment

345
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,840
of who I get in bed with.

346
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,508
And as for why I'm still
in business with them--

347
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:58,726
Let me guess.

348
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,845
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

349
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,063
you get your name on the door.

350
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,231
Yep.
Darby agreed to it

351
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:05,183
the second
that you pushed him out.

352
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,068
He only did that because
he knew when word got out

353
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:09,020
that his house was on fire,
he had to do something.

354
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:11,272
Well, he did.
He put me against you.

355
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,808
And as you just noted,
our house is on fire,

356
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,860
and I'm gonna fight tooth and
nail to put the damn thing out.

357
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,979
You can fight tooth and nail
all you like,

358
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,281
but it's never done a thing
for you against me before.

359
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:21,783
That's because I always
had something else

360
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,368
on my mind before,

361
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,287
but you've made it clear that
that's never going to happen.

362
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:27,655
So, if you think
you're gonna win this time,

363
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,424
you've got
another thing coming.

364
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:30,842
Say what you want, Scottie.

365
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:32,460
I'm going in there,
and you're not gonna stop me.

366
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,048
I'm afraid I already did.

367
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,683
Client list just got locked.

368
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,668
So you can go in there
and give it a shot,

369
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,886
but they're never gonna sign
with a guy

370
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,689
who just got played
on their front porch.

371
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:59,737
I got your message.

373
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,091
Thanks for meeting me.

374
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:03,510
It's not often I get invited
out to hear an apology.

375
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:07,046
I'm so sorry
I snapped at you.

376
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:11,217
I got defensive, and when I went
away to think about it,

377
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,436
I came up with why.

378
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,653
Why?

379
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:17,056
I feel like a guest
in your apartment.

380
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,409
And I think it's because
we spend all of our time

381
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:21,695
at your place and none
of the time at mine.

382
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,196
Yeah, but I told you,
when I'm at your place,

383
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,732
all I can picture is Tess
in a bedsheet.

384
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:28,902
I know.
And that's why we're here.

385
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,037
Come on, I want
to show you something.

386
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,927
Louis, we gave you one job,
and you blew it.

387
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,129
How the hell did you screw up
those negotiations?

388
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:40,413
Screw up? Come on.
What are you talking about?

389
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,431
I got us the corporate jet.

390
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:42,916
We keep
our first dividend checks,

391
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,134
and they pay
for our new letterhead.

392
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:45,435
So you know what?

393
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,020
You just put that in your pipe,
and you smoke it.

394
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:49,439
I don't give a shit
about the goddamn letterhead!

395
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:50,891
You don't think
I know that?

396
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,643
Nobody cares about
the goddamn letterhead, okay?

397
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:55,195
Nigel went after Mikado.

398
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,813
What the hell is Mikado?

399
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:58,315
Not "what," "who."
She's a cat.

400
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,950
He went after your cat?

401
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,368
He went after his cat.

402
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:05,071
He tortured his cat?

403
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:08,542
He deprived her
of my letters.

404
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:14,047
Louis, you lost your shit
during a negotiation

405
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,449
because someone didn't read
your letters to their cat?

406
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:20,220
Harvey, please.
I'm sorry I lost my head.

407
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,622
I don't even remember
signing the agreement.

408
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,891
Well, you did!

409
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,510
And, Louis,
you've been asking Jessica

410
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,127
to give you the ball
instead of me

411
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,146
ever since the day I met you.

412
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,630
Well, she gave it to you,

413
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,234
and you just went and scored
a touchdown for the other team.

414
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:48,815
Oh, my God.

415
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,917
Your grandmother's apartment.

416
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:53,370
I still own it.

417
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:57,424
You kept it
this entire time?

418
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:59,709
I couldn't rent it.

419
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:00,877
I couldn't sell it.

420
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:03,013
I...

421
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:04,464
Couldn't even come here.

422
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,516
That means the last time
you were here...

423
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,852
We were here.

424
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,520
So you want to move in here?

425
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,522
I want us to move in here.

426
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:17,310
- Mike--
- Rachel.

427
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,813
I've only ever been here twice,

428
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:23,016
and both times were with you.

429
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,485
The first time we stood here,

430
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:28,855
and we pictured
living together.

431
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:31,408
I'll never forget that.

432
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:34,878
- Neither will I.
- And the second time...

433
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:38,048
Was one of the hardest days
of my life,

434
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,918
but I got through it
because we were together.

435
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,894
That's one the sweetest things
I've ever heard.

436
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:58,518
You don't have to answer
right now, okay?

437
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,322
I just wanted to show you
what we could have.

438
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,948
Goddamn Louis.

439
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,566
Let it go.

440
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:14,951
Let it go?

441
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,503
You don't say "let it go"

442
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,755
unless you already
didn't let it go.

443
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,374
You gonna take it out on me
for taking it out on him?

444
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:23,176
At the moment,
we don't have the time.

445
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:24,711
Good, because
I've already got Mike

446
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,596
looking for ways
to revise the agreement.

447
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,014
The problem
isn't revising it.

448
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:29,966
The problem is
Louis already signed it.

449
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,685
You're saying
we need to find a loophole.

450
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:32,936
I am.

451
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,554
Well, if we can't steal
from their clients

452
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,523
and the revenues from new ones
don't count,

453
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,058
what the hell
are we supposed to do?

454
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:39,693
There's only one thing
to do--

455
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
look at the money
we're already owed.

456
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:43,780
- I don't follow you.
- We're on a cash basis.

457
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,432
We can't count the revenues
we haven't collected yet.

458
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:49,268
But if we can entice someone
to pay us sooner,

459
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,288
we can get that revenue in
under the window.

460
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,939
Bad faith--
I like it.

461
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,831
The question is,
who still owes us enough money

462
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:56,275
to make a difference?

463
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:57,443
Folsom Foods.

464
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,778
The second they pay
their settlement,

465
00:18:58,829 --> 00:18:59,996
we get paid our fee.

466
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:01,464
You came to that
all on your own.

467
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,250
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Don't tell me I beat you to it.

468
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,302
Maybe. But you didn't have
Harvey slowing you down.

469
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,171
- That's a fair point.
- Okay, I'm right here.

470
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:09,956
Well, your idea is no good,

471
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,474
because it'll be
a cold day in hell

472
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,010
before Daniel Hardman lifts
a finger to help this firm,

473
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,179
and I'd rather lose
this negotiation

474
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:17,983
than to cut a deal
with that son of a bitch.

475
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:20,133
You don't have to.
Hardman was running point.

476
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,802
Folsom's not his client.
They're Robert Zane's.

477
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:25,438
- He's no fan of us either.
- Maybe not.

478
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:29,025
But we can handle
Robert Zane.

479
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:33,146
You caught on
to my plan there.

480
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:35,148
You mean the most obvious
plan in the world?

481
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,279
I mean the plan that
I thought of and that you didn't

482
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,152
and that I'm the perfect
person to implement.

483
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:41,254
You really think
you can handle Robert Zane?

484
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,622
I have a relationship
with him.

485
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:43,990
Yeah. You're sleeping
with his daughter.

486
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,508
I'm sure
he's your biggest fan.

487
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:48,678
Okay, it's not like that.
I had dinner at the man's house.

488
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,046
I had dinner
at the White House.

489
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:51,664
They're not gonna make me
Attorney General.

490
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:53,332
Okay, first of all,
bullshit.

491
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,985
Second of all,
do you have a better idea?

492
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,335
No, I don't.

493
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,271
But are you ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

494
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,689
to get her father to turn?

495
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,691
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

496
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:03,810
I'm just gonna use it
to get him to hear me out

497
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,563
in the first place.
Good luck with that.

498
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:10,567
Hey, how'd you know that
White House thing was bullshit?

499
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:21,027
Mike. I was wondering when
I was gonna get you out here.

500
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,361
Ah, golf isn't really
my thing.

501
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,497
What is your thing?

502
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:26,699
- Sports.
- You're telling me

503
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,718
you're one of those guys
that doesn't think

504
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:30,253
golf is a sport?
Of course not.

505
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,223
I can tell you're an athlete
just by looking at you, sir.

506
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:35,592
With an attitude like that,
you must be here on business.

507
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,060
- Folsom Foods.
- Ah...

508
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,212
You're gonna stick that loss
in my face?

509
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,431
No, I'm here to make
that loss sting a little less.

510
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:43,883
You move up your payment
by one fiscal quarter,

511
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,403
we'll take a 10% haircut
on our fee.

512
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,822
- 10% is a little light.
- All right.

513
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,241
I'll cut right to it.
I can go as high as 20%.

514
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,391
Are you saying 20%?

515
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,227
Yes.

516
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,729
Then I'm saying no.

517
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:59,416
Sir, this...
This is a win for you.

518
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,668
No, this isn't shit
for me.

519
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:04,337
This is about Harvey Specter
and Jessica Pearson

520
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:05,905
and their divorce negotiations.

521
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:08,241
And you don't go
to the one you didn't marry

522
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,959
to stick it
to the one you did.

523
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:12,078
We could go
straight to your client.

524
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:13,746
By the time
they accepted the offer,

525
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,298
it'd be too late.

526
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,250
You just gave that away
when you went straight to 20%.

527
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,602
I went straight to 20%
out of respect.

528
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:22,639
Now you're repaying me
by being a--

529
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:23,923
What?

530
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:25,725
You don't have the balls
to say it.

531
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,143
I will.

532
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:29,428
A dick.
I'm being a dick.

533
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,598
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

534
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,903
I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

535
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,788
I just wonder
what your daughter's gonna think

536
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,707
when she finds out
you screwed over your own client

537
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,492
just to stick it
to the man she loves.

538
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:44,443
She loves Harvey Specter.

539
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,379
No.

540
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:50,049
But when you go after Harvey,
you go after me.

541
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:04,550
The Whooping Crane
of Manchuria.

542
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:07,266
- It's my calming animal.
- You've chosen well.

543
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,487
What can I do for you,
Katrina?

544
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,639
- I never heard back from you.
- About what?

545
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,140
About anything...

546
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,860
Especially what we're going
to do about negotiations.

547
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:19,662
There's no more negotiation.

548
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:21,497
I had one assignment,
and I blew it.

549
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,983
Louis, the opera isn't over
until the fat lady sings.

550
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,453
No, this is not the opera.

551
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,205
It's football.

552
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,539
Harvey said it.

553
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:32,124
They gave me the ball.

554
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:33,793
I scored a touchdown
for the other team,

555
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:35,010
it's the eighth inning,

556
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:37,129
and there's no more time
left on the clock.

557
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,798
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

558
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:40,332
It's the fact.
There's nothing we can do.

559
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,517
I signed the agreement,

560
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,102
and Nigel's
never gonna reopen it.

561
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:46,839
Well, then I guess it's
a good thing I found a loophole.

562
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,391
What are you talking about?

563
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:50,025
We can't steal
their clients,

564
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,228
but we can still increase
our revenue.

565
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:53,846
No. New clients
don't count.

566
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,364
I'm not talking
about new clients.

567
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:58,350
I'm talking about new revenue
from clients we already have.

568
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,653
Well, that's operating
in complete bad faith.

569
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,750
Now, what clients
are you talking about.

570
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,492
First, I got you something.

571
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:08,694
Okay, Katrina,
you know what?

572
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,414
I really don't have time
for sentimental--

573
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,886
The trademark came through
ten minutes ago.

574
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,255
I...
Don't know what to say.

575
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,840
Say you forgive me

576
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,641
for letting you
lose control of Nigel.

577
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:26,562
I do.

578
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:31,734
Now, let's go get
some goddamn new revenue.

579
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,361
You.

580
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,696
How'd you get in here?

581
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:45,564
'Cause I know
how to get things done.

582
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:46,899
You didn't
the last time we met.

583
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,400
Last time you saw me
coming a mile away.

584
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,119
This time,
I'm blindsiding you.

585
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,907
- I didn't know we were at war.
- We're not.

586
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,425
It's just a training exercise.

587
00:23:58,077 --> 00:23:59,762
These are my personal
bank statements.

588
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,764
You stole my money.

589
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:03,382
No, not stole...

590
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,583
Relocated.

591
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,602
- I could have you arrested.
- You could.

592
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:09,472
But then you'd be missing out
on all this...

593
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:14,059
Tax shelter in the Caymans,

594
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,430
carried interest classification
for your personal holdings,

595
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,148
blind irrevocable trust for up
to six of your unborn children.

596
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:20,983
- And this means...
- You'll never pay

597
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:22,651
a nickel in taxes
your entire life,

598
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,456
not to mention your money
will be too secure

599
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:27,823
for someone to do
what I just did.

600
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,608
How'd you do all this?

601
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,293
Well, you said you'd call us
for the paperwork.

602
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:33,329
This is how I do paperwork.
Oh, and one last thing--

603
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:35,130
that Ferrari
that your ex-wife took?

604
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:37,333
Yeah?

605
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,168
I got it back.

606
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:43,672
You're hired.

607
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:48,511
Don't you need to get
board approval?

608
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,646
To be my personal attorney?

609
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,297
No, for
Gianopolous Limited Holdings

610
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:54,967
to expand their relationship
with us.

611
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,652
- Are you crazy?
- How is that crazy?

612
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,404
I just showed you
what I'm capable of.

613
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:00,689
You showed me you could beat
a tribe of Visigoths.

614
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:03,075
You want me to give you control
of the Roman Empire?

615
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:05,411
I can handle
the Roman Empire.

616
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:06,862
Even if you could,

617
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:09,532
from Mr. Gianopolous's
perspective,

618
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,867
you're a nobody.

619
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:17,322
Please, can you at least find
a way to convince him?

620
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,157
I'm sorry.

621
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,593
If I bring your name
up to him,

622
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,294
he will laugh me
out of the room.

623
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,772
That's a check
from Folsom Foods.

624
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,941
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

625
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,777
Holy shit.
That's all of it.

626
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:41,447
It's hard to believe that
you could get Zane to do this

627
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:43,034
without using
his daughter against him.

628
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,683
Maybe I'm
an excellent negotiator.

629
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,285
If you're
an excellent negotiator,

630
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:48,353
this wouldn't include
a 20% haircut.

631
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:50,406
It would be 10%,
like I would have gotten.

632
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,291
You? He wouldn't have
even talked to you.

633
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:55,027
Like you're not talking
to me right now?

634
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:56,962
What'd you say to Zane?

635
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,532
Let's just say we may have
gotten what we wanted, but...

636
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:03,002
My girlfriend's dad's gonna be
pissed at me for a little while.

637
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,421
Then you're a better
negotiator than I thought.

638
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:26,275
I never should have
given you my key.

639
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,077
And I never
should have forgotten

640
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,395
that you'll stop at nothing
to beat me.

641
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,897
No, you shouldn't have.

642
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:33,248
Harvey...

643
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,167
The man that I knew
may have fought to the death,

644
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,536
but he always operated
in good faith.

645
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:40,089
I told you, I am not bound
by good faith on this deal

646
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:41,624
after what your boss did.

647
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,792
It's not just Edward's firm.

648
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:45,010
What does that
have to do with it?

649
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,399
What does that
have to do with it?

650
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:48,263
You shrunk the whole pie
for the sole purpose

651
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:50,015
of getting a bigger piece
for yourself,

652
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,523
and it screwed me,
along with Edward.

653
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:53,686
What do you want, Scottie?

654
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:55,688
I want you to exclude
the Folsom Foods payments

655
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,806
from the settlement
calculations.

656
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,976
And why would I do that?

657
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,561
Because I need you to.

658
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:05,364
I'm afraid that's not enough.

659
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,818
You, uh--
you came to me.

660
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,320
You needed help
with Ava Hessington

661
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:13,489
after you sent me back
to London.

662
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,053
You said that I mean
something to you,

663
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:18,160
that I'll--I'll always
mean something to you.

664
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,295
Was that bullshit or not?
It wasn't bullshit,

665
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,081
and if you're in trouble
personally--

666
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:24,583
I am in trouble personally.
You said so yourself.

667
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:28,120
Our house is on fire,
and it's my job to put it out.

668
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:29,805
If you crush me...

669
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,590
I'll have nothing.

670
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,559
That's not personal.
That's business.

671
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:35,310
Okay,
let's talk business.

672
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:38,480
You made a career out
of putting I.O.U.s in the bank.

673
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:40,315
Do the same thing right now.

674
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,068
Put an I.O.U. in with me.

675
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:44,302
And what's to stop you

676
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:47,823
from still trying
to screw me after that?

677
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,775
My word that I won't.

678
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:59,201
He asked you
to move in together?

679
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:00,819
- I know. It's...
- Quick?

680
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:06,764
I was going to say
that it's a-a big step,

681
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:08,066
because it's not
really that quick.

682
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,617
We've known each other
for a while.

683
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,070
Yes, but you only
just started dating.

684
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:13,988
So I guess that means
you're against it.

685
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:16,290
Rachel,
I'm not against it.

686
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,708
You told me that you love him,

687
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,494
and I couldn't be happier
for you.

688
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:22,580
But you got a lot
going on right now.

689
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:24,832
You don't even know where
you're gonna go to law school.

690
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,283
I'm just saying

691
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:28,920
maybe you don't want to rush
into this so quickly.

692
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:31,255
Rush into what?

693
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:39,347
Well, Mike asked me
to move in with him.

694
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,349
Move in with him?

695
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,851
Shit, what's he gonna
do to me then?

696
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:46,604
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't hear?

697
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,156
He came to me
on the golf course.

698
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,690
To ask for permission?

699
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,161
No, he didn't ask for shit.

700
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,646
I got to hand it to him.
The boy's got some balls.

701
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,532
- What?
- He kicked my ass.

702
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,450
Didn't even have the courtesy
to give me a--

703
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,785
- Robert!
- Oh, come on.

704
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:03,287
She's gonna be a lawyer.
Gonna hear a lot worse.

705
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,339
Dad, what are you talking
about--what happened?

706
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:08,126
He wanted an advance
on the Folsom settlement.

707
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:10,261
And he put the screws to me
to get it.

708
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,763
He put the screws
to you how?

709
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:20,638
Rachel.
This is a surprise.

710
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,141
What happened to--
Tess in a bedsheet?

711
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:27,011
It was replaced by the image
of you manipulating my dad.

712
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:28,846
Okay, I did not manipulate
your dad.

713
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,565
How exactly
would you describe it?

714
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,034
I didn't go there
to manipulate him, all right?

715
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,479
He--he was about to make
a decision

716
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,320
that was going to affect him,
us, and his client,

717
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:37,572
and I just pointed that out
to him.

718
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:39,123
And then when
that didn't work,

719
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:40,524
you pointed out
that I wouldn't approve.

720
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:41,542
He was bullying me.

721
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:44,629
So you used me
to bully him back.

722
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,248
I was talking to my mom
about moving in with you

723
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,001
when I found out about this.
Okay, Rachel...

724
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:52,503
I'm sorry, all right?

725
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,388
Let me call him right now.
I'll apologize to him--

726
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:55,640
Him?

727
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:57,592
He loved it!
He did?

728
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,510
Yeah, he thought
you had balls.

729
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,679
- So then what's the problem?
- Are you not listening to me?

730
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,547
I was thinking
about moving in with you,

731
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,766
and then I find out
that you go to my dad--

732
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,235
Wait, wait, wait.
Are--

733
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,570
are you saying
this changes everything?

734
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:11,939
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?

735
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:13,557
Forget--I don't even want
to get into this

736
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:15,109
with you right now!
Rachel, if you don't want

737
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:16,560
to live with me,
why don't you just tell me

738
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:19,780
you don't want to live with me?
I didn't say that.

739
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:21,699
Well, do you?

740
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:29,957
You said I could have
some time, so...

741
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:34,795
I just need some time.

742
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:53,814
You excluded
the Folsom Foods payment

743
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,599
from the revenue totals
on this.

744
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:57,735
It's a draft document.
I haven't showed it to anyone.

745
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,103
I just wanted
to run it by you.

746
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:01,072
Well, what reason
could you possibly have

747
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,823
for wanting to do it at all?

748
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:04,492
Because Scottie
came to me and asked,

749
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,127
and I think
it's good business.

750
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:07,451
Well, your idea
of good business

751
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:08,779
is different from mine,

752
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,415
because we already took
less money from Folsom Foods,

753
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:13,551
and now you want us to take
less money from Darby.

754
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:16,120
Jessica,
if we screw him over,

755
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:17,805
he's gonna come back at us.

756
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:19,123
It might not be tomorrow.

757
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,675
It might not be six months
from now,

758
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,426
but he's gonna find a way.

759
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:24,679
- You mean she'll find a way.
- That's exactly what I mean.

760
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:26,314
And maybe she will.

761
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:28,632
But I've never known you
to run from a fight before.

762
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:30,634
My name was never
on the door before.

763
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:32,770
You said it yourself.

764
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:36,107
I have to think differently
now that I'm in this position.

765
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:37,808
I did say that.

766
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,327
And it's not just gonna
be one fight.

767
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:42,079
It's gonna be the Hatfields
and the McCoys all over again.

768
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:45,316
Are you sure this isn't really
about your history with her?

769
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,536
- What if it is?
- She could just be playing us.

770
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,989
She could, but...
I trust her.

771
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,492
Jessica,
it's time to turn the page.

772
00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:00,381
Well, I don't want
to turn the page.

773
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,967
I want to close the book.

774
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:06,670
Tell her we'll exclude
the payment and honor our deal.

775
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:15,196
Louis, I know it didn't go
exactly as planned,

776
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,232
but you need to pick yourself up
and dust yourself off.

777
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,017
Exactly as planned?

778
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,236
I utterly failed.

779
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,188
I don't even deserve
this stupid mug.

780
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,990
"Litt Up"?
It should say "shit up."

781
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,541
You didn't fail.
You impressed him.

782
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:30,745
Yeah, that and $45 will get
my cat a Brazilian bikini wax.

783
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,079
You got a new cat?

784
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,697
Fostering.

785
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,800
Louis...enough.

786
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:38,336
You need to go to Harvey.

787
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:40,888
You mean tell him that I'm
even more of an embarrassment

788
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,539
than he says I am?

789
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,342
You're not an embarrassment.

790
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,344
You may need Harvey
to put the ball in the end zone,

791
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,928
but you had the idea,
you set it up,

792
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,381
and you drove the ball
down to the one-yard line.

793
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,266
No, I didn't have the idea.

794
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:53,768
You had the idea!

795
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,820
And you executed it.

796
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,438
But you're giving me credit.

797
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,723
If Harvey executes this,
he'll give you credit.

798
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:01,409
No, he won't.
He never does.

799
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:03,110
Louis, he might.

800
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:05,413
You want him to see
a different side of you,

801
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:07,564
give him a chance to show
a different side of him.

802
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,450
You know what?
It doesn't matter anyway.

803
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,369
Harvey doesn't need
my help anymore.

804
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,237
It's too late.
No, it isn't.

805
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,039
Haven't you heard?

806
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,291
Heard what?

807
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:35,276
Harvey,
I have some bad news.

808
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,478
- What is it?
- I think you should sit down.

809
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,947
Donna, unless someone died,
I don't need to sit down.

810
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,284
Just tell me.
Hessington Oil just fired us.

811
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,610
- Scottie betrayed me.
- You don't know that.

812
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:54,745
One plus one equals two,
Donna.

813
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:56,464
And I know
how to goddamn add.

814
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:57,798
I didn't count
the Folsom money,

815
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,967
and suddenly
our oil revenues are gone

816
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,136
and her piece of the pie
just skyrocketed.

817
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,121
Harvey, please,
don't do anything rash.

818
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,123
What the hell
are you saying?

819
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,342
- I'm saying call her.
- How would that go?

820
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:10,144
"Hey, Scottie,
thanks for dicking me over.

821
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,479
Could you please
take it back?"

822
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,097
You don't know
how it would go.

823
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:15,316
And you could find out
if you would drop your pride

824
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,080
and just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

825
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:19,136
You gave someone
the benefit of the doubt,

826
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,738
and look how that turned out.

827
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,942
You think just because
you bought me a handbag,

828
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:27,912
you can say that to me?

829
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,613
Okay, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

830
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,198
But I just got played,

831
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:34,034
and I'm not about to call
Scottie and cry about it.

832
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,120
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

833
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:38,706
how to do to her
what she just did to me.

834
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:47,959
- Harvey.
- Not now, Louis.

835
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,491
Yes, now, Harvey.
I've got the answer.

836
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:50,813
- The answer to what?
- To shoving

837
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,828
the Hessington Oil firing
up Edward Darby's ass.

838
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:54,782
Harvey.

839
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,483
Harvey!

840
00:34:57,986 --> 00:34:59,754
Tony Gianopolous.

841
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,423
He can triple the revenue
we lost with Hessington Oil.

842
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,825
And they're technically
not a new client.

843
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,844
So there's nothing
Scottie can do.

844
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:08,346
Well, what makes you think
he's gonna go for it?

845
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,831
Because I went there,
and they are primed to say yes.

846
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:13,684
They just won't...

847
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,637
They just won't
say yes to me.

848
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:20,057
Give him this.
They'll say yes to you.

849
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:27,481
Louis, this is brilliant.

850
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,151
And if you hadn't had the balls
to come to me,

851
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,652
we'd have nothing
right now.

852
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,120
Harvey, no.

853
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,572
I should have come
to you sooner,

854
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,523
but I didn't because I just--
Louis.

855
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:38,326
I've told you this before,

856
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:41,028
but it's always been when
I needed something from you.

857
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,864
And I don't need anything
from you right now,

858
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,366
because you just gave it to me.

859
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:48,836
So maybe you can hear it
when I say it--

860
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:52,173
I respect you.

861
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:54,041
You're an excellent attorney,

862
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,928
a valuable member
of this firm.

863
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,398
And a friend?

864
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:02,216
Don't push it.

865
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,386
Sorry.

866
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:09,273
Seriously, Harvey,
I just have to say, um...

867
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,361
It means so much
when you say all that.

868
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:14,779
Do you need a tissue
or something?

869
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:16,914
- Can I use your pocket square?
- Under no circumstances.

870
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:19,333
I'll be fine.
And you and Jessica

871
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:21,752
need to take that over
to Gianopolous right now.

872
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:24,738
Screw that.
I'm going over there with you.

873
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,130
He's not there.

874
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:34,382
What?
Where is he?

875
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,583
He went to see
Tony Gianopolous.

876
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:38,636
- By himself?
- No, with Louis.

877
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,888
With Louis?
What, is he mad at me?

878
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:42,940
Rachel's the only one
who's mad at you.

879
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:45,810
- She told you.
- She didn't have to.

880
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,311
What were you thinking,

881
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:48,779
pulling all that shit
with her dad?

882
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:50,448
I didn't think
it would come to that.

883
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:51,983
He didn't mind.
Why should she?

884
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,486
Anyone who understands women
in any way

885
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,788
would know that was
a bad idea from the start.

886
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,957
- Harvey liked it.
- Proving my point.

887
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:04,962
I asked her
to move in with me.

888
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,280
I know.

889
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:07,448
She told you?

890
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:08,949
Of course she did.

891
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,118
I can't intuit everything.
What am I, the Dalai Lama?

892
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:13,337
Donna, you should have seen
her face when I asked her.

893
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:15,423
She was so happy.

894
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:17,124
I'm sure she was.
It was very romantic.

895
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:19,343
How could she be so happy
and then just not want to do it?

896
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:21,795
Who says
she doesn't want to do it?

897
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,630
I told her to take her time,

898
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,632
but I-I didn't think
she'd need it.

899
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:27,485
Why wouldn't she need it?

900
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:29,570
Just because you made
some romantic gesture

901
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:31,822
doesn't mean that all reason
goes out the window.

902
00:37:31,907 --> 00:37:33,574
I've had a pit in my stomach
since last night.

903
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,076
I...

904
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,111
I need to do something.

905
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:39,646
You need to look
in the mirror.

906
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:41,115
What?

907
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,137
I just jumped into
a relationship with a man

908
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,503
who, it turns out,

909
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:47,338
was pretending to be
something he wasn't.

910
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:48,839
Rachel already knows

911
00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:51,509
that you're pretending to be
something you're not.

912
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:53,344
All you need to do
is just give her time

913
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:54,828
to figure it all out.

914
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:58,766
What if she says no?

915
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,718
Then she says no.

916
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:04,438
But pushing her isn't going
to stop that from happening.

917
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:11,024
If you're here to complain
about Hessington Oil,

918
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,229
I had nothing to do with it.

919
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:13,481
I'm just
the majority shareholder.

920
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,700
I don't get involved
in day-to-day stuff.

921
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:18,235
- We're not here to complain.
- We're here to bring a gift.

922
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,870
The question is,
what do you get a man

923
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:21,739
who can burn a $50,000 bond?

924
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,375
Something money can't buy.

925
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:29,363
- This isn't public.
- It will be in 48 hours.

926
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:31,698
And it's legal now.
How do you know that?

927
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,217
Because I structured it
that way.

928
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,003
I can do more of the same
for you, but he didn't tell you,

929
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:38,038
because I wasn't enough
of a name.

930
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,341
- You're not.
- But I am.

931
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,876
Well, you are, as a man
who shoots from the hip,

932
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:44,061
which I like, but--

933
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:46,013
You also need
a stabilizing influence.

934
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:48,766
- Not a football player.
- But a fan of the ballet.

935
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,935
- Muscle.
- And finesse.

936
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,154
And you guys think
that I'm not aware

937
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,272
that this is all
about your merger negotiations.

938
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:56,657
Oh, I was counting on you
being aware of it.

939
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:57,908
Because then
you'll also be aware

940
00:38:57,993 --> 00:38:59,360
that we can be very flexible
in our billings.

941
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:01,078
As long as I pay
enough up front

942
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:02,830
to tip the scales
in your favor.

943
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:04,365
We'll structure
a schedule that results

944
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,066
in you getting a substantial
financial benefit.

945
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:07,701
Which is his specialty.

946
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:09,203
Go ahead.
Tell him.

947
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:11,172
He's a badass.

948
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:15,426
What do you say we celebrate
our new association

949
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,295
over dinner in Chicago
with Michael Jordan?

950
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,097
We can take my private jet.

951
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:22,099
Hey! Which will allow us
to pay for it

952
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:23,750
and for you to write it off.

953
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:39,150
Hey.

954
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,601
Hey.

955
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:42,653
I know you're probably
busy...

956
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:44,405
I'm actually not.

957
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:54,114
Look, Rachel, I...

958
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,916
I know that dating me
is complicated--

959
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:57,418
- Mike--
- I just--

960
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:02,756
I just want you to know you can
take as much time as you need.

961
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:08,095
I love you.

962
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:13,567
I love you too.

963
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:21,808
I got into Stanford.

964
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,172
What the hell
is wrong with you?

965
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:37,157
I see you got
my little gut punch.

966
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,660
I came to you hat in hand,
and this is what you do--

967
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:41,295
stack the numbers?
- Hat in hand?

968
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:43,214
More like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

969
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:45,850
- What are you talking about?
- Hessington Oil.

970
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,184
I had nothing
to do with that.

971
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,220
Something dropped
from the sky,

972
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:50,604
tilted everything
in your favor

973
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:52,890
right after I cut you a break?
I don't think so.

974
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:55,559
Harvey, I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

975
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:57,010
Bullshit.
You're just saying that

976
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:58,302
because I've got
the upper hand.

977
00:40:58,313 --> 00:40:59,647
This is not
about the upper hand.

978
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:01,059
You're always
about the upper hand!

979
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:02,849
Harvey, stop.

980
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,569
I came to you
and asked for mercy.

981
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:07,571
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

982
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,990
And then for me to turn around
and use that to dupe you--

983
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,992
how could you think
I would do that?

984
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:13,244
Well, what would you
have thought?

985
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:15,079
I don't know,
but you could have called me.

986
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:16,863
- And say what?
- And asked me

987
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:18,499
to exclude the firing
from the calculations.

988
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,533
I'm not gonna do--

989
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,034
What?
You're not gonna do what?

990
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:22,726
Not gonna give me
the benefit of the doubt

991
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:25,472
and be vulnerable--
expose yourself?

992
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,708
I already did that
when I trusted you.

993
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:31,262
That was mercy, which is
from a position of strength.

994
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:34,398
Being vulnerable is
from a position of weakness.

995
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,400
Well,
I'm not gonna do that.

996
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:41,906
Well, then I guess
I'm not going to either.

997
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,724
Meaning what?

998
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:46,744
Meaning that I am not going
to dissolve this merger.

999
00:41:46,828 --> 00:41:48,412
You already signed
the agreement.

1000
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:50,080
Then sue me.

1001
00:41:50,165 --> 00:41:52,232
You're gonna totally
shaft me anyway.

1002
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:53,400
What's my downside?

1003
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,786
In the meantime,
you'll have a name partner

1004
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,071
who can't practice in America,
whose reputation is shit,

1005
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:00,203
and who's gonna tie up
all your profits in litigation

1006
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,425
for the next five years.

1007
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:03,377
You're willing
to do all that

1008
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:05,596
and expect me to believe
you weren't behind

1009
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,431
us getting fired
in the first place.

1010
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:08,915
She's telling the truth,
Harvey.

1011
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,447
- What?
- Scottie didn't get us fired.

1012
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:12,252
Ava Hessington did.
That doesn't mean anything.

1013
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:13,754
Scottie
could have arranged it.

1014
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,222
Well, she didn't,

1015
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:16,807
because Ava
didn't just fire us.

1016
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:19,593
She's suing all of us...

1017
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:21,595
for malpractice.
