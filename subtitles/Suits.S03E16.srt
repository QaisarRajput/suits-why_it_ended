1
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:03,810
- I wanna go legit.
- You can't.

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,712
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:07,817
and just put me in there
just like she did with Harvard.

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:09,402
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

5
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,954
you don't move
the goddamn body.

6
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:12,855
Harvey, I'm stuck.

7
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:15,124
I can't live my whole life
like this.

8
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:16,493
We're investment bankers.

9
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:18,694
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

10
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:19,963
Just admit it,
you want me to take the job,

11
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,214
but you're too afraid
to say it.

12
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:22,865
I want you to take the job.

13
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,201
You and your associate
conspired with Harold Gunderson

14
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:27,253
to file a lawsuit
against your own clients.

15
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:28,671
That is a bribe.

16
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:30,089
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

17
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:31,090
with Harold Gunderson.

18
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,675
You need to call
Lola Jensen.

19
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:34,394
You said it yourself,
hacking into the bar

20
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,145
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

21
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:38,348
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail,

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,149
and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

23
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,351
You're letting Mike
walk out the door

24
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,485
without trying to stop him,

25
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:43,820
and anytime I ask you
about anything

26
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:46,773
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

27
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:48,391
Mike is gone, Harvey.

28
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:49,559
The jeopardy's gone too.

29
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,860
And now you wanna tell someone

30
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,162
who keeps finding a reason
to be pissed at you,

31
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,164
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

32
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:56,583
and it's not the last time.

33
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,167
You took money
from our client's competitors

34
00:00:58,235 --> 00:00:59,902
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

35
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:01,237
The penalty
is being disbarred.

36
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:03,590
Being a lawyer
is what I am.

37
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:05,174
And if you take that away--

38
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,175
It's up to you.

39
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,877
I'll drop the suit.

40
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm officially a member
of the New York bar.

41
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,747
You went to Lola?

42
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,551
I want to stay.

43
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,609
I'd bring in champagne,

44
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:23,943
but after
all we've been through,

45
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:26,479
I think scotch
seems more appropriate.

46
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,481
Does it?

47
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,785
Harvey, we've had
this conversation once.

48
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,537
If you want someone
who doesn't speak their mind,

49
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:36,706
I'm not that person.

50
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:37,957
I know.

51
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:41,077
And Mike staying
doesn't change my opinion.

52
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:43,913
Telling Scottie about him
is a mistake.

53
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:46,666
I know.

54
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,117
Then why are you
being so quiet?

55
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,670
Someone who keeps finding
a way to be pissed at me,

56
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,672
and it's not the third time
or the fifth time

57
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:54,057
or the last time.

58
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:56,476
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- Yeah, well, you did.

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,144
Because you forced it
out of me.

60
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,099
Donna, do you want me
and Scottie to succeed or not?

61
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,101
I want you to be happy.

62
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,153
- That's an evasive answer.
- No, it isn't.

63
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:10,106
Just isn't up to me
to decide what that means.

64
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,529
Now are we gonna drink
to Mike staying or what?

65
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:18,948
Give me that.

66
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,034
Not that one.

67
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:22,118
The bigger one.

68
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,319
Seriously?

69
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,821
[Glasses clink]

70
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,503
I'm so glad you're home.

72
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:42,689
I made dinner
because I want to celebrate.

73
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:46,309
I'm not taking the job.

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,393
What?

75
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:49,145
I went to see Harvey,

76
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:51,347
and, um...

77
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,449
I told him that I'm staying.

78
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:59,288
What about the fact
that it was eating you up?

79
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,357
Look, Rachel, I know
this isn't what you wanted.

80
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:02,525
What I wanted?

81
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,377
I didn't wanna give you
my opinion at all,

82
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,745
but you forced it out of me,

83
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,914
and then you told me that you
were gonna take the job.

84
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:08,998
Okay, Rachel--

85
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,249
No, and now
you come in here,

86
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,634
and you tell me
you're gonna stay a fraud.

87
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:13,386
- A lawyer.
- A fraud.

88
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:18,808
What happened
to accepting me for who I am?

89
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,511
What happened
to you taking the job?

90
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,483
It was a way out.

91
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,569
You said you were afraid
if you told me your opinion,

92
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,270
I'd hold it against you,

93
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:35,108
but now that I'm not doing
what you told me to,

94
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,325
you're holding it
against me.

95
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:37,326
I am.

96
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:38,745
Yeah, that's not fair.

97
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,613
I wanna know what changed

98
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,565
from when you told me you were
gonna take the job to now.

99
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,900
I went to see Quelling.

100
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,085
He once had
an offer on the table

101
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,171
that would change his life,

102
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:49,505
and he turned it down

103
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,508
because he wanted to do
what was right for his clients.

104
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,844
Cost him everything.

105
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,462
The only thing
it didn't cost him

106
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:58,414
was his ability
to practice law.

107
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:00,016
And I didn't want
to take it away from him

108
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,083
just like I don't wanna
take it away from me.

109
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,135
Mike.

110
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,304
You said that staying
is eating me up,

111
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,191
but the thought of going
is eating me up more.

112
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,563
I'm just--I'm not ready
to leave, Rachel.

a few questions.

Who's "we"?

What can I help you with?

00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:37,837
We'd prefer to have
this conversation in private.

- Prefer?
- Insist.

Scottie.

123
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:56,856
I know we got in a fight,

124
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,026
but drinking before 10:00 a.m.,
is that really the answer?

125

about being open with you.

Donna, I don't wanna hear it.

140
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:53,663
I didn't tell her
about Mike.

00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,767
Well, not on your own anyway.

164
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,252
Is there a question?

165
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,420
Come on,
you're a bright young man.

166
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,422
You see where I'm going.

167
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:56,192
I don't want the dealer.

168
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,110
I want the supplier.

169
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,062
Harvey Specter.

170
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:04,817
Roll over on him,
I'll cut a deal right now.

181
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:46,620
Harvey Specter.
I represent Mike Ross.

182
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,954
Sir, you can't
go back there.

183
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,839
Sir!

184
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:56,713
Well, hey there.

185
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,965
Are you charging him?

186
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,767
- Not at the moment.
- Then he's coming with me.

187
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,352
And you had no right
to bring him in.

188
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,137
I had every right
to bring him in,

189
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:06,439
but it doesn't matter
'cause he came in voluntarily.

190
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:07,857
And he's leaving
immediately.

191
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,442
We were just having
a friendly conversation

192
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,894
about the witnesses
who suddenly fell out

193
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,863
of the Ava Hessington case.

194
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,732
Seems your associate
was a little chummy

195
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,951
with the associate
at Bratton Gould.

196
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,987
Harvey Gunderson,
I think, is his name.

197
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,657
Harold Gunderson.

198
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,709
You're right.

199
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,627
You're Harvey.

200
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,329
I gotta keep this
all straight in my head

201
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,830
before I make my case.

202
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:33,216
Because once
we bring Harold in,

203
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,801
he'll point
the finger at Mike,

204
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,386
who will then
have no choice

205
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,872
but to bring it right home
to you, Harvey.

206
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:42,726
I promise I won't forget
your name again.

207
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,312
Open that door.

208
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:52,235
Good talking to you, Mike.
Hope it's the first of many.

209
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,605
Jessica,
I have some dire news.

210
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,407
I was just walking
by the conference room,

211
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:59,659
and I saw Max Pollard
sitting there all by himself.

212
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:00,893
Harvey was a no-show?

213
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,162
Don't worry,
I took care of everything,

214
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:04,280
but it's not like Harvey
to miss a meeting.

215
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,915
Thank you, Louis.
I'll look into it.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,117
You see,
that's just it.

217
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,068
I think something
might be wrong with him.

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,954
You mean like he's a spy?

219
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,789
No, Jessica, listen.

220
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:14,574
Ever since my heart attack,

221
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,925
I've been worrying
about other people's health.

222
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,510
And I'd ask Donna,
but I don't wanna burden her

223
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:18,878
with the knowledge
of his mortality.

224
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,680
You don't think
Donna knows Harvey can die?

225
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:21,965
Look, Jessica, I know

226
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,250
Harvey appears to be lean
and relatively fit,

227
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,436
but coronary disease can strike
even the most handsome.

228
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,887
Louis, listen to me.

229
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,557
Harvey isn't sick.
He didn't have a heart attack.

230
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:31,808
And if he missed
that meeting,

231
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:35,195
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

232
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,312
I'm sure you're right.

233
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:37,447
I'm gonna go check
my blood pressure.

234
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,616
Oh, good idea.

235
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:49,292
Where the hell is Harvey?

236
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:50,794
Is he supposed to be
somewhere he's not?

237
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,380
Donna, no games.

238
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:55,248
He missed a meeting
with a longtime client,

239
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,751
so either you screwed up,
which you never do,

240
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:00,503
or there's an emergency
I'm not being told about.

241
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:01,554
Both.

242
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:03,506
Meaning?

243
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,958
I forgot
to cancel that meeting

244
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,644
because there's
an emergency.

245
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:07,594
What is it?

246
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:14,267
Mike Ross got called in
for questioning this morning.

247
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,822
Sorry about this, Harvey.

248
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:20,490
Could have been worse.

249
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:22,275
You thought they had me
for being a fraud?

250
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:23,493
Well, I didn't think
they had you

251
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,111
for overdue library books.

252
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:26,830
Why'd you go with them
in the first place?

253
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:28,164
Didn't your grandmother
ever teach you

254
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,699
not to get into cars
with strangers?

255
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:30,950
I was being cooperative.

256
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,036
Well, don't do that again.

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,587
Goddamn Quelling.

258
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:35,839
He didn't just
hand us to the bar.

259
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,507
He went
to the Justice Department.

260
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,875
I can't believe it.

261
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,710
I looked him in the eye.
He gave me his word.

262
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:43,379
Screw that guy.
I'm turning him into the bar.

263
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:45,348
Right now
he's not our problem.

264
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,800
Harold is.

265
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:47,934
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

266
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,636
Not a chance.

267
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:50,837
Harvey, they haven't
brought him in yet.

268
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:51,771
All I need
is five minutes to tell him--

269
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,172
To stick to your story?

270
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:55,442
That's exactly why they
haven't brought him in yet.

271
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:56,860
You talk to Harold,

272
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,177
they'll be watching,
we'll be done.

273
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,946
If we don't talk to him
before this Woodall guy

274
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,514
gets him in the room,
we're in deep shit.

275
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:04,567
Then we need to talk to him
without talking to him.

276
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:17,881
Allison Holt.

277
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,550
Harvey Specter.

278
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:23,169
Can't say I'm surprised
to see you.

279
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,371
So I assume that means you've
spoken to the U.S. Attorney.

280
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:26,506
I have.

281
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:27,557
Then I suggest
we make sure

282
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:28,758
we're on the same page.

283
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,677
Unlike you,
I don't automatically

284
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:33,480
protect someone who may have
jeopardized my firm.

285
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:36,015
What exactly did you say
when Woodall came to you?

286
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,101
He didn't come to me.
I went to him.

287
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,486
What?

288
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:41,070
A man named James Quelling
came at me,

289
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,490
questioning the settlement
between Harold Gunderson,

290
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,825
Mike Ross,
and your murder witnesses.

291
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,944
So you go straight
to the U.S. Attorney?

292
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,078
My integrity was questioned.

293
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:50,330
First step
isn't to go to the person

294
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:52,582
I'm accused of colluding with
to cover it up.

295
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,066
Answer me one thing--

296
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,919
does Harold Gunderson know
what's going on?

297
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,036
I don't know
what he knows,

298
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,255
and, frankly,
I don't care.

299
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,258
I fired Harold Gunderson
an hour ago.

300
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:11,134
Can I talk to you
for a second?

301
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:13,970
Of course.

302
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:20,426
I just got
taken downtown.

303
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,928
What?

304
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,697
The U.S. Attorney's office
brought me in for questioning.

305
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,818
I thought it was about me,
but it wasn't.

306
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:29,936
[Exhales]
Thank God.

307
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,204
No, Rachel,
it's still bad.

308
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:32,405
They're looking
into the settlement

309
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,490
that I made with Harold
before Ava's trial.

310
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,709
That deal
wasn't exactly legitimate.

311
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:40,296
And they want me
to turn on Harvey.

312
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:41,881
I knew you should have
taken that job.

313
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:42,966
This has nothing
to do with that.

314
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,967
Doesn't it?

315
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,468
If you weren't working here,

316
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,620
they wouldn't be able
to use your relationship

317
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:48,805
with Harvey as leverage.

318
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,056
You think
I would turn my back on him

319
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,724
even if I wasn't
working here?

320
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,292
I don't think you'd ever
turn your back on Harvey.

321
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:54,644
That's the problem.

322
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,180
- What does that mean?
- Harvey wanted you to stay.

323
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:59,148
I wanted you to leave.
You chose to stay.

324
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,651
So your priorities,
they seem pretty clear to me.

325
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:05,521
- Rachel, come on.
- Hey, wait a minute

326
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:06,806
if they charge you
with something,

327
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,024
they're gonna go
through your records,

328
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,492
and they are going
to realize

329
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:12,495
that you're not
a member of the bar.

330
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,532
No, they won't.

331
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,509
What are you talking about?

332
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:28,211
I had Lola Jensen
hack into the bar

333
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:31,681
and put me
in their records.

334
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:34,267
And when were
you going to tell me?

335
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,885
I was going to tell you
everything last night,

336
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,854
but you didn't exactly seem
like you were in the mood.

337
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:41,340
Oh, I'm not
in the mood right now either.

338
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:42,558
I am gonna go outside
and get some air.

339
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,110
Why don't you just stay here
and figure out

340
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,445
if there's some other crime
you can commit

341
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:48,698
to get out of this one?

342
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,587
You should have called me
the minute this went down.

343
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,805
There wasn't time.

344
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,407
You had time
to see Allison Holt.

345
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,075
I was trying to get
out in front of it.

346
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,227
Allison Holt
isn't our problem.

347
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,729
Mike Ross is.

348
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,063
The U.S. Attorney
keeps poking around,

349
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,682
he's gonna find out
that his star witness

350
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,234
isn't even in the bar.
No, he won't.

351
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,436
If they look in the bar,
they'll find Mike Ross

352
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,523
listed as a member.

353
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,775
You had him
commit another felony?

354
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,443
You want me
to say that out loud?

355
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,730
No, I don't.

356
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,498
I'd rather get back
to the matter at hand.

357
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,918
We need to make sure
Harold Gunderson doesn't talk.

358
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,202
Then you need
to learn more

359
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,837
about the man
who's trying to make him talk,

360
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,924
because he's coming for you,
and you don't know who he is,

361
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,375
what he'll do,
or what he's got.

362
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,676
I know one thing--

363
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,911
if he had
any kind of proof,

364
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,046
someone here would have
already been arrested.

365
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:45,082
Arrested?
For what?

366
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,768
We're being investigated
for the settlement

367
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,470
between us and Bratton Gould
in the Hessington case.

368
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,688
Quelling didn't go away?

369
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,273
Quelling threatened
to go to the bar.

370
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,143
This is
the U.S. Attorney's office.

371
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,229
Well, that only matters
if the allegations have merit.

372
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,099
I never thought
I would have to ask this,

373
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,235
but do the allegations
have merit?

374
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,436
We're handling this,
Scottie.

375
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,738
I didn't ask
who was handling it.

376
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:10,241
I asked
if they have merit.

377
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,882
Scottie.
Scottie.

378
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,116
What, are you
gonna be charming?

379
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,885
Quote a TV show?

380
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,286
What happened to
"I'm going to do better"?

381
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,222
God damn it,
I'm trying.

382
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,591
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what trying means.

383
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,509
You know what, Scottie?
You keep on thinking

384
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,178
that there are things
being withheld from you, but--

385
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,513
But what?
It's just business?

386
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,016
- It is just business.
- Fine.

387
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,068
As a senior partner,
I want to know

388
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,187
if this firm outright
broke any laws.

389
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,905
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Donna.

390
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,907
If you want me
to talk to Stephanie,

391
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,642
you have to tell me what you
want me to ask her right now.

392
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,444
[Sighs]

393
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,447
I guess it's
"not now, Scottie."

394
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,086
Mike. Mike.
I need to talk to you.

395
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,371
No, no, I can't
even be seen with you.

396
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,956
Go, now.
But you have to talk to me.

397
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,991
Allison Holt
just fired me out of the blue.

398
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,659
I'm freaking out, man.
Harold, listen to me.

399
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,844
You have to calm down,
all right?

400
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,495
Harold Gunderson,
you're not welcome here.

401
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,964
You know what, Louis?

402
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,298
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now, so--

403
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,434
Well, I don't give a shit.
Mike, do me a favor.

404
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,104
Do not let this unappreciative
ex-employee into our offices.

405
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,773
Harold, you have to go,
right now.

406
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,809
No, wait, Mike.
Please.

407
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,727
I got a call
from the U.S. Attorney's office

408
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,446
asking for me to come in.

409
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,864
Somehow,
they're onto what we did,

410
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,865
and I think we need to--
Harold, Harold, Harold.

411
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,483
Harold.

412
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,285
All I know
about that settlement

413
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,121
is that you stuck it to us
because you saw the chance

414
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,456
to get back at us
for firing you.

415
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,540
Mike, that's not true.

416
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,575
I don't want
to hear it, Harold.

417
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,244
What you did
was harsh and vindictive,

418
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,714
but it was completely legal
because you initiated it.

419
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,582
And nobody can prove
anything other than that

420
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,335
as long as we both
remember it.

421
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,507
- I lost my job, Mike.
- I'm sorry about that, Harold.

422
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:52,310
I wish there was something
I could do.

423
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:53,811
Now I have to go back inside.

424
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,813
Michael Ross,
Harold Gunderson,

425
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,015
you're under arrest
for conspiracy

426
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,551
to defraud
the United States government.

427
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,582
Hey.
Thanks for meeting with me.

428
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,417
Donna, you can thank me
all you want.

429
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,202
I don't know anything
about Eric Woodall.

430
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,403
Stephanie, come on.

431
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,122
You know everything that goes on
in that office.

432
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,458
You just don't want
to tell me.

433
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,959
What do you want
to know?

434
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,211
Well, how about we start with
why he's coming after Harvey?

435
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,430
Because he hates
dirty lawyers.

436
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,182
He thinks
they're the scum of the earth.

437
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,767
And Harvey got
on his radar?

438
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,136
And the reason
Woodall's not on your radar

439
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,439
is because the last case he won
took him four years.

440
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,475
So you're saying
he'll stop at nothing?

441
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,226
Not that I've ever seen.

442
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,528
Then we need
to know what he's got.

443
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,896
No way.

444
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,764
I called you
when they brought your guy in.

445
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,649
I could lose my job
for that as it is.

446
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,602
You have something else a lot
more important than your job,

447
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,404
thanks to me.

448
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,373
When are you gonna stop
holding that over my head?

449
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,709
In another 30 seconds if you
tell me what I need to know.

450
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,113
Okay.

451
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,998
He's got nothing.

452
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,918
But the thing is,
he wins with nothing.

453
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,253
You just said
he hates dirty lawyers,

454
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,223
and now you're saying
he'll break the law?

455
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,625
He may, he may not.

456
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,762
But he'll definitely
bend the shit out of it.

457
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,798
I want to know
what's going on.

458
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,016
I told you
what's going on.

459
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,985
Harvey and I are taking care
of a situation.

460
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,988
That's a bullshit answer,
and you know it.

461
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't know how it went
with you and Edward Darby,

462
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,275
but you come into my office
with that attitude,

463
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,494
and it won't go well
for you with me.

464
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,645
My attitude comes
from the fact

465
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,746
that I worked
for Edward Darby.

466
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,115
I don't want to work
for another one.

467
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,450
You're way out of line.

468
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,752
Your name is not
on the door here.

469
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,204
No, but if this all comes down
because of something

470
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,672
you and Harvey did,
I'm tainted by it.

471
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,843
Then walk away, Scottie.
I'm not stopping you.

472
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,845
No, the noncompete
you had me sign is stopping me.

473
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,131
Is that
what's stopping you?

474
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,383
Jessica, I moved my life
back to New York.

475
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,051
I don't want
to move again.

476
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,387
So I'm asking you
one more time--

477
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,023
what is going on?

478
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,280
What's going on,

479
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,032
is you and Harvey
made an impulsive deal

480
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,650
for you to come here,

481
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:13,901
and clearly,
it's not working out,

482
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,536
or you'd be having
this conversation

483
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,022
with him and not me.

484
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,662
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

485
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,164
I've been in here
for two hours.

486
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,364
You said I was under arrest,

487
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,202
but I still haven't
been processed.

488
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,037
I demand to call Harvey.

489
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,090
Sorry, we can't have that.

490
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,092
Then I guess you can't have
a guilty verdict against me

491
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,428
or anybody else,
because I know my rights.

492
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,480
Well, I'm afraid
your rights have run

493
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,483
smack into a little something
called the Patriot Act.

494
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,734
Whatever bullshit
you're trying to pull

495
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,519
only applies to terrorists.

496
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,071
Then it's a good thing
there are allegations

497
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,191
of terrorism against
those Hessington witnesses.

498
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,529
[Sighs]

499
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,915
You're not gonna
get away with this.

500
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,201
I'm not getting away
with anything.

501
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,038
I'm just being thorough by
looking into these allegations.

502
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,256
Try to be patient.

503
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,707
Maybe, uh,
think about the fact

504
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,260
that Harold Gunderson
is trying to be patient

505
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,129
right next door.

506
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:30,740
Pacing.
Right on schedule.

507
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,742
First sign that a man
is losing it.

508
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,494
It's called walking.

509
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,745
You can call it
what you want.

510
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:36,913
I know what I'm looking at.

511
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:38,915
Yeah.
So do I.

512
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:41,066
A guy who looked
into those terrorist allegations

513
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,785
and came up with nothing.

514
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,921
I'll admit the rumors
about those witnesses

515
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:47,373
were unsubstantiated.

516
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,258
But I'd be negligent
if I didn't look

517
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:53,412
into an American with ties
to such questionable characters.

518
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,765
And you never know
what a thorough background check

519
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:59,802
is gonna turn up.

520
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:01,220
Then go ahead.

521
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,922
Do your background check,
so I can get out of here,

522
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,975
because all this is doing
is making me bored.

523
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,227
Well, I can take care
of that for you.

524
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:11,230
Why don't I let you watch
a little TV?

525
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,824
Now, that's pacing.

526
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,718
Did you find out anything
useful on Eric Woodall?

527
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:35,588
I found out we need
to start going on offense.

528
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,256
How?

529
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:38,925
Donna's having Mike compile
every piece of communication

530
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,309
during that settlement
to prove

531
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:42,762
Harold contacted us first,
not the other way around.

532
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:45,431
- Is that true?
- You really want to know?

533
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,016
After that,
we're gonna read up

534
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,769
on every tactic Woodall used
in his last case.

535
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,770
Case?

536
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:52,855
Took him four years.

537
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,440
Dog with a bone.

538
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,442
That's why we're going
on offense.

539
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:59,362
Well, I found out
something too.

540
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,831
Scottie wants to leave.

541
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,199
What?

542
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:06,485
She asked out
of her noncompete.

543
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:07,920
And what did you say?

544
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:10,206
I said I had to discuss it
with my partner.

545
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,959
It would have been nice if she
discussed it with her partner.

546
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,762
She accused me
of some pretty shady shit.

547
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,297
And she's right.

548
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:20,349
What are you talking about?

549
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:23,302
I told you earlier,

550
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:26,305
I didn't want
to know about Mike and the bar,

551
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:27,807
and just now, you asked me
if I wanted to know

552
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:29,859
about Mike and Harold,
and again,

553
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:32,395
I didn't want to know.

554
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:36,198
And "I don't want to know" is
exactly what Edward Darby said.

555
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:39,702
We're not him.

556
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:41,821
Edward Darby didn't
commit those murders.

557
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,322
He just covered them up.

558
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,358
And it seems to me
we keep doing things,

559
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,862
and then we have to keep
covering them up.

560
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:52,498
We're not him.

561
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:53,749
Harvey.

562
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:58,004
What do you want me
to tell Scottie?

563
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,505
If she doesn't want
to be here,

564
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:01,874
let her go.

565
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:08,047
[Elevator dings]

566
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,649
What the hell
did you do?

567
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:10,766
You know what I did.

568
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,018
I handed you in
to the bar.

569
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:13,603
Mike Ross and I
had a deal.

570
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,888
Yeah, well, that deal
went away when he got brought in

571
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:18,074
for questioning
by the U.S. Attorney.

572
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,659
What?
That wasn't me.

573
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,027
I didn't go to them.

574
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,394
I don't give a shit
if you went to them or not.

575
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:24,330
This whole thing started
when you walked into my office

576
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:26,582
with a lawsuit
you were bribed to create.

577
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,417
And after that,
I made a deal with Mike.

578
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:29,835
And I held
to my end of the bargain.

579
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:31,287
Maybe you didn't hear me.

580
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,172
That deal went away
when they picked him up,

581
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,124
hauled him in,
and then tried to get him

582
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,509
to turn on me.

583
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,627
Well, you can still
stop this.

Yeah, well,
I'm not going to.

Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

589

You pulled out a gun
and threatened to shoot my guy,

but I need him to give me--
He was talking to Harold?

No, it's nothing.
I have to go talk to Harvey.

Whoa, wait a second.
Harvey?

611
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,695
Does this have something to do
with why he missed his meeting

00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,867
It had everything
to do with it.

632
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,452
You mean you were
trying to cover your tracks.

633
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,571
No, we were having
a heated conversation

634
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,073
about what bullshit charges
these are.

635
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,542
Okay, I'm done
playing your games.

636
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:36,361
He was your only friend
at that firm, you got fired.

637
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:37,880
You got him another job,

638
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:40,549
and that's why you went to him
to set this whole thing up.

639
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:42,001
You've got
your information wrong.

640
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,552
He wasn't my friend.

641
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:44,970
I had the chance
to save his job...

642
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,306
But instead,
he threw me under the bus.

643
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:49,508
That is why I instituted
this lawsuit.

644
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,544
So you can take your bullshit
allegations somewhere else

645
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:54,396
because I am not
gonna roll on Harvey.

646
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:55,981
I'm not rolling on Mike.

647
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:00,269
And Harold is not
gonna roll on me.

648
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:03,572
You guys
are well rehearsed.

649
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:05,107
So I'll ask you again,

650
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,943
is that what you were doing
on the street today?

651
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,198
[Sighs]

652
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:13,616
Jesus Christ, you know,
you drive like my Nana--

653
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,284
he drives like my Nana,
and she's 102.

654
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,869
Relax, Louis.
Ray's on it.

655
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,038
Nobody's
getting us there faster.

656
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,372
I mean, I can't believe
this whole thing's been going on

657
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:21,624
and I've been
completely out of the loop.

658
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,958
Louis, I don't want
to rehash it.

659
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:24,293
Right now,
Mike's in custody.

660
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:25,628
We need to get him out.

661
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:28,464
Yeah, and you need to tell me
what the hell happened.

662
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:29,748
Are you asking
if we broke the law

663
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,717
when we made
that settlement with Harold?

664
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:35,688
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

665
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,690
We have exposure.

666
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:42,478
Well, then you better hope
that Ray drives

667
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:45,197
a little goddamn faster,
because you and I both know

668
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,199
what's going on in there.

669
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:53,207
Let me tell what
we're dealing with here.

670
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:59,272
Conspiring to bribe witnesses--
seven years.

671
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:02,492
You filed a sworn declaration
in support of your suit.

672
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:05,278
That's perjury--
another two years.

673
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:06,613
And to top it all off,

674
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:08,281
the money was
transferred overseas,

675
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:11,000
which would be--

676
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:15,288
well, you're a lawyer.
Fill in the blank.

677
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:17,207
- Wire fraud.
- Bingo.

678
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,827
Big winner.
And your prize is 20 more years.

679
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:24,214
And here's the thing.
I am gonna make sure

680
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,965
that it's not
a cushy white-collar prison.

681
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,133
[Car horn honking]

682
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:29,168
This is just ridiculous.

683
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,337
If Harold isn't broken by now,
I'll shit my pants.

684
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,056
If Harold's broken,
then when we get there,

685
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,043
Mike's gonna be
on his way to prison.

686
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,779
Someone needs to get in there
and hold his hand.

687
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,564
Not someone...

688
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,950
You.
Are you serious?

689
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:45,201
I'm the last person
in the world

690
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:48,020
that Harold Gunderson
wants to see right now.

691
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,156
Louis,
when we were associates,

692
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,791
who did you fear most?

693
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:54,127
That's easy.
My mother.

694
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,664
I meant in the firm.

695
00:27:57,715 --> 00:27:59,198
Daniel Hardman.

696
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,216
So who would you most
want to come in

697
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,051
and take on Eric Woodall,

698
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:05,054
if you were in that room?

699
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,723
- Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

700
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,424
Look, Harold may not like you,

701
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,894
but he respects you,
and he's all alone.

702
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:12,178
Now, when we get there,

703
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,180
I need you to channel
your inner Hardman,

704
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:15,431
get him to trust you,

705
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:19,051
and then shut him
the hell up.

706
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:27,393
Can I talk to you
for a second?

707
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,661
You look concerned.

708
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,114
[Sighs]

709
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,736
Do you know why I never batted
an eye when I found out

710
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:39,005
Harvey had hired a kid
who didn't go to law school?

711
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:41,708
Because you're loyal to him.

712
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,427
Because I knew
what was inside him.

713
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:46,179
And I thought if he had
a protege--

714
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,882
He could have hired
a protege from Harvard.

715
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:52,018
But he wouldn't have been
forced to protect him.

716
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:55,355
And he wouldn't have become
the man he is today.

717
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:59,392
Well, now that protege is
in trouble.

718
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:00,810
[Sighs]

719
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:03,813
They have Mike
and Harold Gunderson in custody.

720
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,099
Then Harvey's
in trouble too.

721
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,101
No.

722
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:10,937
Mike would never
turn on Harvey.

723
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,956
You never know
what might happen to a person

724
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,742
once they get
in that room.

725
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:19,712
Not now, Scottie.

726
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,113
Donna, I'm just writing him

727
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:24,334
a note telling him
I wanted to talk.

728
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,336
[Scoffs]
"To talk."

729
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:30,924
I don't think you know how hard
he's trying.

730
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:33,292
I know he's trying.

731
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:35,127
I'm just not sure
that it's good enough.

732
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:36,562
You knew
who he was, Scottie.

733
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,015
- And I thought he would change.
- I think he has changed,

734
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,016
and if it's not enough
for you, then--

735
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,234
That's not the problem.

736
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:42,819
I think that he's changed
too much,

737
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:46,356
and I think it happened
before I got back.

738
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,074
He's a good man, Scottie,

739
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:51,494
but he's not perfect.

740
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:53,613
Sometimes you just have to take
what you get,

741
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,915
or walk away.

742
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,377
You know, they did
an experiment a few years back.

743
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:09,712
Took five mice,
put 'em in a cage,

744
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:13,967
fed them just enough to survive,
and you know what happened?

745
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:17,169
One by one,
they cornered the weakest mouse

746
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:20,523
and ate him alive.

747
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:23,476
You know what you're gonna be
when you get to prison, Mike?

748
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:25,812
The weakest mouse.
Bullshit.

749
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:27,847
They have done studies,
and I've read them,

750
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,115
and that's not what happens.

751
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:31,651
The only way a mouse
eats one of his own

752
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:34,203
is if he's been contaminated
by another species.

Yeah, you're right.

but I'm not letting him go,

Not so fast.

I demand to see my client,

and my client isn't Mike Ross,
it's Harold Gunderson.

00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,918
- And you are?
- Louis Litt, Pearson Specter.

769
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:42,421
You're telling me that a man
who works at the law firm

he's accused of colluding with
just happens to be his attorney?

That's exactly
what I'm saying.

772
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,928
- Bullshit.
- No.

773
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:50,646
What's bullshit is you thinking
it's up to you

who gets to represent
Harold Gunderson.

775

So if I walk in there
right now

776
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:56,369
and ask him who his attorney is,
he's gonna say it's you?

777
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:57,770
Doesn't matter
what he says.

778
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,740
It's 4:07, and if
you don't let me see my client,

779
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,376
anything he says after this
second will be inadmissible.

- Then why am I still in here?

Because we're waiting

Louis?
To do what?

Louis is in with Harold?

Harold hates Louis!

I'm in the seventh circle
of hell.

Well, the cavalry
has arrived.

801
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,388
I don't need the cavalry.
I've decided to get out.

Okay, Harold,
you cannot sign a deal.

You'll never work
as a lawyer again.

You fired me as a lawyer.

to walk out of here today,

Rachel, if this thing
moves forward to trial,

I will do everything
in my power to win.

827

But there's two minutes left
in the game,

828

and our star players
are on the field.

829
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,926

we just have to have faith.

We're going to be family.

834

family is by being with them

It's about the time I decided
to tell my dad about my mom.

You remember what I told you
about her?

847

- Harvey--
- I was 20,

848
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,980
out of the house,

849
00:35:11,064 --> 00:35:12,631
and I told her
I would never tell him

850
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:15,634
as long as she never
brought anyone--

851
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:23,309
I came home to do laundry
one day, and I heard--

I heard,

853
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:32,618
and then I saw,
and I told him that night.

854
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,509
Because sometimes
it's better to tell.

This whole thing
was my idea.

It's me Woodall wants.

then with Lola Jensen,

and to top it all off,

00:36:15,045 --> 00:36:17,463
we suborned perjury
with Edward Darby.

00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,555
Thank you.

946
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,258
You and Louis
really came through.

947
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,728
So did you.

948
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,348
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

949
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,233
- No, you don't.
- You don't want to go to jail.

Harvey...

951
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,692
I sat in that room today
and listened to you tell me

952
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,744
that ever since the day
we met,

953
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,912
you've had to cross one line

954
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,914
after another, and--
Mike-

955
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,417
No, just...
Let me finish.

956
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,671
First there was
Clifford Danner,

957
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,673
then the witnesses,

958
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,376
then suborning perjury,
not to mention the 17 things

959
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:21,431
we did to stop the merger
in the first place.

960
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,099
All of it,
since you hired me.

961
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,802
Look, that's not
what I said.

962
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,170
Yes, it is.

963
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:29,339
[Sighs] I wasn't blaming you
for those things.

964
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,341
It doesn't matter.

965
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,063
I'm tired of putting the people
I care about in jeopardy.

I took the job.

00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:52,529
We just got out.

Thanks.

977
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,592
Hey, when's your last day?

978
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,243
I don't know.
Why?

979
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:41,795
Well, I want to take you out
to dinner, you know?

I'm not gonna see you anymore.

I don't think you realize,
but I'm not exactly leaving.

Sidwell.
You're a client.

983
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,424
Which means technically,
you work for me now.

No, I don't.

- Don't even try it.
- Or "sir."

Whichever feels
least comfortable.

988
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,983
You know,
since I'm working alone now,

989
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,951
I guess
that makes me Superman.

990
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,038
Or Aquaman, seeing
as you're in over your head.
