1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,309
<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,679
Tara Messer,
will you marry me?

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,879
Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,679
I don't care
how much money you make

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,540
or how many you women
you sleep with.

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,449
You have issues in your life

7
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,680
that are going to keep you
from having real relationships.

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,229
Benjamin and I have an overlap
on our software

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,880
with another company.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,190
Louis pulled out every trick
in the book to get us this.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,465
- Take the money.
- I don't want the money.

12
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,329
- Donna--
- I want something more.

13
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,690
- What do you mean more?
<i>- I made a deal</i>

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,499
that we would handle
the miners' case

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,330
in exchange for the chance
to be admitted to the bar.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,139
Are you goddamn kidding me?
You're fired.

17
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,139
- Don't do it.
- He lied--not once, not twice--

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,570
I don't care
because we need him.

19
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,419
Monday morning, you better
start putting your money

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,610
where your mouth is and find us
another $50,000 case.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,679
Tara left
a 15-second voicemail.

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,710
She's either gonna tell me that
she never wants to see me again

23
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,319
or she wants to make up.

24
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,489
What's that?

25
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,189
Your first year's salary
in advance.

26
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,920
Welcome back.
Harvey, I'm running out

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,729
of ways to tell you I don't want
to be a corporate lawyer.

28
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,629
I'm offering you a deal.
One for you, one for me.

29
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,360
I don't wanna just fund
the clinic for a year.

30
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,709
I want to fund it for two,
and any case I want

31
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,700
to bring the clinic onto, I can.
Done.

32
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,939
- And there's one more thing.
- You are not getting my office.

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,739
Oh, yes, I am,
and I will tell you why.

34
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,640
- Why?
- 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.

35
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,520
It's time for you
to take the reins.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,449
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

37
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,480
Nothing, I was just
driving this baby around

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,389
and remembered
how much street parking you had.

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,389
Is that supposed
to impress me?

40
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,759
Well, I hope so.
Sure as hell impresses me.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,290
Well, it's nice to see you,
but if you wanted

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,669
an appointment,
you should have called.

43
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,969
I'm not here
for an appointment.

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,739
I'm here to ask you out.

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,539
You're serious.

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,239
I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately, and...

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,770
- Harvey...
- Please, let me finish.

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,579
Things have changed
since the last time I saw you.

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,249
I'm not the same man that I was.

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,779
I made peace with my family;

51
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,540
I got my old associate back,

52
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,619
and as of this morning,
I'm the head of my firm,

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,619
and when I thought
of sharing that with someone,

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,719
I thought of you.

55
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,450
Well, it doesn't matter,

56
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,595
because it's completely
unethical for a doctor

57
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,490
to engage in a relationship
with her patient.

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,335
Not if enough time has passed,
and according to the APA,

59
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,760
as of three weeks ago,
enough time has passed.

60
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,639
- You did your homework.
- Sure did.

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,039
So the only question is:

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,810
Thursday at 8:00
or Saturday at 9:00?

63
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,640
One dinner,
and if this chemistry you

64
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,379
so clearly think exists doesn't,

65
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,679
then we part as friends,
no hard feelings.

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,340
If it doesn't work out,

67
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,410
no harm, no foul.

68
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,759
Thursday.

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,489
Oh, and if the car's too much,

70
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,590
I can always have Ray drive.

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,435
I like the car.

72
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,460
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you.

73
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,499
I like the car.

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,549
Good.
You're here early.

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,750
I need you to take point
on a consumer fraud hearing

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,829
for Sandra.
Nathan, I need to talk to you.

77
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,689
Okay.

78
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,559
I know things got heated
between us the other night,

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,390
but as far as I'm concerned,
it's water under the bridge,

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,639
so if you're wondering
if I'm still upset at you--

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,460
I'm not.

82
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,539
And this is to make sure
you're still not upset with me

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,610
after you hear
what I'm about to say.

84
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,085
Why am I holding a check
for $500,000?

85
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,810
Because I've decided to go
back to Pearson Specter Litt,

86
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,419
and I gave you my word that I
wouldn't leave you high and dry.

87
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,350
So let me get this straight:
You changed your mind,

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,359
and now Harvey Specter
is buying you back?

89
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,429
If it were up to Harvey,
you wouldn't be getting a penny.

90
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,899
I insisted on this.

91
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,429
Just like I insisted
on every other case I take

92
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,730
from now on being pro Bono.
It sounds like you insisted

93
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,869
on that
to make yourself feel better.

94
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,599
No, Nathan, I did that

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,370
because I care about
doing this kind of work,

96
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,479
and if you're okay with it,
I'd even like the idea

97
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,119
of us partnering
on a case every now and then.

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,479
But what if I say I'm not okay
with any of this?

99
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,710
I know that you were the one
that gave me another chance

100
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,555
to be a lawyer
when no one else would,

101
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:41,410
but don't punish the clinic.

102
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,780
It's a lot of money.
With that, you could replace me

103
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,589
and help a lot of people
for a long time.

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,669
- Is that for me?
- No, actually, it's for me.

105
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,669
You're later than usually
this morning.

106
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,769
I've been waiting for you.
Donna, about the other night.

107
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,500
I know you said you wanted more,
but before you say anything--

108
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,770
- I want to be a partner.
- Partner?

109
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,449
Yes.
I figured out what I want,

110
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,789
and I want to be a partner
at this firm.

111
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,579
Donna, I don't mean
to insult you,

112
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,410
but you're not even a lawyer.

113
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,619
Good, because my being
a partner isn't about the law.

114
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,419
It's about keeping
this firm running,

115
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,180
which I've been doing
for as long as I can remember.

116
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,889
I know that, but it doesn't
mean that I can get you--

117
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,759
I've given over ten years of
my life to this place, Harvey,

118
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,890
and I've done it all
from your desk.

119
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,760
All I'm asking is
for a seat at the table.

120
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,200
I'll have to ask Louis
about it.

121
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,875
Does that mean that
you're on board?

122
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,839
I don't know.
It's Mike's first day back,

123
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,870
it's a big ask,
and on top of all of that,

124
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,779
I've decided to tell Louis

125
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,679
that I'm taking full control
as managing partner.

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,179
Well, congratulations, Harvey,
but which is it?

127
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,910
Louis?
Mike?

128
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,789
"Big ask."
Because I'd hate to think

129
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,759
I mustered the courage
to do this,

130
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,889
and then once you get on that
elevator, it's out of your mind.

131
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,520
I give you my word.
I will not forget about it.

132
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,799

Did you sleep in here?

145
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,540
Just getting a feel
for my new office.

146
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,219
You think a bike rack
would fit on this wall?

147
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,810
You put a bike rack in here,
your first pro Bono,

148
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,555
you'll be representing yourself
after I shove it up your ass.

149
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:55,819
Wow.
That sounds uncomfortable.

150
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,819
Now, speaking of pro bonos,

151
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,250
when are you gonna get your
old man records out of here

152
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,150
so I can settle in
and get to work?

153
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
I'll get out of here
once we take of Neil Stillman.

154
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,190
Neil Stillman?
Detour industries?

155
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,239
No, Neil Stillman,
Jedi counsel.

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,239
Okay, I was asking because

157
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,939
Neil Stillman is
a corporate client,

158
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,239
so what happened to one for me,
then one for you?

159
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,670
Do I need to remind you that
at a corporate law firm,

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,749
we do the cases
that pay the bills first?

161
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,919
Besides, I haven't even told you
the best part yet.

162
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,649
You only got
two weeks to live?

163
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,849
No.
After we're done with this case,

164
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,780
I'm giving you Neil Stillman.

165
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,719
Harvey, I appreciate that,
but seriously,

166
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,289
if you're just gonna give him
to me when we're done,

167
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,889
why don't you give him
to me now?

168
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,859
Whatever it is,
I can handle it myself.

169
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,859
- I know that.
- Then what's going on?

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,960
It doesn't make sense for us
to be working together on this.

171
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,739
All right, you want the truth?

172
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,260
When Jessica
made managing partner,

173
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,730
she and I never really got
to do cases together anymore.

174
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,300
You used to work
on cases together?

175
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,749
Yeah.
She was me and I was you.

176
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,770
We kicked ass.
Right.

177
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,779
And what exactly did
you contribute to the equation?

178
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,640
Oh, movie quotes, mostly,
but that's not the point.

179
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,949
The point is we had
a great time doing it.

180
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,750
- Harvey...
- Mike, I'm serious.

181
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,859
Once Jessica stepped up,
our relationship changed.

182
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,729
And if you'd known
that was gonna happen,

183
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,169
you would have wanted one
last case together.

184
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,629
Exactly.
So what do you say?

185
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,330
We go out and have some fun
and kick some ass?

186
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,909
Or do you want to stay here
measuring for your bike rack?

187
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,600
It's not gonna measure itself.

188
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,779
All right, fine.
Kick ass.

189
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,719
But we do this,
I want on that Jedi counsel.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,379
Robes, light saber,
whole deal.

191
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,910
Good, you're here.

192
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,750
Gretchen,
what are you doing here?

193
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,329
- I'm here to give you these.
- What are those?

194
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,620
Brochures from the top
nine mud resorts

195
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,259
in the northern hemisphere,
though I don't know

196
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,920
why a person would do
that in the first place.

197
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,329
It's like sitting in a bathtub
of your own poop.

198
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,030
What the hell
are you talking about?

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,809
Louis, you need
to take yourself some time off.

200
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,900
When's the last time
you even had a vacation?

201
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,739
Nine years ago July.

202
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,270
Goddamn travel agent sold me
a package

203
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,679
to Club Med Bangladesh,
so, hard pass.

204
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,719
What kind of person goes
to a sex club in Bangladesh?

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
It's not like that.

206
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,789
I had just seen
"Slumdog Millionaire,"

207
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,710
and I was trying
to find Freida Pinto.

208
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,419
I believe she considers London
her place of habitat.

209
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,880
No, I'm not talking about
the real Freida Pinto.

210
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,819
I'm talking about
my Freida Pinto.

211
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,389
There's many different
Freida Pintos out there, okay?

212
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,959
So just--I'm not an idiot.
Leave me alone.

213
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,060
Louis, I'm just worried that
if you sit around and stew,

214
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,999
this breakup's gonna
get the best of you.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,660
Gretchen, I really
appreciate that,

216
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,939
but I'm not just
gonna sit around.

217
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,039
I'm gonna be pouring
my heartbreak

218
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,439
into those new associates.

219
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,979
Are you sure that's
the best idea?

220
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,439
Look...

221
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,040
I didn't just lose Tara.

222
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,679
I lost a chance
at being a father.

223
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,280
And those associates have
always been my children to me.

224
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,949
My children.

225
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,750
And the truth is,
I've been neglecting them

226
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,429
ever since they got here,

227
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,329
but that ends this morning.

228
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,729
I'm proud of you, Louis.

229
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,860
Thank you, Gretchen.

230
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,079
- Where the hell have you been?
- Neil, you called an hour ago.

231
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,049
Well, that means you should
have been here in 30 minutes.

232
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,109
Well, I got news for you:
I'm not Dominos.

233
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,010
That's too bad,
because slinging pizzas

234
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,419
might be the only job
you can get

235
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,919
if you don't stop
shitting the bed.

236
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,819
Shitting the bed?
How's that?

237
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,750
I've been trying to get you
on the phone for two weeks.

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,330
Jessica leaves, and all of
a sudden, I start falling

239
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,820
through the cracks?
You're not falling

240
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,729
through anything.
I'm here now,

241
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,429
and I brought the best
junior partner in the firm.

242
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,399
I don't give a shit if he's
the best junior towel boy.

243
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,069
I got something for you to do,
and I want it done yesterday.

244
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,339
Let me guess, you want to sell
your vodka business.

245
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,139
How the hell could
you know that?

246
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,139
Because you don't clean up
the balance sheet

247
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,300
of your third largest division
six months after you restructure

248
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,879
if you're not looking
to put it on the market.

249
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,409
Okay, you brought
the right guy.

250
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,340
My question is,
what took so long?

251
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,049
And my question is
what's the rush?

252
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,149
'Cause you also don't ram
a transaction through

253
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,910
if you don't have to.
I have an opportunity

254
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,319
to buy another company,
and I don't wanna

255
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,019
let it slip away.
What company?

256
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
I'll start vetting them for you.
They're Russian,

257
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,329
and they make
a little product called

258
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,099
none of your goddamn business.

259
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,359
Neil, what's with the secrecy?
We're your lawyers.

260
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,060
We need to know
what you're looking to do.

261
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,969
The secrecy is
in case you're not my lawyers

262
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,469
two weeks from now.

263
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,009
I don't want you knowing
who I'm going after.

264
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,330
Is that a threat?

265
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,939
It's just my way
of making sure

266
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,339
I don't keep falling
through the cracks.

267
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,940
Now let's talk terms.

268
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,189
Good morning, Gretchen.
Have you seen Louis?

269
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,829
I'm worried about
how he's doing after last night.

270
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,929
My guess is he's in
the bullpen

271
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,029
with his hatchlings.
His hatchlings?

272
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,029
I was concerned about him
as you were,

273
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,129
so I tried
to get him to take a vacation.

274
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,399
He said he'd rather focus
on raising those associates.

275
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,530
Focus on them or take it
out on them?

276
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,939
Knowing him, probably 50/50,

277
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,570
but the man turned down a trip

278
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,509
to the finest mud resorts
in the world,

279
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,140
so I decided to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

280
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,590
Then I will too.

281
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,859
Good morning, boys and girls.

282
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,577
Who's ready to tear
Watson Industries a new asshole?

283
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,529
That's what I like to see.
Now, on your desks,

284
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,399
I've made each of you a copy
of my initial brief.

285
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,199
Cling to it
as if you wrote it yourself,

286
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,130
and if any of you need
to go to the bathroom,

287
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,009
I suggest you do it now,
because for the next two weeks,

288
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,879
we are not leaving this room.

289
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,079
No one will be shitting.
No one will be pissing.

290
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,540
No--
Go ahead, ask him.

291
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,849
Ask me what?

292
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,250
I heard about
your reputation, but...

293
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,019
But what?

294
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,850
Don't you worry about
my reputation, son.

295
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,489
I am not the same Louis
I used to be.

296
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,420
I still may be tough,
but I have a soft spot,

297
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,090
so what do you need?

298
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,199
Two days off.

299
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,930
No problem.

300
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,209
Feel free to take
Saturday and Sunday off.

301
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,030
He meant in addition
to the weekend.

302
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,939
In addition?
Brian, is this true?

303
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,570
- Yes.
- Then...

304
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,879
Monday and Sunday
you shall have.

305
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,455
Okay, fine.
Monday and Tuesday it is.

306
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:02,080
- Thank you, Mr. Litt.
- No, no, just call me Louis.

307
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,489
Mind if I ask
what the occasion is?

308
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,189
- I'm gonna be a father.
- What?

309
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,220
We're gonna have a baby boy.

310
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,199
Something everybody here knows
is never gonna happen to you.

311
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,009
Gonna be a father

312
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,180
for the rest of his life.

313
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,019
- What'd you just say to me?
- I said it's a C-section,

314
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,489
'cause the baby's
actually sideways,

315
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,019
which means we have
to go in there...

316
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,650
You self-centered
piece of shit.

317
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,159
Do you think I care
about the graphic details?

318
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,029
- I just thought--
- Thought what?

319
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,095
That you don't give a shit
about your job?

320
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:45,220
Let me tell you something: When
you work here, you work here.

321
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,590
You don't think about home
and families and babies.

322
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,660
So the next time you want
to put your personal life

323
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,530
ahead of the needs of this firm,

324
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,109
you better goddamn come to me

325
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,179
a year in advance.
That's not fair.

326
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,650
He couldn't have known he was
gonna have a baby a year--

327
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,140
Let me tell you something,
Stephanie:

328
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,149
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made,

329
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,049
because when people are trying,
they know they're trying,

330
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,649
and just because no one
ever wants to try with you

331
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,210
doesn't give you the right

332
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,359
to tell me
how to run my associates.

333
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,980
You got that?

334
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,520
Got it.

335
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,860
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

336
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,469
Depends.
What are you thinking?

337
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,230
I'm thinking we've got
a vodka company to sell.

338
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,900
You already said you wanted
to have some fun.

339
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,249
That's right,
and you put those two together,

340
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,870
what have we got?

341
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,309
Party.
See?

342
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,840
We're already on the same page.

343
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,519
Why don't you get
a kick-ass location,

344
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,349
and I'll get the models.
Models?

345
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,549
I like models.
Why can't I get the models?

346
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,519
You make a good point.

347
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,419
It's a two-man job.
We'll both get the models.

348
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,920
Harvey, seriously,
why do we even have

349
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,499
to have models at this party?

350
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,359
Well, two reasons.
First, people expect it,

351
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
and you've got to give the
people what they want.

352
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,829
Right, and second,

353
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,860
any dipshit who shows up
and hits on the models all night

354
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,869
isn't a serious bidder
for the company.

355
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,570
Huh, you really are ready
for my office.

356
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,479
Hey, speaking of which, when
exactly is that gonna happen.

357
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,315
I can't talk about that
right now.

358
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:07,909
I got to go hit on some models.
Hey, Harvey,

359
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,910
jokes aside,
what you said before

360
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,389
about us working together
like the old days,

361
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,449
I appreciate it.

362
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,319
It means a lot to me.

363
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,420
Me too.

364
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,929
Pussy.

365
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,299
Donna, do you have a minute?
I need your help.

366
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,230
Of course.
What's going on?

367
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,800
Louis is out of control.

368
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,509
When Esther got married
out of control,

369
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,370
or when Harvey made senior
partner out of control?

370
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,540
Worse.

371
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,919
Shit.
What did he do?

372
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,559
He just went off
on the associates.

373
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,650
He was abusive
and cruel and ugly.

374
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,959
Donna, I have never seen Louis
like this before.

375
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,399
Rachel,
if what you're saying is true,

376
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,250
then we need to figure out why,

377
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,820
because with Louis,
there's always a reason--

378
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,399
Tara broke up with him
last night.

379
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,369
- Oh, my god.
- I was there when it happened.

380
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,439
This is not something that
he's going to get over quickly.

381
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,439
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying that

382
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,339
I think I should
take over the associates

383
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,309
until he's able to get
his emotions under control.

384
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,570
Rachel,
taking the associates away

385
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,340
isn't exactly
gonna stabilize him.

386
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,649
That's the one thing he has.

387
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,649
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm telling you,

388
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,050
if we're not careful, someone's
gonna do something to him,

389
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,489
and he'll be lucky
if it's just suing him.

390
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,989
Did you tell him that?

391
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,020
I tried to,
and he bit my head off

392
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,969
the minute I walked
into his office, so...

393
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,369
Okay, I'll talk to him.

394
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,939
But I'm gonna need you to tell
me exactly what he did first.

395
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,619
Whatever it is,
I don't have time, Donna.

396
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,079
From what I heard,
you had time

397
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,510
to go off on the associates
this morning.

398
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,349
Who told you that?
That's bullshit.

399
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,910
Are you telling me you didn't
go off on Brian Altman

400
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,350
and then make a horrible comment

401
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,319
about Stephanie Patel's
sex life?

402
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,350
- It's called discipline, Donna.
- It's called actionable, Louis.

403
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,359
You're lucky that there isn't a
lawsuit on your desk right now.

404
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,920
Well, thank you
for your counsel.

405
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,729
I know what I'm doing.
Louis, I am trying

406
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,990
to be understanding,

407
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,599
but I think Rachel should handle
the associates for right now.

408
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,430
- Is that a joke?
- No, it's not.

409
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,109
Well, then let me explain

410
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,949
a little something
to you called pecking order.

411
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,040
See, I am up here.
Rachel's down here.

412
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,379
And you don't give dominion
over your associates

413
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,079
to someone down here.
I know that,

414
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,640
but I also know that Tara
broke up with you last night,

415
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,110
and you're not
in your right mind.

416
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,919
I don't want to hear
that name again.

417
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,519
Louis, all I'm saying is
if you don't deal with it,

418
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,519
you're gonna keep abusing
the associates,

419
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,350
and then we're gonna have--
Hey, Donna, you know what,

420
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,650
I didn't want to do this,
but I did leave one name

421
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,759
off the chart.

422
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,059
Me.
Rachel.

423
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,390
You.

424
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,599
So don't you tell me what to do.

425
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,145
Louis, I'm gonna let that go,
because I know you're hurting,

426
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:51,400
but that right there
is exactly why I'm right,

427
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,709
because if you're willing
to talk to me like that,

428
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,480
god help those associates.

429
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,569
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, is this Dr. Feelgood?

430
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,710
'Cause I'd like to schedule an
appointment as soon as possible.

431
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,160
<i>I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong number.</i>

432
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,169
This is Dr. I have work to do.

433
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,570
Well, in that case, I'd like
to schedule an appointment

434
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,579
as soon as possible.

435
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,149
Harvey, why exactly
are you calling me?

436
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,579
First, answer me this:
How many times

437
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,979
have you considered
picking up the phone

438
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,580
and telling me
that you've reconsidered

439
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,455
since you said yes?
Four.

440
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:36,119
If you don't count right now.

441
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,680
<i>Then let's just say
I'm calling to tell you</i>

442
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,750
that I've been
in a room full of models

443
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,099
for the last hour,
and all I can think of is you.

444
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,099
<i>Still thinking
of cancelling on me?</i>

445
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,169
No, Harvey.

446
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,109
I'm looking forward
to our dinner as well.

447
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,749
Did you move up the date
of our wedding

448
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,610
and forget to tell me?

449
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,680
No, I got to get dressed up
for this thing

450
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,589
that Harvey and I are going to
for a client.

451
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,620
A thing for a client.

452
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,629
That's not very specific.

453
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,869
Uh, yeah, I mean, it's just
kind of hard to explain.

454
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,639
Hmm, does it involve
three dozen models

455
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,800
and 1,000 bottles of vodka?

456
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,500
I guess it's not that
hard to explain.

457
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,079
Mm-hmm.
When were you gonna tell me?

458
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,849
If not before,
then definitely after...

459
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,879
Or never.
It's hard to tell.

460
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,740
I haven't really
thought this through.

461
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,550
- You know I'm kidding, right?
- Yes.

462
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,589
You should come.
I can't.

463
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,050
Katrina and I are taking
the Chippendales public,

464
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,820
so we're gonna meet
with a few of their top dancers

465
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,069
to go over some paperwork.
Probably take all night.

466
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,790
- So that's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

467
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,530
I'm serious, Rachel,
you should come.

468
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,209
I think Harvey got a helicopter.

469
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,200
We should take a ride
around the city.

470
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,209
I can't.
You go.

471
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,679
It's a long story.
I ju--

472
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,779
I might be taking over
the associates,

473
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,210
and if I do,
I just want to be prepared.

474
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,255
Rachel, that's amazing,
but are you telling me

475
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:15,149
that Louis is really ready
to give that up?

476
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,250
That's the long story.

477
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,289
But I'll tell you
about it later tonight.

478
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,820
- I can stay.
- No, you should go--

479
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,699
Great, okay.

480
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,599
I love you.
I love you too.

481
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,849
Donna, before you leave,
can I talk to you for a second?

482
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,570
What is it now?
We're running low

483
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,879
on coffee filters?
Can't find the sweet 'n low?

484
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,240
Or is Louis finally being sued
for being an asshole?

485
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,849
You want to tell me
what's going on,

486
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,549
or you want to keep
firing your pistol

487
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,150
in the wrong direction?

488
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,159
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

489
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,895
I am just sick and tired
of being everyone's go-to

490
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,590
and not getting what I ask for.

491
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,329
I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

492
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,260
but you're
a corporate secretary.

493
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,269
What exactly did you expect?

494
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,980
You really want to know?

495
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,939
I asked Harvey
for a seat at the table.

496
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,309
- What table?
- The partnership table.

497
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,870
- No wonder he shot you down.
- He didn't shoot me down.

498
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,810
He told me he would think
about it,

499
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,689
but I haven't heard anything,
and I don't know now if I will.

500
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,619
One way to get his attention
is to go in there

501
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,650
and take that check you gave him
and rip it the hell up.

502
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,325
- What check?
- The check you gave him

503
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:27,689
for your partnership money.
You didn't give him one,

504
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,920
did you?
No.

505
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,269
Let me tell you something,
Red.

506
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,859
You want a seat at the table,

507
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,760
you got to put some skin
in the game.

508
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,255
There he is.
Hey, Harvey,

509
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:56,050
this was a great idea, huh?

510
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,059
Glad I thought of it.
Are we having fun?

511
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,495
If you call
talking geopolitics

512
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,290
with a model named
Svetlana fun,

513
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,465
then that would be
a big, fat bowl of yes.

514
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:06,090
Easy, tiger.
The bartender's pouring doubles.

515
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,099
Mm.
And what are you getting at?

516
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm having another drink.
I said for you to be careful.

517
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,200
I can handle my liquor.
Okay.

518
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,275
How many fingers
am I holding up, huh?

519
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,239
Huh?
You can't tell, can you?

520
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,609
Who can't handle my liquor now?

521
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,440
I'd tell you to put food in
your stomach, but unfortunately,

522
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,219
I only ordered enough to give
the appearance of having food.

523
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,149
So basically,
you're just trying

524
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,219
to get these guys hammered
so you can drive up the bidding.

525
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,580
No.
I told you,

526
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,480
the guys hitting on the models
aren't serious.

527
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,489
Now I'm telling you...
That the guys

528
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,559
who let themselves get drunk
aren't serious,

529
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,390
which means whoever's left
are the bids

530
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,529
that we have in our hands
at the end of the night.

531
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,129
You knew it the whole time,
didn't you?

532
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,399
Who do you think
you're talking to?

533
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
Good man.

534
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,400
There's just
one small problem.

535
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,449
What if, by accident,
I happen to be one of the people

536
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,070
that let himself get too drunk?

537
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,109
You just might as well
keep drinking,

538
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,010
'cause if we're not having fun,
what the hell are we doing here?

539
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,519
Yes!
Copy that.

540
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,289
Svetlana...

541
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,020
You know this office isn't
gonna pack itself up, right?

542
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,420
It's not packed
because one of us

543
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,190
has been at work
for the last three hours.

544
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,560
The other one of us
was sleeping off

545
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,439
all the work he did last night.

546
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,439
You mean you're hung over
from all the vodka you drank?

547
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,209
Yeah, that's what I just said.

548
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,145
I never should have
hired you back.

549
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,200
Well, it's too late
to fire me now.

550
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,470
Is it?

551
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,515
Because if you were
worth your salary,

552
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,440
you'd ask how many bids
we're sitting on.

553
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,219
I don't have to ask,
because I've got this.

554
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,610
Guest list was 500,

555
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,450
and half of them
came for the girls.

556
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,695
Half of the other half
don't have the capital,

557
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,689
and 60%
of the rest of them woke up

558
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,659
realizing they don't want
to work in the liquor business.

559
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Take, I don't know, what,

560
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,329
47 off the top
for good measure?

561
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,330
Leaves us with three bids.

562
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,330
- Donna told you, didn't she?
- Probably.

563
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,270
Did she bother telling you
what we're doing now?

564
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,409
She didn't have to,
'cause you're Harvey Specter.

565
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,140
You've got one trick, and you
taught it to me years ago,

566
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,619
so let's go.

567
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,259
You know I have more
than one trick, right?

568
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,619
No, I know you think you do,

569
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,219
but just because you put
on a different costume

570
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,620
doesn't make it
a different trick.

571
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,729
Yeah, I liked you better
when you were drunk.

572
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,700
I liked you better
when I was drunk too.

573
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,160
I don't care what they say.
This is bullshit,

574
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,629
and I'm not gonna get played.

575
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,460
Gentlemen, we're so sorry.
It's my first day.

576
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,239
Evidently,
I booked the conference room

577
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,709
at the same time as Harvey.
Bullshit.

578
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,669
You think we don't know
what's going on here?

579
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,639
You double booked the room
to scare us into overbidding.

580
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,100
You're right.
We should have known

581
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,509
a couple of smart guys like you

582
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,370
would never fall for the banana
in the tailpipe.

583
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,240
We brought you down here
just because you were

584
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,689
the only two bidders
who came in at 100 million,

585
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,649
so now, you have to look
each other in the eye

586
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,280
while you go head-to-head.
So here's what's gonna happen:

587
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,459
You got one chance
to write down your best bid.

588
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,295
Winner takes all,
loser goes home.

589
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,520
We'll be back in 15 minutes,

590
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,469
and we better see
some more zeroes.

591
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,499
What if we collude,
right here?

592
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,399
Stick at 100
and you're shit out of luck?

593
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,130
Which, by the way,
is exactly why

594
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,509
you don't double book
a conference room.

595
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,539
There's only one problem
with that.

596
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,439
When we said you two were the
only ones that came in at 100,

597
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,440
we didn't say there wasn't
someone who put down more.

598
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,209
- Axelrod.
- Bingo.

599
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,679
Second bid came
in 20 minutes ago.

600
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,740
So if you two want to collude,
go right ahead,

601
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,310
but it better be for a hell
of a lot more than 100 million.

602
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,420
- How'd it go?
- That depends.

603
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,699
What was Axelrod's second bid?
200 million.

604
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,439
Well, then it doesn't
really matter how it went,

605
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,460
because whatever
those clowns come up with,

606
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,409
Neil Stillman's walking away
with a boatload of cash.

607
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,800
Speaking of boatloads
of cash...

608
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,670
It's a check
for half a million dollars.

609
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,719
I told you I was serious about
becoming a partner, and I am.

610
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,710
- Donna...
- Harvey, be honest.

611
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,590
You haven't given one thought to
what we talked about yesterday.

612
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,249
- I've been a little busy.
- And you've also been

613
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,210
avoiding the subject.
This way,

614
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,450
you have to take me seriously.
I do take you seriously.

615
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,325
Then walk the hell down
to Louis' office

616
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,589
and tell him I'm a partner.
Donna, I can't just ram

617
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,620
every decision down his throat.
Every decision?

618
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,729
You haven't even told him that
you're stepping

619
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,320
into Jessica's shoes yet.

620
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,829
I'm waiting
for the right time.

621
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,590
And if I were a partner,
I would tell you that

622
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,460
the right time was yesterday.
Donna...

623
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,300
Harvey, you think
I'm asking for charity, I'm not.

624
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,709
I am asking for you
to make official

625
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,809
what I have been doing
for years anyway,

626
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,709
which is giving you advice,
like you need to step

627
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,740
the hell up and tell Louis
that you're in charge,

628
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,719
and right this second, you're
either gonna take that advice,

629
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,340
or you're not,
but it is time

630
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,710
that you recognize me

631
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,250
for what I do.

632
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,760
My brother Thomas is
the clever one.

633
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,539
Teaches at Cambridge.
20 hours a week, summers off.

634
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,580
You're not listening to a word
I'm saying, are you?

635
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,809
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.

636
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,579
I've been told
I'm actually quite delightful.

637
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,880
You are.
I'm just a little distracted.

638
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,655
Halfway through appetizers.

639
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,619
Doesn't bode very well
for how you'll be feeling

640
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,380
when our flambé arrives.
It's not that.

641
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,789
Jessica left the firm
last month.

642
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,820
Everyone assumes
that I'm next in line,

643
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,799
and now I've got Donna telling
me that if I don't step up...

644
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,499
Wait a second, I thought you
told me as of the other morning

645
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,869
that you're now head
of the firm.

646
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,739
I am. I just haven't
told Louis yet,

647
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,669
and Donna won't let it go.

648
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,400
I think this may have
been a mistake.

649
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,909
- What?
- You didn't come to me

650
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,479
to date me, you came to me
because you're in the middle

651
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,909
of another crisis
and you need me

652
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,540
to walk you through it.
That's not true.

653
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,879
Of course you don't think
it's true.

654
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,770
If you did,
you would have called my office

655
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,410
and made an appointment.
I don't need an appointment.

656
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,419
I'm sharing things
about my life.

657
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,689
Last time I checked,
that's what people do on dates.

658
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,459
Yes, it's what they do,
Harvey, but on first dates,

659
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,899
they also try to make
the other person feel special

660
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,290
and listened to.
Paula--

661
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,359
Do you know why it's unethical
for a therapist

662
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,560
to go out with her client,
Harvey?

663
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,935
Yeah, of course I do.

664
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:41,690
It's because it's natural
for a client

665
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,299
to transfer feelings of desire

666
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,760
onto his therapist
that aren't real.

667
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,469
- I know that.
- What you may not know

668
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,769
is that it's not unnatural

669
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,839
for a therapist
to feel the same way.

670
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,409
You don't think I've had
fantasies about you?

671
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,340
That one day you'd show up
at my office

672
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,649
as I was heading home
for the night,

673
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,849
and I turn around,
and you'd be there.

674
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,580
You wouldn't say a word, but...

675
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,529
You'd take me
in your arms and kiss me, and...

676
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,859
It would actually be the start
of something special.

677
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,890
Well, I have,

678
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,399
which is why
despite my better judgment,

679
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,899
I'm here with you right now.

680
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,499
- So what's the problem?
- The problem is those fantasies

681
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,960
weren't of me being
a therapist to a man

682
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,400
who's still too afraid
to admit that he needs help,

683
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,739
much less take control
of a firm that bears his name.

684
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,670
Thank you for dinner, Harvey.

685
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,749
If you need a session,
call my office.

686
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,349
Unfortunately,
I can't see you anymore,

687
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,580
but I can give you
a recommendation

688
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,989
for someone who can.

689
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,560
- Louis, what can I do--
- Do for me?

690
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,510
You could tell me from now on
if you have a problem with me,

691
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,600
you'll take it up with me
instead of going behind my back.

692
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,739
- What?
- That's right.

693
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,570
You think I don't know the whole

694
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,909
"Rachel should be in charge
of my associates"

695
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,670
bullshit came from you
and not Donna?

696
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,449
You're right.
It was from me.

697
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,389
And I came to you first,
and you bit my head off.

698
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,489
Well, then let me tell you
in a way

699
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,559
that won't harm
your pretty little head,

700
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,829
because I clearly forgot what a
delicate little flower you are.

701
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,689
Those associates are mine,

702
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,520
and the only way
you're ever gonna get them

703
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,499
is if you pry them
from my cold, dead hands.

704
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,689
Donna, unless
it's an emergency--

705
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,549
It is an emergency.

706
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,950
Harvey, I need to know
what you're doing about me.

707
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,959
Donna, right this second
is not the time.

708
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,829
<i>It is the time,
because if somebody doesn't</i>

709
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,829
do something about Louis soon,

710
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,629
this firm is gonna end up being
sued by our own associates.

711
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,490
I don't have the authority
to do anything,

712
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,899
and you don't even know
what I'm talking about.

713
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,960
Okay, Donna.

714
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,600
You win.
You're a partner.

715
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,510
Harvey.

716
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,050
We got a problem.

717
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,459
What is it now?

718
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,560
Take a look.

719
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,559
Where'd you get this?

720
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,260
It doesn't matter
where I got it.

721
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,569
It's out there.

722
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,299
You can't be sure
Neil knew this.

723
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,360
What difference
does that make?

724
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,309
Because if he didn't know,

725
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,409
it's just bad luck.
Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.

726
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,079
He knew.
He kept it from us,

727
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,609
and he kept it from the guys
buying his company.

728
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,470
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

729
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,049
I also know you still have time
to go stop this sale

730
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,849
from going through.
Are you kidding?

731
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,989
They signed the documents.
It's already gone through.

732
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,480
Money hasn't
changed hands yet,

733
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,019
so you still have time
to stop it.

734
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,519
- Mike--
- Harvey, if you don't

735
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,250
get over there
and find out before--

736
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,859
All right.
I'll handle it.

737
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,320
- And where are you going?
- I need to talk to Louis.

738
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,390
Whatever it is, it's gonna
have to wait until tomorrow,

739
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,539
because if you don't
get over there

740
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,399
before that money changes hands,

741
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,630
you are opening us up
to a shitload of trouble.

742
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,310
Kind of creepy in here
at night, isn't it?

743
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,949
Oh, I don't know.
I find it kind of peaceful.

744
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,419
Then why get rid of it?
And more importantly,

745
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
why'd you need the sale
to go through so quickly?

746
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,059
I told you,
I have another opportunity.

747
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,090
And what if I said
the real reason was

748
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,369
you knew you vodka business
was about to be sued

749
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,069
for using
another brand's recipe?

750
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,305
I would say
I did not know that.

751
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,500
- Well, now you do.
- It doesn't change a thing.

752
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,039
Those two dipshits already
signed the agreement.

753
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,500
Neil, this looks a hell of
a lot like you're asking me

754
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,909
to be a party to fraud.
I'm asking you to do your job.

755
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,010
Look out for my interests,
and take me at my word.

756
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,060
If I have reason to believe
that you're lying to me,

757
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:52,610
which I do--
The only thing you have

758
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,919
reason to believe is that
I will fire you

759
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,950
if you don't do this for me
and then find someone who will,

760
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,529
so this thing is gonna get done
whether you do it or not.

761
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,465
The only thing
that happens if you don't

762
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:05,629
is that the world will know
what people suspect already:

763
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,460
That you can't fill
Jessica's shoes.

764
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,609
How long do you think
it's gonna take after that

765
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,379
before every one of your clients
starts to leave you?

766
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,940
So you tell me right now,

767
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,679
are you in or not?

768
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,625
- Shit. Oliver.
- What's up, Mike?

769
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:31,520
How's your new job?
I'm sorry.

770
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,559
I swear I was gonna tell you.
Yeah, I heard,

771
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,620
but I guess when you move on,
you move on, right?

772
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,629
- Come on, it's not like that.
- Bullshit, it's not like that.

773
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,560
You left, Mike,
after everything you said.

774
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,969
Would you please
just let me explain?

775
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,599
I fought for your goddamn job.

776
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
I know that, and I will
always be grateful for it,

777
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,379
but I am telling you,
it's better this way, because--

778
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,139
Better for who?
Based on that extra cash

779
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,070
that you had to throw at Nathan?

780
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,149
I'd say it's better for you.
For everybody.

781
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,985
I can still have cases
with the clinic.

782
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,540
You and I can still
work together.

783
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,480
- Lucky me.
- Oliver, the only reason I went

784
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,719
back is that Harvey committed
to doing pro bonos, all right?

785
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,380
Half of my cases,

786
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,059
the kind the clinic does,
only this time,

787
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,059
with the resources
of a big firm behind us.

788
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,459
Oh, really?
What are you working on

789
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,120
right now, Mike?
What?

790
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,469
What's your first case back?
Eminent domain?

791
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,529
Civil rights violation?
Oliver, come on,

792
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,160
it's not that--
Tell me your first case back

793
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,539
isn't carrying water
for some corporate big shot,

794
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,210
and I'll shut my mouth
right now.

795
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,639
Marissa was right.

796
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,540
All you were doing with us
was biding your time.

797
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,565
- What the fu-- is going on?
- What do you mean?

798
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:45,160
Case is over.
You said you'd move.

799
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,099
I'm just getting
the ball rolling.

800
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,630
I can't work on my own cases
if I don't have my own office.

801
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,099
Listen, Mike.

802
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,030
You let the goddamn sale
go through.

803
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,039
- You don't understand.
- I understand that you said

804
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,570
that you wanted one last case
together before you stepped up,

805
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,079
but you clearly are
not ready to step up,

806
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,579
so I got to get
my pro Bono cases in

807
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,540
before this place
doesn't even exist anymore.

808
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,610
Are you finished,
or do you have a minute to hear

809
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,780
why I let the sale go through?
Oh, no, I don't care.

810
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,689
Mike, I have no proof he knew.
He's Jessica's client.

811
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,620
How's it gonna look
if he tells the world

812
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,199
that we can't handle
his business anymore?

813
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,069
Well, I'll tell you
how it looks right now.

814
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,140
It looks like you're afraid
and you're not in charge.

815
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,799
Okay, you say something
like that to me,

816
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,460
you better get ready for a hit,

817
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,069
because I am doing
the best I can.

818
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,730
No, Harvey,
you're not doing shit.

819
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,600
You're hiding,
'cause you're afraid.

820
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,279
You're afraid to take
responsibility for this firm,

821
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,749
and you won't admit it
to yourself.

822
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,849
I don't have
to listen to this.

823
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,249
Well, you're going to,

824
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,180
'cause way back when,
you cared enough about me

825
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,689
to tell me the same thing
to my face,

826
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,689
and I'm just
returning the favor.

827
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,629
I'm not her, Mike.

828
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,830
I'm not her.
You don't have to be her.

829
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,239
You just have to go back
to being you.

830
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,600
The Harvey I met the day
you hired me,

831
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,349
he would have gone in there
and told Neil Stillman

832
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,770
to go fu-- himself.

833
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,210
So it's up to you.

834
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,589
You can keep hiding out
in Jessica's shadow,

835
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,149
or you get out of it

836
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,580
and start being
Harvey goddamn Specter.

837
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:37,109
Do you find it peaceful here
in the day too?

838
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,410
If you're here to bring me
my check, then the answer's yes.

839
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,749
I'm here to tell you
that we stopped the sale.

840
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,710
What did you just say?

841
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,580
We're not taking part
in your fraud

842
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,659
so that you can dump
your shitty company.

843
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,729
You son of a bitch, I don't
remember giving you a choice.

844
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,065
Well, you did,
because your exact words were,

845
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,690
"Do it, or you're fired."
Then you're goddamn fired.

846
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,099
You can let us go if you want,
but the second you do,

847
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,699
we're putting out
a press release saying

848
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,530
Pearson Specter Litt
no longer represents clients

849
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,679
we feel are unethical
in their divestiture practices.

850
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,109
You can't do that, that's
attorney-client privilege.

851
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,809
No, it's not, because
we're not gonna name you.

852
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,779
But you can bet your ass
the whole world

853
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,710
is gonna know
who we're talking about.

854
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,389
What do you want from me?

855
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,759
Are you asking me
as my client?

856
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,659
Because I don't give
free legal advice.

857
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,829
Yes, okay.
You're still my attorney.

858
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,429
In that case,
here's what's gonna happen:

859
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,729
You're gonna go into business

860
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,599
with the guys
whose process you stole.

861
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,829
You're gonna quietly give them
10% of your company,

862
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,730
you're gonna triple your price,
and you're gonna have

863
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,739
a very public feud
over whose vodka tastes better.

864
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,539
And then we both profit
from a war

865
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,539
between two brands that have
the exact same product.

866
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,009
Win-win.

867
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,570
Maybe you are
as good as Jessica.

868
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,610
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm not.

869
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,489
But the thing
we have in common is

870
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,659
we're never gonna be bullied
by any of our clients.

871
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,770
All right, Louis,
I've tried to be reasonable,

872
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,879
but I'm not gonna sit around
and watch this anymore.

873
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,779
As of this moment,
you're no longer

874
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,679
in charge of the associates.
Says you and what army?

875
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch that.

876
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,189
- I said you can't do that.
- Oh, yes, I can,

877
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,829
because even though Harvey
clearly didn't tell you,

878
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,050
as of last night,
I'm a senior partner.

879
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,789
- You're what?
- That's right.

880
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,089
I gave Harvey a check
for half a million dollars.

881
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,720
I'm a partner now, Louis,

882
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,529
which means your whole

883
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,860
"you're up here
and I'm down here" bullshit,

884
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,599
not anymore.
Partner?

885
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,230
You're not even a lawyer.
Neither are

886
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,809
the chief operating officers
of four

887
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,569
of the top nine firms
in the world.

888
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,570
This is bullshit.
I didn't agree to any of this.

889
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,249
I don't care whether
you agreed to it or not.

890
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,509
You're gonna live with it.
And I don't give a shit

891
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,079
what your supposed title is.
I'm not giving up my associates.

892
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,840
And if you think you're gonna
leave this bathroom

893
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,810
without giving me
the respect I deserve--

894
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,555
I'm not giving up
my associates.

895
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:01,519
- That's enough.
- Harvey, what the hell

896
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,689
kind of shit did you pull?
Shut up and listen, Louis.

897
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,620
Donna asked for a seat
at the table,

898
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,569
and I gave her one,
because when she worked for me,

899
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,920
she had my back,

900
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,090
and would kill anyone
coming for me,

901
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,705
and when she worked for you,
she did the same exact thing,

902
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:15,560
not to mention
if she left tomorrow,

903
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,930
this firm would be a pile
of rubble within 15 minutes.

904
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,609
So then give her a raise.

905
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,579
You don't make her
goddamn senior partner.

906
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,719
If Jessica were here, she'd tell
you to do the same exact thing.

907
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,640
Well, Louis,
Jessica isn't here,

908
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,190
but I am.

909
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,250
- Thank you, Harvey.
- Don't thank me yet.

910
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,859
You asked for a vote.
You got it.

911
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,195
But the person who's gonna
decide when that vote is is me,

912
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:41,690
and I say our first
order of business

913
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,599
is putting out word
that Harvey Specter

914
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,969
is the new managing partner.

915
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,569
Now, you want to vote on that?
Let's do it.

916
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,305
But if it's not unanimous,

917
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,869
we're gonna have a big problem.

918
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,270
No problem here.

919
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,849
What about you, Louis?

920
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,219
You got a problem
with me calling the shots?

921
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,819
No, Harvey.

922
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,755
No problem.
You're managing partner.

923
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,550
Good.
Then I suggest the two of you

924
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,289
get your shit together
before tomorrow,

925
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,989
because right now, I've got
some things to take care of.

926
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,709
I don't want to talk to you
right now, Louis--

927
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,639
I want you to have
the associates.

928
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,009
Whatever you said to Donna,
you were right.

929
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,809
- Louis...
- Rachel, just let me finish

930
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,610
while I'm still able
to get it out.

931
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,589
I know I can be rough on them...

932
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,929
But it's only because
I want to see them

933
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,919
become the best lawyers
they can be.

934
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,650
But I'm not
in the best headspace right now,

935
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,590
and if I keep taking my anger
out on them,

936
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,199
they will not become
great lawyers.

937
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,969
They might not stay
in the law at all, so...

938
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,305
It's better that someone else
takes over for a while,

939
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:58,630
and I cannot think
of a better person than you.

940
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm sorry that I went
behind your back, Louis.

941
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,279
You were right to.

942
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,915
If you had asked me
face-to-face,

943
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:05,809
I don't even know
what I would have done,

944
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,810
and that--just thinking
about that makes me sick.

945
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,649
Rachel, you're family,

946
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,380
and if I lose you too...

947
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,829
Louis, you're not going
to lose me,

948
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,829
but I think
I know what you may need.

949
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,699
Please don't say vacation.

950
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,729
If someone else mentions
Martha's Vineyard one more time,

951
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,760
I swear to God...
I was gonna say closure.

952
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,809
If you're telling me that
I need to talk to Tara--

953
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,630
Louis, you were gonna
get married.

954
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,839
You were gonna be a father.

955
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,870
That can't all end
over a voicemail.

956
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,810
Treat them well.

957
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,039
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

958
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,739
You don't have the balls
to fill Harvey's office.

959
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,409
Okay, Donna,
just to be clear,

960
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,409
balls do not make the man.

961
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,709
- That's not what Rachel says.
- What does that even mean?

962
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,870
I think we both know
what that means.

963
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,879
Donna, for the record,
my balls

964
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,410
are within normal parameters.

965
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,949
So you just come down here
to give me shit,

966
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,749
or was there maybe
another reason?

967
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,949
What other reason
would I have?

968
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,450
I can't think of a single one.

969
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,289
- Then my work here is done.
- Good.

970
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,920
Because I certainly didn't
come down here to tell you

971
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,029
I remember the first time
you were in this office,

972
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,729
and I never thought
I'd see the day

973
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,290
when I told you
congratulations, Mike.

974
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,730
You deserve it as your own.

975
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,110
- Thanks, Donna.
- You're welcome, Mike.

976
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,400
Are you sure
you don't come with it?

977
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,040
I mean, there is a desk
right there

978
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,915
that literally has
your name on it.

979
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,340
Sorry, I wish I could,

980
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,049
but I actually got
a new office too.

981
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,780
- You did?
- Needed one,

982
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,389
because as of tomorrow,
I am officially

983
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,789
the firm's newest
senior partner.

984
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,489
Holy shit.
Are you serious?

985
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,820
Yes.
And from now on, it's,

986
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,459
"Are you serious, ma'am?"

987
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,490
Have you got that, pretty boy?
My God.

988
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,739
Harvey's created a monster,
hasn't he?

989
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,030
You have no idea.

990
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,809
Donna...

991
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,809
It's about time.

992
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,520
Hey.
I know we haven't spoken,

993
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,359
and we didn't exactly
leave things off well,

994
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,760
but...

995
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,499
I just really need
to see you tonight

996
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,499
if at all possible.

997
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,960
Guess you got some skin
in the game after all.

998
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,169
Sure did, Gretchen.

999
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,539
Sure did.
