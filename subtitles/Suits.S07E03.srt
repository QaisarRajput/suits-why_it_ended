1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,337
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:02,608
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made.

3
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,303
Because when people are trying,
they know they're trying!

4
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:07,619
And just because no one
ever wants to try with you

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,809
doesn't give you the right

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,663
to tell me how to run my associates!

7
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:13,057
I think Rachel should
handle the associates.

8
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:15,492
I am up here; Rachel's down here.

9
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:16,994
And you don't give dominion
over the associates

10
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,695
to someone down here.

11
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,397
Which one of my clients are you after?

12
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,898
Because we both know
you can't have Pfizer.

13
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:24,134
- Yes, I can.
- Then make me name partner.

14
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,902
Harvey's making his
friend name partner.

15
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:27,471
He's accused me of being jealous,

16
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,073
and I don't know what to do.

17
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,075
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I'm goddamn jealous!

18
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,411
If you keep letting your
emotions dictate your behavior,

19
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:36,880
you won't need to worry
about being replaced.

20
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:39,083
You'll drive Harvey away all by yourself.

21
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:41,518
Stop apologizing and
start intimidating.

22
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:42,752
That's a hell of a slogan, Harvey,

23
00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:44,488
but what does it actually mean?

24
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,490
It means you go out,
you find a reporter,

25
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:48,092
and you control the narrative.

26
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:49,156
If I lose this case,

27
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:50,778
the only article that's gonna get written

28
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,563
is that I never should've been able
to practice law in the first place.

29
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,699
If you can't figure out a way to win,

30
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,534
maybe I shouldn't have brought
you back in the first place.

31
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,003
A reporter from the
"Times" is coming here.

32
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:00,737
We are doing an interview:

33
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,440
"The Redemption of a Fraudulent Lawyer."

34
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,609
I don't want my behavior

35
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,411
to drive a wedge between us,

36
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:09,613
which means I accept
Alex as name partner.

37
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:11,148
For what it's worth,
Alex is still coming,

38
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,549
but not as name partner.

39
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:14,051
- Really?
- You're right.

40
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:15,619
We can't water down the firm like that.

41
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:22,526
I have to say...

42
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,528
I've been wanting this for so long.

43
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:28,065
Never in my wildest dreams did
I think it would come true.

44
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,581
We're the only name
partners now, Louis.

45
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,883
And I meant it when I said it.

46
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,719
I want us to share things like this.

47
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:38,822
I can't tell you how
happy that makes me.

48
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,383
You're not gonna cry, are you?

49
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:41,334
Are you kidding?

50
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,327
The last time I cried in
here, I messed up the pH.

51
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,894
I had a yeast infection for weeks.

52
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,866
You're not gonna do the other thing you
told me you did in the mud, are you?

53
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,167
Harvey, I told you, that
was a one-time thing.

54
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,802
And believe me, you're no Missy Dietler.

55
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:54,503
Who's Missy Dietler?

56
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,173
- What is he doing here?
- What do you mean?

57
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,175
Harvey and I go mudding
together all the time.

58
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,576
So why don't you lug
yourself out of there

59
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:03,246
- so I can get my tub back?
- This is my tub.

60
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,717
And you always told me it was weird
for male friends to mud together.

61
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,385
But Harvey and I are
more than just friends.

62
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,486
We're best friends.

63
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,892
And then what did you do?

64
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,293
What do you think I did? I called you.

65
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:19,528
Louis, it was just a dream.

66
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:21,564
Just a dream? It was
a goddamn mud-mare.

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,166
Don't you get it?

68
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,567
Harvey let his buddy into my firm.

69
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,335
Now he's in my mud.

70
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,804
I mean, what's next? I
walk into my bathroom

71
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,239
and I find him shitting on my toothbrush?

72
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,413
Louis, we talked about this.

73
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:32,608
If you let this overwhelm you,

74
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,478
you're going to bring about the
thing you're most afraid of.

75
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,347
Did you hear me?

76
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,316
He was in my mud.

77
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,685
How the hell am I not supposed
to let that overwhelm me?

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,487
Well...

79
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,455
has it occurred to you

80
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:49,292
that instead of worrying this Alex person

81
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,795
is going to come between you and Harvey,

82
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,530
you could use this as an opportunity

83
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,966
to make a new friend?

84
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,002
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

85
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,469
Be that as it may,

86
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,371
as I see it,

87
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:05,374
you have a chance to have one more friend

88
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,376
or one less friend.

89
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,378
I suggest you go with one more.

90
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,409
- Donna.
- Rachel.

91
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,485
Can I get you two anything?

92
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,222
Coffee, tea, a copy of your
article in the "Sunday Times"?

93
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,490
Don't need it. Read it yesterday.
Have one at home.

94
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,492
And by one, he means ten.

95
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:24,894
Are you sure you don't want to
take just one more look at it?

96
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,729
I'm good. Thanks, Donna.

97
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,497
Okeydokey.

98
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,532
You have a nice day.

99
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,703
Something's going on
with her, I can tell.

100
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:35,705
What do you mean?

101
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,407
You telling me you didn't
notice that grin on her face?

102
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:40,409
Rachel, you've known
Donna longer than I have,

103
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:41,911
but I didn't see a grin.

104
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,446
I'm telling you, I think
you're imagining it.

105
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,318
Right. Totally imagined it.

106
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,553
- Harvey.
- Rachel.

107
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,621
You know, black can be slimming.

108
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,423
Something to think about next time.

109
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,959
I take it this is
your way of apologizing

110
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,961
for saying you never
should've hired me back.

111
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:00,029
And it gave me a chance
to say the slimming thing.

112
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,699
Sorry, Mike.

113
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,368
You had a point, Harvey.

114
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,308
This is the Radiant Technologies merger.

115
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,877
Yep. Back to one for me.

116
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:15,778
Great, except you
don't need me for this.

117
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:17,747
Deal's done. They sign tomorrow.

118
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,316
Which is why Klein Robinson
thought that I wouldn't mind

119
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,385
if they put a few last-minute
changes in the contract.

120
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:24,128
And a few last-minute changes means

121
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:25,923
they're trying to pull
some last-minute bullshit.

122
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:29,059
Now that sounds like the impressive young
lawyer I read about in the article.

123
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,559
Why don't you figure out
what they're trying to do?

124
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,862
And get it done by lunch.

125
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,700
Who says I need slimming?

126

Don't be hostile.

131
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,707
Louis, what are you doing?

132
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,231
- What?
- Leave him alone.

133
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:21,927
It's his first day.

134
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,700
No, Donna, it's not like that.
I come in peace.

135
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:24,776
You swear?

136
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:25,784
Yes, I brought him a living thing.

137
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,456
- Is it poisonous?
- No, Donna, it is not.

138
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:32,142
Okay. Well, I got my eyes on you.

139
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,211
And that plant.

Alex Williams, Louis Litt.

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,976
I brought you a honeysuckle.

143
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,078
Excuse me?

144
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,526
It's a gesture, since we might've
gotten off on the wrong foot.

145
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,449
You mean because you tried
to poach my biggest client

146
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,218
and keep me from joining the firm?

147
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:51,320
Yes, perhaps that's
the foot we got off on.

148
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,924
But I was hoping we could
get onto other foot.

149
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,959
Here.

150
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:59,796
I appreciate the gesture, Louis.

151
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:03,465
By the way, your work on the
Andersen case was extraordinary.

152
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,434
You followed my Andersen work?

153
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,271
Yes. In fact, it reminded
me of my Pricehouse strategy.

154
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,973
Truth be told, I based it
on your Pricehouse strategy.

155
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,509
Get the fuck well then, you
took it to a whole other level.

156
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:15,621
Thank you, Louis.

157
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,948
I'm sorry about the poaching.

158
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,382
Don't worry about it.

159
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,121
Hey, would you like to grab lunch?

160
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:28,224
Eating at your desk is no way
to celebrate your first day.

161
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,193
You're right, it's not.

162
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:31,861
I'll meet you at the lobby at 1:00.

163
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,529
Sounds good. And thanks for the plant.

164
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,431
You're welcome.

165
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,133
I don't know if you care about
this, but cats love it.

166
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,268
Oh, I know. We've got
two tabbies at home

167
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,903
that are gonna go crazy
over that bad boy.

168
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,404
- Tabbies?
- Yup.

169
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,340
Holy shit, I'm gonna make a reservation

170
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,310
at the best restaurant in
the city, you... BFF, you.

171
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:49,912
Son of a bitch.

172
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,649
Mr. Reyes?

173
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,484
- Yes.
- Mike Ross.

174
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,986
They said you wanted to see me?

175
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,087
Yes, thank you for taking the time.

176
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,394
Of course.

177
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,285
Yeah.

178
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,860
I read your interview yesterday.

179
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:05,527
And my son was in prison too.

180
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:08,564
But... unlike you,

181
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,532
he didn't make it out.

182
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:14,136
This says your son
died of a heart attack.

183
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,505
Yes, a heart attack out of nowhere.

184
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,074
You think they're hiding something.

185
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,375
Well, they won't take my calls

186
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,244
or answer my letters.

187
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,945
What would you think?

188
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:24,513
I'd think that there
might be something wrong.

189
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:27,316
But that doesn't mean that there is.

190
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:29,919
Mr. Ross, my son was 28 years old.

191
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,255
And he was up for parole next month.

192
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,257
There's something they're not telling me.

193
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,225
All right, I'll look into it.

194
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,263
But I'm not gonna be able
to get to this for a few days.

195
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,664
A few days. Why can't you start now?

196
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,234
Because I have a deal
with my firm that allows me

197
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,170
to do cases like this, but
not only cases like this.

198
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,239
And right now, I'm in the
middle of something else.

199
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:53,142
Mr. Ross, the last lawyer I talked to

200
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,344
said there was some kind of a statute

201
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,514
that says I only have another
two weeks to file a lawsuit.

202
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:01,217
And I'm telling you, two weeks
should be more than enough time,

203
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:05,321
but I... I can't drop everything
just to take your case.

204
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,089
I understand.

205
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,958
But...

206
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,228
Chris was caught with
an ounce of marijuana.

207
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,130
He never should have been
there in the first place.

208
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,232
And if time runs out on this

209
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:21,070
and I couldn't get him justice...

210
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:23,406
Okay.

211
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,007
I'll see what I can do.

212
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,712
Stephanie, we need to
talk about this assignment.

213
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:32,415
Is there a problem with it?

214
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,716
Yes, the problem is you didn't do it.

215
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,618
Jason did.

216
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:40,456
Because Jason is better at
cataloging procedure than I am.

217
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,325
Right, but if you don't do
the things you're not good at,

218
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,557
you'll never get better.

219
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,771
The thing is, I don't really want to
get better at cataloging procedure.

220
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:47,629
I know that,

221
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,633
just like I didn't want to be a
paralegal specializing in research

222
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,229
for as long as I was.

223
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,597
But it turns out we had a case
last year that we only won

224
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,739
because I was outstanding at research.

225
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,043
Okay, I see your point.

226
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,312
- I won't do it again.
- Good.

227
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:06,015
Because I have another case
that requires some procedure

228
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,684
to be catalogued, and I put
it aside especially for you.

229
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:12,621
But Stephanie, I want your word

230
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,324
that you won't pawn it off on Jason.

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,059
You have my word.

232
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:28,004
Well, look who it is.

233
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,439
Don't tell me, you feel bad
about canceling the other night

234
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,008
and now you're dying to make it up to me.

235
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,675
It's as though you read my mind.

236
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,677
One of my many skills.

237
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,713
How does dinner tonight sound?

238
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,116
How does having it at my place sound?

239
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,013
You're a crafty one, aren't you?

240
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,052
What? I've got some steaks

241
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,620
I've been wanting to throw on the grill.

242
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:46,422
No, you want to have
dinner at your place

243
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,743
'cause it's the closest restaurant
in the city to your bedroom.

244
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,393
Did you read that in "Zagat's"?

245
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:52,128
No, I read your mind.

246
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,562
Then what time am I thinking?

247
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,431
How about 8:00?

248
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,333
Better make it 8:30. I
got to go buy some steaks.

249
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,338
Good, you're here.

250
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:05,275
Tell me you figured out what bullshit
they're trying to sneak into this deal.

251
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,608
They're not trying to
sneak anything into it.

252
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,477
They're trying to get out of it.

253
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:10,546
That doesn't make sense. They
came to us for this merger.

254
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,114
They must've gotten a better offer,

255
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,115
because they buried an escape clause

256
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,051
in the addendum.

257
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,553
- You know what we have to do.
- Yes, I do.

258
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:20,056
But you're gonna have
to do it without me.

259
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,390
Something's come up, it's on a deadline,

260
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,125
and I need to take care of it.

261
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,094
- What kind of thing?
- A pro bono thing.

262
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,563
Since when does one for
me mean two for you?

263
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:30,466
Harvey, a man died in prison
and it doesn't smell right.

264
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,334
Also, the only reason I
found out about it is

265
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,869
I took your advice and
did that interview.

266
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,637
So it's my fault that
you're dropping my case?

267
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,506
Yeah, I like to look at it that way.

268
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:41,110
Seriously, go get 'em.

269
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,211
Thanks, Harvey.

270
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,183
The last guy brought me a plant.

271
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,717
Let me guess, the last guy was Louis.

272
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:49,702
You got it.

273
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:52,489
Well, I guarantee my welcome
gift is a lot more fun than his.

274
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,356
Since when is a merger signing fun?

275
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,559
Since the guys on the other
side are trying to rip us off

276
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,194
and think we don't know.

277
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,628
Why didn't you tell me
that in the first place?

278
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,430
Come on. I'll fill you
in on the way over.

279
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,432
Wait, the meeting's now?

280
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,633
Yeah, is that a problem?

281
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:06,602
I told Louis we'd get lunch.

282
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,504
Business trumps lunch.
Louis'll understand.

283
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,905
Just call him and let him know.

284
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:18,647
Alex, hi, I was just
on my way to meet you.

285
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,549
About that, Louis. I
have to reschedule.

286
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,684
A work thing came up. I
hope you understand.

287
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,186
Yeah, of course.

288
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:27,123
- Business comes first.
- Thanks.

289
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,624
We'll do it another time.
In fact, I'm free all week.

290
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,295
Louis? You okay?

291
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:34,696
Yeah, I'm okay.

292
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:37,699
I... it's allergy season.

293
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:40,369
I... I think it's probably best
that we don't have lunch today.

294
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:43,372
I... my... my chest
feels like a vice.

295
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,542
All good?

296
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:48,210
I think so.

297
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,212
What kind of plant did
he get you, anyway?

298
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:51,241
Honeysuckle.

299
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,603
I never knew that was an indoor plant.

300
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:55,584
Can be.

301
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,253
Matter of fact, our
cats are gonna love it.

302
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:00,322
- You have cats?
- Why you gotta be like that?

303
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,491
- Why you gotta have cats?
- I like my cats.

304
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,293
No, you don't.

305
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,337
Ms. Snyder? Mike Ross.

306
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,306
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

307
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,309
No, but I'm representing
the family of Chris Reyes.

308
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,245
Hoping that name does.

309
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:24,680
Of course.

310
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:25,814
Any time an inmate dies,

311
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,749
we take it very seriously.

312
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,585
But not seriously enough to
give an accounting of his death

313
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,853
despite repeated requests by his family.

314
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,922
I received no such requests.

315
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,524
It's a shame you didn't call first.

316
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,925
I could've prepared something.

317
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,561
I didn't want you to be prepared,

318
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:40,396
'cause I want to know
what actually happened.

319
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,431
Mr. Ross, when you do what I do,

320
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,400
you get used to people assuming
the worst about your company,

321
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:45,834
so I would appreciate a little respect.

322
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,469
Ms. Snyder, when you do what I do,

323
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,870
you get used to companies
proving you right,

324
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:52,408
so I would appreciate a little action.

325
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,318
Apparently Mr. Reyes was in a fight.

326
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:05,755
He was sent to solitary, where he
complained of difficulty breathing.

327
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,789
A doctor was called and
delivered treatment.

328
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,825
Unfortunately, he died a few hours later.

329
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,363
Well, if he was in a fight, there
has to be an incident report.

330
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,331
That may be, but you have
no right to access it.

331
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:17,493
We're a private corporation.
That's privileged.

332
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,902
Okay, then how about you give me
the names of the guards who saw it?

333
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:21,704
You know I can't give you that either.

334
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,205
And you know that if I
bring a suit against you,

335
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,691
I'm gonna get all of this anyway.

336
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:27,788
So why don't you save
yourself the publicity

337
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:29,445
and just give it to me now?

338
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:38,858
I don't care what that thing says.

339
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,194
It's not the whole story.

340
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:43,296
Mr. Reyes, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

341
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,897
but I'm not seeing a case.

342
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,567
It says there that my son

343
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,502
died alone in solitary confinement.

344
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,803
Why didn't they take him to an infirmary?

345
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,405
Because he was seen by a doctor.

346
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,773
There was an explanation
for his symptoms.

347
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,641
I know you think I'm just a man

348
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,743
who can't accept his child's death.

349
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,612
But that's not true.

350
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,182
Mr. Reyes, a fight in prison
can elevate your heart rate.

351
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,583
Nobody knows that better than I do.

352
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:06,586
What they're saying
happened is plausible.

353
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,355
Then you didn't know my son.

354
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,257
I told you, he was up
for parole next month.

355
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:13,326
He wouldn't have gotten into a fight.

356
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:15,328
What exactly are you saying?

357
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:16,496
One of those inmates

358
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,865
must have come for him.

359
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,334
And that prison didn't give
enough of a shit about Chris

360
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,636
to protect him.

361
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,372
Mr. Reyes, I know that you came to me

362
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,939
because that article said
I wanted to help people

363
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,409
and I do, but...

364
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:32,245
I know. My son's already dead.

365
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,947
But if they could've stopped
this and they didn't,

366
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,250
it's going to happen again.

367
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:48,728
Chase, I'd like you to meet
our newest senior partner,

368
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,530
Alex Williams.

369
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,465
Two senior partners
just to sign a contract.

370
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,300
Seems excessive.

371
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,669
It would be, but we're
not here to sign anything.

372
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:57,837
What are you talking about?

373
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:59,572
He must think I'm pretty dumb.

374
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,374
People always underestimate
a pretty face.

375
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,742
Maybe he just thinks you're dumb.

376
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,377
'Cause of the droopy eyes.

377
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,379
Valid theory. Not unprecedented.

378
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:07,914
Nobody thinks you're dumb.

379
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,416
Then why the hell did
you sneak this clause

380
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,317
to the back of my goddamn contract?

381
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:12,785
We didn't sneak anything.

382
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,512
We were just looking at our options.

383
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,016
Bullshit.

384
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:18,859
You're trying to use us as a stalking
horse so you can merge with Gorban.

385
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,760
So what if I was?

386
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,562
What are you going to do to stop it?

387
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:24,564
I'll tell you what I did.
I called Alex.

388
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,333
And what I did was call my
law school roommate at the DOJ

389
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,302
about the anti-trust issues raised by you

390
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:30,370
merging with Gorban.

391
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,407
What do you want?

392
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:36,042
We want you to live up to the terms

393
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,478
- of the original agreement.
- With one exception.

394
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:40,580
You're gonna take a step down.

395
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,715
- I'm not stepping down.
- Yes, you are.

396
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,452
This new company doesn't
need two outside counsels.

397
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,587
Particularly one who
tries to pull shady shit

398
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,689
without his client knowing about it.

399
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,691
Looks like you're gonna
take one for the team, Chase.

400
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:55,962
The question is, would you like
to bow out or get kicked out?

401
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:03,669
How the hell can I calm down?

402
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,338
I was watching my mud-mare come true.

403
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:07,006
You don't know what you saw, Louis.

404
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,841
I'm sorry, I forgot I was blind.

405
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:11,344
I must've dialed your number
using my Braille-a-phone.

406
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,878
You know that's not what I meant.

407
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,614
No, you're right, it's
the only explanation

408
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,549
as to why I wouldn't
know what I just saw,

409
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:19,819
which was Harvey and Alex,
arm in arm, laughing at me!

410
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,054
Louis, listen to me.

411
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,889
We knew this was going to happen.

412
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,625
That I was gonna be
betrayed by my best friend?

413
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,627
No, that you were going
to try to be good...

414
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:29,695
- Did it.
- Try not to be you.

415
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:30,464
Accomplished.

416
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:33,477
Then perceive a potentially
nonexistent slight

417
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:36,002
and go straight to stage seven.

418
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,703
What the hell are you talking about?

419
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,340
Panic, sorrow, self-loathing,

420
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:45,845
hatred, justification,
self-loathing again, and rage.

421
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,481
I call it the seven stages of Louis.

422
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,982
You are so full of shit,

423
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:52,718
and you're a total fraud,
and I'm actually gonna...

424
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,387
ah... I see your point.

425
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,789
Stage 7b.

426
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,359
No one likes a gloater, Stan.

427
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,327
Be that as it may.

428
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:02,828
You need a strategy, Louis.

429
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:05,064
For now and the next time this happens.

430
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,400
The breathing exercises.

431
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,602
It's the only thing
that's ever worked for you.

432
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:14,006
What would I do without you, Doc?

433
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:17,810
No need to go down
that road, my friend.

434
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:21,981
Now, picture yourself near the ocean,

435
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,883
laying in the sand.

436
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,718
Isn't it lovely?

437
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,922
I got to say, that was pretty fun.

438
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,791
I agree.

439
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,926
I always wanted to pretend
I had a friend at the DOJ.

440
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,161
Not a bad first day.

441
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,430
Speaking of my first day,

442
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,864
what's up with that Louis Litt guy?

443
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,033
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

444
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,502
First he tries to stop
me from coming over,

445
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:43,903
then he brings me a plant,

446
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,805
then when I called to cancel lunch,

447
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,140
I could've sworn he was
about to cry or something.

448
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:49,542
What?

449
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,779
Louis is...

450
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,481
he's complicated.

451
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,850
What do you mean, complicated?

452
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,386
Well, you know he didn't
want you here, right?

453
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:02,522
The thing is, it wasn't professional.

454
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,957
What else could it be?

455
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,559
He was worried that I was gonna be

456
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,160
better friends with you than him.

457
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,976
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

458
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:11,897
Does he have a crush on you?

459
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,700
No.

460
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:15,901
Yeah, he totally has a crush on me.

461
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,570
But not like that.

462
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:20,072
Maybe this'll work. You ever seen "MASH"?

463
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,174
Of course, but what does
that have to do with this?

464
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:26,246
Louis is Frank Burns.

465
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,351
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

466
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:29,791
Now I totally get it.

467
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,299
- You sure?
- Yeah.

468
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,679
He loves you, hates you,
and wants to be you,

469
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,621
all at the same time.

470
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:35,821
You do get it.

471
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:39,016
Yeah, I do. The question is,

472
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,493
are you sure he's gonna be okay with me,

473
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,090
or do I have to watch out?

474
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,829
Well, let me ask you this.

475
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:46,629
Did you tell him your cats are
gonna love his honeysuckle?

476
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,500
Yes.

477
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:48,735
Then I think you'll be fine.

478
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:55,074
Excuse me. You guys know Chris Reyes?

479
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,909
Doesn't ring a bell.

480
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:58,978
That's strange, 'cause
according to the incident report

481
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,946
the three of you were on
duty the night he died.

482
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:03,777
Even if I were, I wouldn't
have anything to say about it,

483
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:04,617
so you can get the fuck out of here.

484
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,929
Hey, come on. I just have a
few questions, that's all.

485
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,115
This is a prison. All questions
go through the main office.

486
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,457
Where do you think I got your names?

487
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,100
I don't give a shit where you got 'em.

488
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,826
You're gonna forget you ever heard 'em.

489
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,628
And if I see your face again,
there's gonna be a problem.

490
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:17,764
Okay, look, I'm not trying
to start any trouble here.

491
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,199
But a man is dead, and I need
to find out what happened.

492
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,067
For a guy who's not looking
to cause any trouble,

493
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,569
you sure don't listen too good.

494
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:24,804
Come on, Drew. Let's go.

495
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,172
That's what he wants.

496
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,040
I'm telling you, he's not worth it.

497
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:42,134
You're one of those assholes

498
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,126
who just love getting the shit
beat out of him, aren't you?

499
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,725
No, I've had the shit beat out of me,

500
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,259
and I can tell you, I
didn't love it at all.

501
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,561
Then you better get
the hell out of here

502
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,095
before it happens again.

503
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:52,675
I will, just as soon as
you answer my questions.

504
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:53,933
And why would I do that?

505
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:56,001
Because your name is
at the top of the list,

506
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,538
and I'm guessing you
know what that means.

507
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,640
Yeah, I'm the scapegoat.

508
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:02,608
But it also means anything they
get, they know it came from me.

509
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,009
Except you just told me to go to hell

510
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,678
in front of all your buddies,

511
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:08,681
and they saw you meant it.

512
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:11,083
That's why you came
to me at the prison.

513
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:13,686
Now you got cover.

514
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,188
And I suggest you use it.

515
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,123
Because I am gonna find
out what happened here,

516
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,760
and when I do, they are gonna
shield themselves from liability

517
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,895
and I am gonna end up
coming after you instead.

518
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,665
Or you can tell me what I need to know,

519
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,416
and I'll leave you out of it.

520
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,903
Look, I'm the one who pulled
him out of the fight

521
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,905
and threw him in the hole.

522
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,140
He started complaining saying he
was having problems breathing.

523
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:39,413
I told my supervisor, and my supervisor
said he was gonna call the doctor.

524
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:41,947
- That's all I know.
- Bullshit that's all you know.

525
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,269
Look, did Chris get killed
because he was onto something?

526
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,056
No.

527
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,743
Well, that kid, he didn't just up and
get in a fight without good reason.

528
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:48,989
You don't know what
you're talking about.

529
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,856
Look, are the guards corrupt?

530
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:51,724
What the hell did you just say?

531
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,826
- Was somebody out to get him?
- No, he just died!

532
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:55,327
Look, there's no conspiracy.

533
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:56,829
Nobody's evil.

534
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,631
Just cheap.

535
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,266
What does that mean?

536
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,001
It means the only reason
they were able to wale on him

537
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,179
for as long as they did

538
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,340
is 'cause they didn't have
enough of us on duty that night,

539
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:06,773
'cause the prison doesn't
give a shit about anything

540
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,107
except its bottom line.

541
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,063
So what did you do?

542
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,765
So I told him he could have the money,

543
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,581
but if... if he tried
taking those albums,

544
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:21,801
we're gonna have trouble.

545
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,140
This was lovely.

546
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,943
But I have an early morning tomorrow.

547
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:32,812
I think I should get home.

548
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:35,214
Paula, what's going on?

549
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,348
It's nothing.

550
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,851
- Really.
- Nothing?

551
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,319
We had a great night.

552
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:42,055
All of a sudden you have to go?

553
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,890
You wouldn't understand.

554
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,357
Try me.

555
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,830
I had lunch with the woman
who was my mentor today.

556
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,098
And we were having a wonderful time

557
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,199
catching up with each other,

558
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,967
and then... out of the blue,

559
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,269
she asked me if I was seeing anyone.

560
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,271
I said no.

561
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:01,174
Well, we haven't exactly
been seeing each other

562
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,009
for very long. It's
understandable if you...

563
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:04,476
No, it wasn't that, Harvey.

564
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:08,981
- It's that I felt a little...
- What?

565
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:11,084
Ashamed.

566
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,019
Ashamed.

567
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,553
This isn't a small thing,
what we're doing, Harvey.

568
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:17,090
- At least it's not to me.
- It's not to me either.

569
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:21,818
Well, I'm not sure I realized
exactly how not small it is

570
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,162
until today.

571
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,163
I don't understand.
We've been over this.

572
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,865
It's in writing.

573
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,533
There's no violation with
us seeing each other.

574
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,102
This isn't something that I am

575
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:30,203
trying to get away with, Harvey.

576
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:32,238
It's how I'm feeling inside.

577
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:36,408
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

578
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm just saying I think I should
sleep at my place tonight.

579
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,422
Donna, I need to talk
to you about something.

580
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,958
About what?

581
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:53,192
About the fact that I'm pissed off.

582
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,861
What's going on?

583
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,295
I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment

584
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,830
and she handed it off.

585
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:59,165
Did you talk to her about it?

586
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,833
Yes, I did, and she gave me her word

587
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:02,869
that she would never do
it again, but she did.

588
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:04,403
I don't understand. This
has Stephanie's name on it.

589
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:05,972
I don't care whose name is on it.

590
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:07,073
There's no way that that wasn't written

591
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,574
by a first-year associate.

592
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,009
Rachel, please tell
me you're not thinking

593
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,210
about going to Louis with this.

594
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,544
Are you kidding me?

595
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,280
We took Louis off the associates

596
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,315
because of his incident with Stephanie.

597
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,418
If I tell him that she's being
insubordinate, he'll kill her.

598
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,453
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,

599
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:25,191
but maybe you should take a
page out of Louis' book.

600
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,893
What do you mean?

601
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,460
When Louis first took
over the associates,

602
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:31,363
he used to plant a fake
associate and fire him

603
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,132
in front of the entire class on day one.

604
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,995
And I used to think he was crazy,

605
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,709
but Stephanie never would have
pulled something like this with Louis.

606
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,637
Okay, first of all,

607
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,506
that's just not how I operate.

608
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,474
And second of all, they've all been here.

609
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,177
They'd all be able to
tell that it was fake.

610
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:47,079
Then maybe you need to real fire her.

611
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,515
Because this is a second offense
and if you keep letting it go,

612
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,582
where does it end?

613
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:52,118
I'm not gonna do that.

614
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:53,552
Do you mind if I ask you why not?

615
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:56,359
Because I don't want my first
official act to be firing someone.

616
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,598
I understand that, Rachel.

617
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,091
But you better think of something.

618
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:01,027
Because the one thing
that Louis understood

619
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:03,095
was that you've got to come
out of the gate in command,

620
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:05,097
or they're gonna walk all over you.

621
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:12,471
Yes?

622
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,440
Mr. Reyes, it's Mike Ross.

623
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:15,908
I went to the prison, and I
talked to one of the guards.

624
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:17,910
What did he say?

625
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,012
He said all the prison cares
about is their bottom line.

626
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:22,681
So I'm filing a lawsuit tonight.

627
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,951
Thank you so much, Mr. Ross.

628
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:29,255
I thought that article was
maybe too good to be true.

629
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,924
I appreciate that,
Oscar, but don't thank me

630
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
until I get you the answers
you're looking for.

631
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:45,704
You finished the paperwork already?

632
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,539
I might have to give you a raise.

633
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:49,141
Save your money, Harvey.

634
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:50,076
I'm here about something else.

635
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:51,643
What's going on?

636
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,612
I just heard Mike Ross
is handling a pro bono.

637
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:56,515
Yeah, we have a deal. Why?
You need him for something?

638
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:59,518
Yeah, I need him to drop that case.

639
00:24:59,553 --> 00:25:01,354
Why?

640
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:02,922
Because there's a conflict
with Masterson Construction.

641
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,590
Mike's pro bono is against some prison.

642
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,092
And guess who builds those prisons.

643
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:07,526
Wait a second.

644
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,262
Are you telling me to go back on my word

645
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,930
because your client's bullying you?

646
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:12,365
Harvey, I thought we
were in this together.

647
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
- So did I.
- Then get on board.

648
00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:15,101
Because they're not just any client.

649
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,702
They're one of my biggest.

650
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:18,570
And if they leave because
you chose some prisoner

651
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,206
over one of the biggest
developers in the country,

652
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,008
people are gonna get the message

653
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,943
that we don't want to be in
the real estate business.

654
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,278
Did they say they were gonna
give people that message?

655
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:26,979
- Harvey...
- Did they or not?

656
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,381
- They did.
- Drop 'em.

657
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,615
- God damn it...
- I said drop 'em.

658
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,983
- No.
- Excuse me?

659
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,484
I may not be name partner yet,

660
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,253
but you don't get to tell
me who my clients are.

661
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,388
Yes, I do.

662
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,623
Harvey, listen to yourself.

663
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:39,591
It's one pro bono. He just took it.

664
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:41,127
He can drop it.

665
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:45,097
I gave him my word.

666
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,598
And you once gave your word to me

667
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:48,600
and went back on it and I let it go.

668
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:50,702
Because I understood it was business.

669
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:53,005
If this kid doesn't get that,
what the hell is he doing here?

670
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:03,416
Stephanie, I asked you
to come to my office.

671
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:04,750
That was over an hour ago.

672
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:06,385
I was working on the Sanderson brief.

673
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,987
I was about to come down.

674
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:09,621
Well, I need to talk to you now,

675
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:11,324
because you told me that you
wouldn't hand this off,

676
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,159
and you did.

677
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:14,726
No, I told you that I
wouldn't hand it off to Jason,

678
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:16,528
and I didn't.

679
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:17,596
I'm sorry, are you
trying to get out of this

680
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,265
on a technicality?

681
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,667
I'm your supervisor,
not opposing counsel.

682
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:24,337
Rachel, I tried to be nice about this,

683
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:26,538
but I'm a fourth-year associate,

684
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,107
and I'm not wasting my time

685
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,741
on something a first-year could handle.

686
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:32,211
Now, if you don't mind, I would
like to get back to work.

687
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:35,181
Actually, I do mind.

688
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,816
Excuse me, Stephanie,
I'm speaking to you.

689
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,219
It doesn't matter what year you are.

690
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,653
I'm head of the associates.

691
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,555
If I give you an assignment, you do it.

692
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:45,724
And when you give me one
that's worth my time, I will.

693
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,792
What's going on here?

694
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:48,427
Donna, I'm handling it.

695
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:50,062
What's going on is
that I am a grown woman,

696
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:51,464
and I don't need to be
told what to do by someone

697
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,732
with less experience as a lawyer than me.

698
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,534
Then you're really gonna
hate being told what to do

699
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,636
by someone with no
experience as a lawyer.

700
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,271
- Donna...
- Excuse me?

701
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:00,806
I said, you're here, and I'm here.

702
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,541
So unless you want to deal with me,

703
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:05,077
you'll listen when Rachel
tells you something.

704
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:08,214
I was recruited to come here.

705
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:10,483
And I was told that I would be valued

706
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:12,218
for my mind, my billings,

707
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:13,785
and my relationship with my clients.

708
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:15,421
And since I got here,

709
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:17,456
I have had to take shit from Louis.

710
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:20,297
And now you're asking me to
waste my time and my ability

711
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:21,293
on something like this.

712
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,195
- No...
- You're right, Stephanie.

713
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,630
You shouldn't have been
treated like that by Louis.

714
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:26,232
And Rachel and I took care of it.

715
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,367
Now as for your time and ability,

716
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,669
if you don't do whatever
assignment Rachel gives you,

717
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,604
I don't give a shit how good you are.

718
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,306
We are gonna show you the door.

719
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:56,322
Hey. Did you come by to tell me
that the work I did saved your ass?

720
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:59,458
It did, but that's not why I'm here.

721
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:01,292
Harvey, what's going on?

722
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:03,628
You have to drop your pro bono.

723
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:05,196
There's a conflict with
one of our clients.

724
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:06,366
What? Who?

725
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,233
I checked for conflicts
before I took the case.

726
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:09,267
- It's a new client.
- Well, if it's a new client,

727
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:10,602
then let's drop them.

728
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,203
We can't. They're a huge developer.

729
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,472
A developer? I'm suing a prison.

730
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:15,073
I know that, but they're saying...

731
00:28:15,108 --> 00:28:16,641
I don't care what they're saying.

732
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:18,297
That's not a conflict.
That's a shakedown.

733
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:18,895
- Mike...
- No.

734
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,779
You're gonna give me the green light,

735
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,209
and then I find something,

736
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,813
and then you're gonna make me
dump them for no good reason?

737
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:24,450
It's not no good reason.

738
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,519
It's Alex's developer, and
I just brought him in.

739
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,220
I let him lose one of his biggest clients

740
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:30,936
his first week here, it's a disaster.

741
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:33,124
And I let a man die without
getting him justice.

742
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,726
- What the hell is that?
- Listen to me...

743
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,595
Listen to yourself. We had a deal.

744
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,457
Now this clown is asking
me to drop a client

745
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,565
that I made a promise to.

746
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:42,501
Except he's not asking
you to drop him, Mike. I am.

747
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:46,304
And if you don't, that
deal we made... it's over.

748
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:55,279
How could you do that?

749
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:57,248
Do what? I was helping you.

750
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,784
No, Donna, you were undermining me.

751
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,486
Undermining you?

752
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,287
You needed backup. That's
what I'm here for.

753
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,223
No, I needed to handle the situation,

754
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:07,659
which is what I was doing until
you decided to interfere

755
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:09,794
in something that you don't
know anything about.

756
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,397
No offense, Rachel, but I
did know something about it,

757
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,432
and from what I could tell, you
weren't handling it at all.

758
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,334
And you think what you
did was any better?

759
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:18,436
I think I told you that you
need to set the tone early on.

760
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,338
Okay, and the tone that you just set

761
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:23,775
is that if you're not there,
she can walk all over me.

762
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,910
Well, I don't know
what room you were in,

763
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:26,711
but she was doing that anyway.

764
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:28,279
And what does it say about
me if the other associates

765
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,181
see me letting her do that?

766
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:32,150
What it says is that you
trust my leadership style

767
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:33,652
instead of thinking that you
need to fight my fights for me.

768
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,386
Stephanie needed what I gave her.

769
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:37,488
And if you think that was
me fighting your fights,

770
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:38,623
you don't know what you're talking about.

771
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:39,891
Because if it were up to me,

772
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,192
I would've fired her on the spot.

773
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,493
Well then, why didn't you?

774
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:43,828
Because they're not my associates.

775
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:45,296
You're right. They're mine.

776
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:46,464
And I fought for you to get them.

777
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:48,266
And you just belittled me

778
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,535
and embarrassed me in
front of all of them.

779
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:51,786
And that is not something

780
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:54,238
that I thought my friend would do to me.

781
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:55,740
Well, you know what, I never
thought I would say this,

782
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:57,742
but maybe you weren't ready
for your new position.

783
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:59,310
Well, you know what, Donna?

784
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:00,712
Maybe neither were you.

785
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,919
Dr. Lipschitz, I.. I
know you're in a session.

786
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,721
I just wanted to say that you were right.

787
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,890
I was overreacting.

788
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,725
I do not have a problem with Alex.

789
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,894
And... if I ever get triggered again,

790
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,896
I have the deep breathing.

791
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:19,530
Anyway, thanks again.

792
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,399
Auf Wiedersehen.

793
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:22,968
Mike.

794
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:24,803
It's good to see you.

795
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,671
This'll just take a few minutes,
and then it's all yours.

796
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,640
No, it doesn't matter
how long it takes, Louis.

797
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:30,575
We can just charge the time
back to some client, right?

798
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,543
'Cause nobody around here
gives a shit about anything

799
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:33,678
other than making money anyway.

800
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:35,614
Mike, what is going on?

801
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,448
What's going on is that the
only reason I came back here

802
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:38,717
is that Harvey and I made a deal,

803
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:40,318
and it hasn't even been a week,

804
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:41,084
and he's already going back on it.

805
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,988
That's not gonna happen on my watch.

806
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:44,623
Okay? So just slow down.

807
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:45,890
Tell me what the hell
you're talking about.

808
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:52,831
Harvey, we need to talk.

809
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,465
Mike just told me you're
breaking a deal with him.

810
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,867
Well, he shouldn't have told you that,

811
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,268
because that's none of your business.

812
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,703
None of my business?

813
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:00,404
My name's on the wall as much as yours.

814
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,641
Look, if Mike doesn't drop that case,

815
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,009
we lose a major client.

816
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:05,230
- I can't have that.
- No, Harvey.

817
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,712
What we can't have is
you setting a precedent

818
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:10,782
that Alex's clients can run
roughshod all over us.

819
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:11,783
Keep your voices down.

820
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:13,652
Oh, I get it.

821
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,386
So this isn't about me
breaking my deal with Mike.

822
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:17,388
This is about you being jealous of Alex.

823
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:19,024
No, it isn't. I thought
it was a mistake

824
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:20,925
even before I found out
that it was Alex's client.

825
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,694
- Harvey, he has a point.
- Bullshit.

826
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,629
You told me you were afraid
that I was gonna become

827
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,331
better friends with him than
you, and that's what this is.

828
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,868
How dare you say that
to me in front of Donna?

829
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:33,938
I told you that in complete confidence.

830
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,574
This isn't about my
relationship with Alex.

831
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,109
This is about your relationship with Alex

832
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:39,911
and how you're afraid to stand up to him.

833
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:41,913
You want to run that by me again?

834
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,581
I just ran it by you.

835
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,550
What you are doing is a mistake.

836
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:46,951
I don't think so,

837
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:48,720
and Donna doesn't think
so, which means...

838
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:50,621
Actually, Harvey, I do.

839
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,757
And if it's all the same to
you, I can speak for myself.

840
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,827
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

841
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,996
Because the last time you said
if I had something to say,

842
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:59,530
say it in the goddamn meeting.

843
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,499
Well, this is the goddamn meeting.

844
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,434
And I happen to think we
should keep our word to Mike

845
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:04,936
instead of letting some client bully us.

846
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,938
Well, I appreciate the input.

847
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:09,373
But I told you you'd get a vote

848
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,409
when I said there'd be a vote,

849
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:12,877
and this isn't a vote.

850
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,646
As for you, take a look in the mirror,

851
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,649
because the only reason that
you're pissed about this

852
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,720
is your new honeysuckle friend
canceled lunch on you for me.

853
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:31,129
Louis...

854
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,219
Aren't you a little old to be spending
your break in a comic book store?

855
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,800
Everybody has their hobbies, Mike.

856
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,297
Mine's comics.

857
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,855
Yours is helping big corporations
screw over the little guy.

858
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:53,235
Oliver, wait.

859
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,004
I just, I came here because
I owe you an apology,

860
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,707
and... this is my way of doing it.

861
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,041
What's that?

862
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,710
More money to make everything okay?

863
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:04,179
It's a case. It's one
that means a lot to me.

864
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,215
It's about a guy who died in prison.

865
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,217
If it means so much to you,
why don't you do it yourself?

866
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,219
I can't.

867
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,188
We have a conflict with
one of our clients.

868
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,057
Well, that's a nice speech,
Mike, but I'm not interested,

869
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,159
because there's something
in it for you, like always.

870
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,628
Oliver, please, look,
before you say no,

871
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,029
just listen to what I have to say.

872
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,064
I don't need to listen to you anymore.

873
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
God damn it, I almost died in there.

874
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,972
What?

875
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,177
My second night in Danbury,

876
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:38,146
I thought that someone was gonna kill me.

877
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,781
And then my last night,

878
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:42,718
I knew that same guy was
coming for me again.

879
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,185
But I got out.

880
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,589
This kid didn't.

881
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,559
The only thing that's in this for me

882
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:54,162
is making sure that this doesn't
happen to someone else.

883
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:02,237
This seems pretty cut-and-dry, Mike.

884
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,939
That's how they want it to look.

885
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:07,551
I already know they didn't have
enough guard staff on duty that night.

886
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,490
Which means they probably didn't
have enough medical staff either.

887
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,615
Or maybe none at all.

888
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,684
Look, I can't let them get away with this

889
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,085
without handing it off to the one lawyer

890
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,321
I know cares enough to see it through.

891
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,959
Okay, Mike.

892
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:26,328
I'm in.

893
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,869
- Donna, whatever it is...
- Rachel, I'm so sorry.

894
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,405
What I did was wrong and horrible

895
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,072
and showed you no respect,

896
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:39,675
and then you came and
tried to tell me that,

897
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,010
and I made it a thousand times worse.

898
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,780
Why would you do something
like that in the first place?

899
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,147
'Cause I'm new at this.

900
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,284
Then I saw Stephanie
treating you like shit,

901
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,120
and it felt like she
was doing that to me.

902
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,289
Because you're the one
that gave me the job.

903
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,792
Maybe.

904
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,259
And then you told me I cut your legs out,

905
00:34:58,295 --> 00:34:59,994
and that made me feel even worse,

906
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,296
and I took it out on you.

907
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,231
- Donna...
- Rachel, you were right.

908
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,266
I'm not completely ready for this.

909
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,137
And I'm not always gonna
get things right,

910
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:12,173
and I got them really wrong today.

911
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:17,078
Maybe not all wrong.

912
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:19,113
What do you mean?

913
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,885
I thought about it too.

914
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,257
I am finally a member of the bar.

915
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,865
I don't want to supervise
anyone right now.

916
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,768
I just want to be the
best lawyer I can be.

917
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:41,470
I understand.

918
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,340
I'll take care of the associates for now.

919
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,677
Donna.

920
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,078
What made you realize all that?

921
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,446
Let's just say

922
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,348
I was reminded what it feels like

923
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,684
when someone speaks for you
and what they're saying

924
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,854
is the complete opposite
of what you wanted to say.

925
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:01,690
- Louis?
- Harvey.

926
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,259
The one who gave you your new position.

927
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:05,827
Exactly.

928
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,096
I'm so sorry, Donna.

929
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,064
I'm sorry too, Rachel.

930
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:19,741
Harvey, it's late. Whatever it is...

931
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,244
Did you pawn that thing
off to the clinic?

932
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,046
You asked me to drop
it, so I dropped it.

933
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,915
Bullshit.

934
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,383
You gave it to the clinic
you're affiliated with.

935
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,253
The clinic you told me I could
give cases to at my discretion.

936
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:33,121
Maybe you missed the memo.

937
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,924
If our firm is in any way
associated with that case,

938
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,191
we lose a huge client.

939
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:38,827
Harvey, I'm not working on it.

940
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,429
Then you're gonna put that in writing,

941
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,763
and you're gonna deliver
it to Alex's client.

942
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,231
Ironclad Chinese wall.

943
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:44,733
You have nothing to do with this case.

944
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,968
Are you saying you don't trust me?

945
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,202
You saying you didn't
know what you were doing

946
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,071
when you gave it to the clinic?

947
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,242
Okay, Harvey.

948
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:55,777
I'll put it in writing.

949
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,336
I want you word you're
gonna live by what you sign.

950
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,085
You have my word.

951
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:12,761
You wanted to see me?

952
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,429
Yes, I did, I was just wondering,

953
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:18,266
have you redone the assignment
that Rachel gave you?

954
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,300
Not yet.

955
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:21,369
I had a ton on my plate.

956
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:23,438
I was gonna get to it tomorrow.

957
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,942
You're fired.

958
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:30,846
Please, I-I really was going to do it.

959
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,481
I believe you.

960
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,315
But my rule is three
strikes and you're out.

961
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,818
Otherwise, where does it end?

962
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,153
In that case, why not do this publicly?

963
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,490
I don't need to do this
publicly, Stephanie.

964
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,425
When you're not here tomorrow,
people will know what happened.

965
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:48,262
But I do want you to
know, I wish you well.

966
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:50,765
Do you expect me to believe that?

967
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:51,933
I don't know.

968
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,768
But it's true.

969
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:11,953
Before you say anything,

970
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,822
I came here for a reason.

971
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:15,824
Because this is where we met,

972
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,959
but it isn't where I need to be anymore.

973
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,427
Harvey, I don't think...

974
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,195
I just have one question to ask you.

975
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:23,832
Are you worried about what
this woman's gonna think

976
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,834
or because you think what
we're doing is wrong?

977
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:28,169
Because if this is just about
what other people think,

978
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:29,370
it's crazy!

979
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,540
Well, it isn't crazy to me,

980
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:32,641
and I need you to understand that.

981
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,175
I do understand that,

982
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,877
but I also know we have a connection,

983
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,378
and to throw that away

984
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:39,447
because of some figment
of your imagination...

985
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:42,050
It is not a figment of my imagination.

986
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,985
And I'm not worried
about what she thinks.

987
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,508
I am worried about what I think.

988
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:47,256
And what is it that you think?

989
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:49,290
That what if this was
a terrible mistake

990
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,059
and it doesn't work out

991
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:53,261
and I look like a fool?

992
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,831
Okay.

993
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,068
I know I'm not the therapist here,

994
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,403
but isn't that the risk
of any relationship?

995
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:08,142
I'm scared, Harvey.

996
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,444
Me too.

997
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,148
What do you say we both
be scared together?

998
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:25,060
Can I help you?

999
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,561
Yeah.

1000
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,663
My name is Mike Ross.

1001
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,431
I would say nice to meet you,

1002
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,567
but I'm pretty sure you
don't feel the same way.

1003
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,970
Not particularly.

1004
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:36,337
What's this?

1005
00:39:36,372 --> 00:39:38,640
My next 15 potential lawsuits.

1006
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:41,149
I just want to make sure you
don't have any conflicts with any of these.

1007
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:44,146
Maybe your client's grandmother
shops at the supermarket

1008
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:45,947
across the street from number 12.

1009
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,282
I'll take a look.

1010
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,118
Good, 'cause just to be clear,

1011
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,419
if I'd known there was a conflict,

1012
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,321
I never would've taken the case.

1013
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,591
I appreciate you dropping it.

1014
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,459
I was bulldozed into dropping it,

1015
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,195
just like I was bulldozed
into signing this.

1016
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,133
Now, I can live with both those things,

1017
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,235
but I never want to get caught
in this situation again.

1018
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,171
What's so funny?

1019
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:13,597
I just told my client
the same damn thing.

1020
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:15,209
Bullshit.

1021
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:16,878
You think this makes me look good?

1022
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:21,315
Well then I guess we're
in the same boat after all.

1023
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,218
It's nice to meet you, Mike.

1024
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,122
Welcome to Pearson Specter Litt.

1025
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:32,593
You said I needed a strategy
for when it happened.

1026
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:34,696
Well, I used your strategy,
and I got over it,

1027
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,032
but it didn't fix a goddamn thing!

1028
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,069
Louis, calm down. I'm here for you.

1029
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,038
No, you're not! You're
never there for me.

1030
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,372
You're always against me.

1031
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,340
I did what you said,

1032
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:48,409
and this time, it's not my fault.

1033
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:51,512
And I don't give a shit what you think.

1034
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:54,015
I'm not the horrible person
you always say I am.

1035
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,017
Louis, I don't think
you're a horrible person.

1036
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,019
I think you're a wonderful person.

1037
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,554
And if I haven't made that clear to you,

1038
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,289
I am very sorry.

1039
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,391
Well, you can be sorry
all you want, Harvey.

1040
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:05,393
- Louis?
- But you are wrong about me.

1041
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:08,229
I'm not a worthless piece of shit.

1042
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:09,798
You failed me.

1043
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,982
And you were wrong.

1044
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,535
You were wrong!
