1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,678
When you work here, you
don't think about home

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:05,940
- and families and babies.
- That's not fair.

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,553
He couldn't have known he was
gonna have a baby a year...

4
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:08,804
Let me tell you something, Stephanie.

5
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,077
Maybe you don't know how babies are made,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,759
because when people are trying,
they know they're trying!

7
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,279
And just because no one
ever wants to try with you

8
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,406
doesn't give you the right

9
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:18,514
to tell me how to run my associates!

10
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:21,751
I got an offer for more money
than I'll see my whole life,

11
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:24,342
and you want me to turn
it down based on a feeling

12
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:26,280
that whatever happened to
Chris happened to other people?

13
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,770
- You're dating your therapist.
- I don't need a lecture from you, Louis.

14
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:30,965
Does Donna have any idea
about the two of you?

15
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,523
No, she doesn't,

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,499
and for right now, I'd
like to keep it that way.

17
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:36,967
Harvey, is there something
that you're not telling me?

18
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,734
'Cause it seems like you've
been different lately.

19
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,094
We win this, you're gonna be Andy Dufresne

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,605
sitting on a beach in Mexico

21
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,274
with a bank account full of cash.

22
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,809
I already make a nice living in here.

23
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,998
I was thinking maybe some of that
money might go to your daughter.

24
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,576
I wasn't lying about
working a case with Oliver.

25
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,901
I just didn't tell you which one.

26
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,428
- The prison one?
- Yeah.

27
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,322
- This is a fireable offense.
- Harvey isn't gonna fire me.

28
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:59,275
Yeah, but maybe he should.
What is your word worth?

29
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,457
The way things are going, it's
not gonna be worth very much.

Hey.

33
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,639
How long have you been up?

34
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:19,709
A while.

35
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:22,546
I've been thinking about what
you said to me last night.

36
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,861
Mike, I didn't mean to be so harsh.

37
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:28,017
No, you were right.

38
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,222
My word does mean everything to me...

39
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,925
which is why I'm gonna keep helping Oliver.

40
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,527
What?

41
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,928
When I gave my word to Harvey, I meant it.

42
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,231
But before that, I gave
my word to Oscar Reyes.

43
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:43,634
And I'm sorry, but I-I can't back out now.

44
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,802
Okay. [sighs]

45
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,538
So you're just gonna live your
life keeping secrets again?

46
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,207
- This isn't like that.
- How is it not like that?

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,527
You're keeping this from Harvey.

48
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:54,116
And Harvey kept things from Jessica.

49
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,741
Look at how that turned out.

50
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,849
I tell Harvey now, and it's
the same as if he catches me.

51
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:00,850
The case gets tossed, and all of the people

52
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:03,378
we're trying to help keep getting abused.

53
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,753
It's the same as before.

54
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,691
No, Rachel, this is not the
same as when I was a fraud.

55
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:09,897
And I'll tell you something else...

56
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,894
I used to have trouble sleeping at night,

57
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,443
but I sleep like a baby now

58
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,865
because I am helping these people.

59
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:19,703
I'm sorry, but that's
the word that I'm keeping.

60
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,077
Good morning.

61
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:28,963
Hey. Did you sleep well?

62
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,336
If you consider eight hours
of bliss sleeping well,

63
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,885
then, yes, I slept very well.

64
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,887
But now I have to go.

65
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,600
- Wait.
- Harvey, I have patients.

66
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,691
I know, but I wanted to get
your opinion on something.

67
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,962
What have you done this time?

68
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:49,899
I haven't told Donna we're
seeing each other yet.

69
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,376
Why not?

70
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,002
Come on, you know my history with her.

71
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,318
We're working together.
I just promoted her.

72
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,307
That's more an excuse
than a reason, isn't it?

73
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,345
I don't want to create a
problem when there isn't one.

74
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,706
And who says there has to be one?

75
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:01,709
There doesn't have to be one, but...

76
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:05,523
Harvey, first of all, you
may be underestimating her.

77
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,316
- I mean, Donna's a big girl.
- Paula...

78
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,113
And second of all, if I'm wrong
and you're not underestimating her,

79
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,804
then you're only gonna cause both of you

80
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,232
a lot more trouble down
the road when she finds out.

81
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:17,294
'Cause, Harvey, she is gonna find out.

82
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,597
So you're telling me to tell her?

83
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,865
You already know what you need to do.

84
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:27,303
You just asked me because sometimes
we need to hear it from someone else.

Down payment? I don't think so.

- Yeah, absolutely.

139
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,724
about taking time off,
I mean, I don't even know

to swear to that in court?

- What? Why?
- No reason.

Truth is, my recollection
is exactly the same as yours.

off, and I gave it to you.

See, I even wrote it in my diary.

150
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,120
"Gave Brian two days
off. Felt good about it."

157
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,228
Thanks for seeing us on such
short notice, Ms. Randolph.

158
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,462
I have to say, when I
heard the name Frank Gallo,

159
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,133
my interest was piqued. What's this about?

160
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,656
We're representing a class of prisoners

161
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,118
suing Reform Corporation
for abusive practices.

162
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:48,351
We're here to confirm that
Frank Gallo came to see you

163
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:51,505
seven years ago and admitted to
being involved in a conspiracy.

164
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,741
Yeah, he came to me
offering to be an informant

165
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,379
in exchange for protection from
what was going on in Lambert.

166
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,314
And did you believe what he told you?

167
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:00,084
Of course I believed him. He was beaten up,

168
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:02,162
and he'd been in the infirmary
for two goddamn weeks.

169
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,265
Well, if you believed him, why the
hell didn't you pursue the case?

170
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,726
I did pursue it. I ran it up the flagpole,

171
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:08,795
and it came back down
like a concrete block.

172
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,399
No one gives a shit about prisoners
or the way they're treated.

173
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,796
So, instead, he offered to
inform on his fellow inmates,

174
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,111
and then he used that to
get himself transferred.

175
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:18,802
Exactly. Now, if you don't mind.

176
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,803
Well, Danielle, in fact, I do mind.

177
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,539
You see, I do give a shit
about how prisoners are treated,

178
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:26,366
which means you are gonna tell the court

179
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,452
exactly what you just told us.

Well, then this is
gonna go one of two ways.

You give us your records,
and we submit them quietly...

- No, it's fine.

Because, you know, I'm not

a secret from Donna...

At least part of her does,

it and doesn't want it to stop.

happening to someone else,

No money, no justice, no healing.

Oscar, I'm gonna make it right.

I'll believe that when I see it!

Harvey, if this is about earlier today,

934
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:49,176
I want to thank you for backing me.

935
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,578
It is about earlier today, Alex,

936
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:54,348
but I'm not here for you to thank me.

What are you talking about?

I got to thinking about what Mike said,

939
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,454
and he was right.

this isn't just about you
protecting your client's interests.

943
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:11,232
It's about you protecting yourself.

944
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:16,237
So why don't you tell me
what's really going on here?
