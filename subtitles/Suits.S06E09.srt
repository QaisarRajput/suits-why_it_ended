I put Gallo away
for racketeering.

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:06,209
But that's not what
he really did.

5
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,113
We had him for conspiracy
to commit murder,

6
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:11,648

that he did it

8

out of the chain of custody
for 20 minutes.

9
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,687

That's what I've been saying!

Well, you could've
asked for postponement

16
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,631

except for one thing:

17
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,311
when I pressed her as to what
the two of them were doing

18
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:31,479
at the time of those murders,

19
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,169

were both on meth.

Hey, Counselor.

160
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,453
You didn't forget about me,
did you?

161
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,355
Your hearing's

00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,717
What they found is
nothing but hearsay.

316
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,952
What is he talking about?

317
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,088
He's talking about the fact
that our eyewitness

318
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,355
died three years ago,

319
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,757
and Mr. Bailey's
original attorney

320
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,525
is going to testify
on her behalf

321
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,595
under the Turner v. Michigan
exception to the hearsay rule.

322
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,064
That exception involved
a written statement.

323
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,944
It is a written statement,
and we have it right here.

324
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,468
That is not
a written statement.

325
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,003
That is a bullshit affidavit she
cobbled together this morning.

326
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,505
What did you just
accuse her of?

327
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,274
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I
find it decidedly convenient

328
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,976
that they don't have
the witness statement

329
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,046
written down on a notebook
or a scrap of paper

330
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,848
from the same decade
that it happened.

331
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,016
Well, we happen to find it
decidedly inconvenient.

332
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,052
And Georgina Casey didn't
write it down at the time

333
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,620
because she didn't do
an adequate job

334
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,322
representing her client.

335
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,258
Are you now saying that this
case needs to be reopened

336
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,161
based on Leonard Bailey having
inadequate representation?

337
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,263
Because that is a serious
allegation to make

338
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,431
about a fellow attorney.

339
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,765
That wasn't our plan.

340
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,068
But if that's what it takes
to give this man a chance

341
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,503
to prove his innocence,

342
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,338
then it sure as hell
is our plan now.

343
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,772
This is ridiculous.

344
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,242
It may sound ridiculous,
but if they were able to get

345
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,645
a successful attorney to admit
to a huge blunder,

346
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,025

should be reopened after all.

- No.
- Well, it's time you did.

A man gets a flat tire
on a country road.

390
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,143
He sees a house in the distance.

391
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,689
He walks up to the house,
and along the way,

392
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,947
he starts thinking, "What if
they don't have a jack?

393
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,181
"What if they have a jack,

394
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,761
"but they want to charge me
for it, and if they do,

395
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:56,862
"how much would they charge?

396
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:59,086
$100, $200, $1,000?"

397
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,654
- That's bullshit.
- Exactly.

398
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,100
So by the time the man
gets to the house,

399
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,602
rings the bell, and they
answer the door,

400
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:04,826
he tells them, "You know what?

401
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,094
Keep your goddamn jack."

402
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,129
- That's brilliant.
- So you get my point.

403
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,864
No.

404
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,701
Louis, you have no idea
what's going on in Tara's mind,

405
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:16,570
so the best thing you can do
is trust her.

Nothing.

420
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,514
It's not nothing.
You were threatening him.

421

You ever do it again
without my say so,

00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,251
you'll regret the day
you met me.

Don't worry about it, kid.
I got your back.

I wouldn't be finding out
about it from him.

430

He just did that because
you told him to,

If I could go back
and change what I did,

472
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,666
I would, but I can't.

473
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:02,136
What I can do is swear to you

474

that I will never go back
to being that person again.

475

You crossed the line when
you took Jill's money.

No, Mike, I didn't,

Your deal is gone.

If there are no
other statements--

479

- Cameron Dennis.

481

I was the district attorney at
the time of Mr. Gallo's trial.

482
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,159
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dennis
is about to play a tape

483
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,360
from the original trial.

484
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,095
It wasn't admissible then,

485
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,429
and it's not admissible now.

486
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,398
No, Harvey, I'm going
to read the transcript

487
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:35,068
of your own words from
Mr. Gallo's sentencing hearing.

488
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,404
"Frank Gallo is the scum
of the Earth.

489
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:40,374
"He's a sociopath
who has no remorse

490
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,543
"for the things he's done,
and he is an animal

491
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:45,445
who deserves to be locked up for
the rest of his miserable life."

492
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,247
I gave you immunity
for crimes you committed

493
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:48,715
before you got caught.

494
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:51,062
But your plea agreement says
you'll never practice law again

495
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,152
without a license.

496
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,153
You've been practicing
law in here,

497
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,354
which means that's a crime

498
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,823
that happened after
you got caught.

499
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,024
Bullshit.

500
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,992
Kevin and Jill both know
that I'm not a lawyer.

501
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,627
You know that
and I know that,

502
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:02,563
but if you fight it,
I will argue it in court

503
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:03,897
for the next two years.

504
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,243
And if you don't
drop this thing, you'll be lucky

505
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,545
if they let you out a day before

506
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,102
you were supposed
to get out anyway.

507
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,672
Mr. Chairman,
I'm telling you,

508
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:13,574
Frank Gallo has changed.

509
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,976
And I'm telling the board
he hasn't changed.

510
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,189
He's just trying
to blackmail you.

511
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,412
That's a lie.

512
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,180
Then take the stand
and swear it's not true.

513
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:21,615
That's enough.

514
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,351
Mr. Specter, this is a parole
hearing, not a court of law,

515
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,131
but if there's any truth
to what he's saying,

516
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,689
we need to know.

517
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:30,090
It's not true.

518
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,259
Unfortunately, this body
doesn't have the authority

519
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:33,738
to swear you in,
but I'm going to make sure

520
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,363
that we will tomorrow.

521
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,809
I'd like you to think
long and hard about

522
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,032
what you're gonna say then,

523
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:40,734
because you'll be
saying it under oath.

524
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,465
Mike, I need to tell you
what just happened.

525
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,200
I need to tell you
what happened first.

526
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,042
Abuse of power?
Are you nuts?

527
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,277
It's the only play I have.

528
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,723
Your only play is
to walk out of here

529
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:04,924
when your release comes through,

530
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,681
not threaten the guy
who made that happen.

531
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:07,882
Listen to me.

532
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,484
Cahill is seizing
their personal assets.

533
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,297
Yeah, I don't care if he
takes their house apart

534
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,854
brick by brick.

535
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,467
Harvey, Kevin wouldn't even
be in here in the first place

536
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,757
if it weren't for Cahill.

537
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,637
No, Mike, Kevin wouldn't
be here if he had chosen

538
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,661
to roll over on Sutter
in the first place.

539
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:20,873
And it's a good thing he didn't,

540
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:22,342
because you'd be stuck in here
with Gallo

for the next two years.

542
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,532
I don't care about Gallo.

543
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,468
Well, you should,
because he's not out yet,

544
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,003
and if it's up
to Cameron Dennis,

545
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:29,704
he's not getting out.

546
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,341
What?

547
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,044
Cameron got wind that I'm
trying to get Gallo parole.

548
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,746
And now I got to think
of something

549
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,247
or perjure myself tomorrow,

550
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,949
or he's gonna end up
right back in here.

551
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:43,752
Well, that's even more reason
why we can't leave Kevin behind.

552
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,587
If Gallo doesn't get out
and I do,

553
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,423
the first person he's gonna
go after is Kevin.

And I didn't sign on
to get someone killed.

555
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,061
No, you signed on
to get yourself out.

556
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,963
Now if you don't drop this suit,

Five more years for a crime

agency in the state.

And what makes you think
just because you follow him,

00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,131
it's gonna stop him
from committing crimes?

so that he could
get into my cell,

to be my roommate.

And after getting
me to trust him,

773

he told me that he had been
