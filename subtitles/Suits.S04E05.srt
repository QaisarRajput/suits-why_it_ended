It's...
- Sean cahill.

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,073
- Welcome to the new s.E.C.

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,608
We target law firms.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,510
- Mr. Forstman.
- No.

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,413
- You'll miss the opportunity
to get back at harvey specter.

7
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,781
- You've got my 230 mil.

8
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:19,284
Once the deal closes,
you cut sidwell out.

9
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,687
- What happened to "you think
I'm staying if you leave"?

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,755
- Yeah, that was before I knew

11
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,289
You were gonna
screw over sidwell.

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,724
- Forstman doesn't throw
money around

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,326
Without getting something
in return.

14
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:31,196
- So we're just gonna go
back and forth trading favors?

15
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,731
- Are you my lawyer or not?

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,335
Seriously, rachel, I couldn't
have done it without you.

17
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,171

- Mike?

20
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,196
- Did you turn off my alarm?
- I did.

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,497
- It's after 9:00.

22
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,498
I have been sleeping for...

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,599
- Almost six hours.

24
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,768
And the truth is, you need more.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,203
- Why would you do that?

26
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,638
- Rachel, you've been
running back and forth

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,373
Between school and the firm
like a maniac.

28

I don't even remember
the last time

29
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:18,210
- It doesn't give you
the right to do that.

30
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,578
Plus, harvey's gonna kill me.
- He'll get over it.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,746
- And I've got three briefs
to write,

32
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,748
Plus a paper for torts

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,116
And a contracts exam tomorrow.

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,518
I don't have the luxury
to sleep in.

35
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,387
- Then you need to ask harvey
for a day off this week.

36
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,290
- Did he ever give you time off
because you were overworked?

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,827
- No, he didn't.
- Exactly.

38
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,398
I don't want to be
any different.

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,633
- Mr. Jamieson,
you are hereby remanded

To the federal penitentiary

[gavel bangs]

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,212
- You might want to call me
about an appeal.

43
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,815
The prosecutor has a reputation
for bending the rules.

44
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,418
- You must be
the infamous harvey specter.

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,454
- And you must be the chump
eric woodall ordered

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,655
To come after me.

47
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,224
- Chump's my name
on my mother's side.

48
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,893
- And I prefer you stop

To get my clients to turn on me.

50
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,630
- I'm sorry, I'm not in
the manufacturing business.

51
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,432
I'm just a humble civil servant.

52
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,766
And if you're as clean
as you say you are,

53
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,468
Your clients won't have anything
to give us.

54
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,303
- Unless you bully them
into making things up.

55
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,872
- Oh, see, now I think
you've got us confused,

56
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,507
Because that sounds like
something that you might do.

57
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,176
- The point is, sean,
you had a secret little plan,

58
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,345
And I've taken away
your element of surprise.

59
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,312
- Have you?

60
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,347
You may know I'm coming,

61
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,382
But do you know where or when?

62
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,185
See, while you're battening down
the hatches at b-4,

63
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,686
I might be at d-12 or h-3,

64
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,923
And before you know it,
I have sunk your battleship.

65
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,491
- That's a cute game.

00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,794
I was more of a rock 'em
sock 'em robots guy.

67
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,863
- So you think you can knock
my block off, harvey?

68
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,233
- I know I can, because I had
eric woodall fired.

69
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,369
So stay the hell away
from my clients,

70
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,672
Or I'll pave
the same career path for you.

71
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,708
- Okay, your hands weren't full
with eric.

72
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,345
They will be full with me.

Harv.

00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,922
- You want to talk about it?

75
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:14,893
- That 10,000-pound weight
on your shoulders.

76
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,430
What are you gonna feel like
when you cut sidwell out?

77
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,500
- If I cut him out.

78
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,768
- What are you talking about?

79
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,236
- I've been thinking about it.

80
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,773
I haven't actually
taken forstman's money yet.

81
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,442
If I can get harvey
to back off before I do,

82
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,344
Then I might not even need it.

83
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,646
- You want to use the idea
of forstman's money

84
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,681
To cut a deal.

85
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,916
But, mike, they have money too.

86
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,385
- Yeah, which they can't spend
until their t.R.O. Expires.

87
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,254
- Yeah, but that's next week,
and it's not like

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,538

For more than 4%
of their holdings

92

In any one industry.

93
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,978
- They have to sell
a block of something.

94
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,713
But how do you know
it's gonna be gillie industries?

95
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,415
- Because I did the math.
That's what I would do.

96
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,817
- You think harvey
will go for it?

97
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,820
- There's only one way
to find out.

- Hey, I don't have
any cash on me,

That's okay.

I would return the favor.

a little loan is gonna stop me,

I didn't teach you much.

No deal.

He's got some kind of gun

00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,000
- He tried to buy us off.
- And you turned him down.

157
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,802
- Yes, which is why
I'm going to see malone.

158
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,771
- No, you're not.
- Jessica, we have to...

159
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,072
- I'm not saying we don't.

160
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,475
I'm saying I'm going to be
the one to do it.

161
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,610
- You know
he's not gonna like it.

162
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,078
- He doesn't have to like it.

163
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,447
He has to do it.

164
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,551
- Therefore, prepare thee
to cut off the flesh.

165
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,522
Shed thou no blood,
nor cut thou less nor more.

166
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,425
But just a pound of flesh if...

167
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,528
Louis, how long have you been
standing there?

168
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,129
- Long enough
to become part of you.

169
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,664
- Okay, you know what?

170
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,032
I don't have time
for you to be creepy.

171
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,667
- So does this mean
you're doing theater again?

172
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,436
- Yes, I am playing portia
in<i> merchant of venice.</i>

173
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,172
- Holy sh..., donna,
that is a meaty part.

174
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,675
- Yeah, it's 588 lines,
which I have yet to memorize.

175
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,677
- Wait.

176
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,678
So you're not off book?

177
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,012
- Louis, if I were off book,

178
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,580
Would I be pacing around
the copy room

179
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,582
With a script in my hand?

180
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,649
- All right, just calm down.

181
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,651
No need to panic.

182
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,717
When do you open?
- Tonight.

183
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,019
- Tonight,
and you're not off book?

184
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,220
What the hell's wrong with you,
donna?

185
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,521
- Okay, this isn't helping.
- I'm sorry.

186
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,622
I didn't mean to be...
- I knew it.

187
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,725
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
just relax, okay?

188
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,960
I don't care
if it takes all day.

189
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,497
We are gonna memorize
these lines together.

190
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,732
- Thank you, louis.
- No need.

191
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,601
For one canst choke
on the joy of life

192
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,102
Without thy mouth full.

193
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,704
- Is that the bard?

194
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,607
And roughly translated,
it means,

Milady.

197
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,720
- I take it it didn't go well.

198
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,790
- Because I know you,
and you don't have your usual

"I'm super cool mike ross" face.

200
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,827
- If you knew me that well,

201
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,097
You'd know I'm not in the mood.

202
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,902
And I don't appreciate
being treated like I am.

203
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,904
- I know.

204
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,072
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,740
- So what did harvey say?

206
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,208
- It's not what he said.
It's what he did.

207
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,511
He knew what I was trying to do,

208
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,145
And he called my bluff
right there.

209
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,248
- He didn't even share the offer
with logan?

210
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,250
- No, he didn't.

211
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,550
- But you said he had to.

212
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,218
- You want me to sue him
for that?

213
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,520
- So what are you gonna do?

214
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,587
- You know what I'm gonna do.

215
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,889
- Mike.
- I don't want to hear it.

216
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:48,827
I just want to make sure you've
exhausted all your options.

217
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,262
- I have.
- Then maybe you can...

218
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,797
- Amy, the second I bid
on that block of shares,

219
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,232
I've already taken
forstman's money.

I'll tell him.

223
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,875
- Sidwell?

224
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,311
- He wants to see you.

225
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,621
- You look good.

226
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,557
- This isn't a social call.

00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,158
- All right, I take it back.

A huge block
of gillie industries,

230
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,963
And I need you to find
a creative way

231
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,298
To buy them for logan sanders.

232
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,733
- If I'm not mistaken,
logan sanders has a t.R.O.

233
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,269
That actually prohibits him from
buying any additional shares.

234
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,704
- Which is why
you're going to set up a trust

235
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,805
For us to buy it for him.

236
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,173
- That's called parking,
jessica.

237
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,341
- I know what it's called.

238
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,976
- Then maybe you also know
it's illegal.

239
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,778
- I know it can be illegal,

240
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,147
And I need you to figure out
a way to make it questionable.

241
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,915
- And here I thought
you came in here

242
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,051
To tell me how much fun
last night was.

243
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,953
- Oh, speaking of last night,

244
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,055
You said you blamed yourself

245
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,625
For helping cahill
drop those cases.

246
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,827
So here's your chance
to make up for it.

247
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,863
A moment of self-reflection
around you.

248
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,299
- I'm not using this
as ammunition.

249
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,068
I am using it as motivation.

250
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,971
So figure out a way
to set up the trust,

251
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,072
And do it quickly,

252
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,709
Because we're running
out of time.

253

255
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,156
I want to show you something.

- Lionsdale electronics,
3 million shares,

Bought out by management.

258
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,136
- My first lbo.
I was right out of school.

259
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,739
All I wanted was that first
tombstone because it meant...

260
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:45,076
- Your first deal.
- Broke my cherry.

261
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,078
- Must have been nice.

262
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,214
- It was.

263
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,349
But you know what the difference
between you and me is?

264
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,417
I was just an analyst.

265
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,818
I mean, sure,
I did all the work,

266
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,953
But I didn't do any of the work.

267
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,388
Know what I mean?

00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,989
- Jonathan.
- Don't be modest.

269
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,290
I know I've been on your case,

270
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,394
But the truth is,
you made this all happen.

271
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,396
- I haven't made
anything happen yet.

272
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,398

And there's a rule against
giving out tombstones too early.

supposed to jinx it.

275
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,273
- But there's no rule
against this.

- Harvey,
can I help you with something?

286
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,062
- Yes, you can help
by telling me

287
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,430
How much longer it's gonna take

For you to find me a way
to bid on that stock.

00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,868
- It's going to take
as long as it takes.

290
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,837
- Well, it better not be
more than a day,

291
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,405
Or I won't need it at all.

from the horse's mouth.

293
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,811

you want me to break the law,

00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,413
At least have the balls
to ask me yourself.

295

First off, jessica insisted
on asking you herself,

296
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,186
And I agreed with her,
because we're on the same page.

297

And nobody's asking you
to break the law.

We're telling you
to sidestep it.

I signed on for.

- The job you signed on for

301
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,428
Is the job we tell you
you signed on for.

And you know it.

It's because we figure out a way

So stop questioning my integrity

00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,552
- Time's up.

313
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,354
- Could I get a day or two off?

314
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,455
- A day or two?

315
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,457
- A day.

316
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,091
I just need one day away.

317
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,359
- Are you sure
that's all you need?

318
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,862
- Would you also like me
to make your bed?

319
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:21,065
- Maybe I can triple your salary
while we're at it.

320
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:25,170
- No, really, what can I do
to make your life easier?

321
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,506
I have been juggling work
and school for months now,

322
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,074
And I-I haven't asked
for any special treatment.

323
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,810
- You're asking now.

324
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,278
- I'm not asking for time off

325
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,479
To go to the hamptons.

326
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,314
This is law school
I'm talking about.

327
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,950
You didn't say anything
about law school.

328
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,984
- Well, it's for law school.

329
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,553
- Well, this is your law school.

330
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,922
This, right here.

331
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,523
And by the way,
we're paying you for it.

332
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,192
- I know, and I'm grateful.

333
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,260
- If you're grateful,
then you'll stop complaining

334
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,895
About how much work
you have to do,

335
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,564
And you'll figure out
how to best manage your time,

336
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,400
But as far as getting time off,
that's not gonna happen

337
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,901
If you still plan on
working for me.

338
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,570
Now, you still need
a day or two off?

339
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,206
- No, I can manage.

340
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,082
- Thou shalt have nothing
but the forfeiture

341
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,585
To be so taken
at thy peril, jew.

342
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,553
- Why, then, let the devil
give him good of it.

343
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:19,390
I'll stay no longer question.

344
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,859
Come on, let's go.
This be-eth awesome.

345
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,026
- Where's your script?

346
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,494
- I don't need a script.
I'm off book.

347
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,296
- How can you be off book?
You're not even in the play.

348
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,498
- Because I know
all of willy's work by heart.

349
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,902
- All 37 plays?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:35,406
- For to be wise and love
exceeds man's might.

351
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:39,277
- Vengeance is in my heart,
death in my hand.

352
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,046
Blood and revenge
are hammering in my head.

353
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,048
What... what's the matter?

354
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,416
- Are you kidding me?

355
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,186
You have every word this man's
ever written memorized,

356
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,354
And I'm on
in an hour and a half,

357
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,889
And I'm gonna
make a fool of myself.

358
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,257
- Donna, forget
about my extraordinary gift

359
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,491
And focus on yourself.

360
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,193
We have done this whole play.

361
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,161
You know your part.
It will be fine.

362
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,198
- It's not gonna be fine.
- Donna.

363
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,933
- I haven't been on the stage
in years.

364
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,201
- So you're nervous.

365
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,904
All great performers
get nervous.

366
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,305
It brings out the genius.

367
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,174
- What if I'm not genius?
What if I'm not even good?

368
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,514
I was pretty damn good, louis.

369
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,484
I was.

370
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,219
But I knew the odds
of somebody making it

371
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:25,456
Were close to zero
no matter how good they were.

372
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,659
My father lost our money
when I was 13,

373
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,362
And I-I found out
what it was like to struggle,

374
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:36,534
So instead of pursuing my dream,

375
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,103
I chose this...

376
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,173
And that let me pretend

377
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,410
That maybe I was good enough
to make it.

378
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,549
But what if I wasn't?

379
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,717
- Mm-mm, all right, look,

380
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,185
I'm gonna tell you
something about myself

381
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,221
That I never told anyone.

382
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,691
I have stage fright.

383
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,592
Got it when I was
in third grade.

384
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,595
Let it get the best of me.

385
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,532
I never got over it.

386
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,135
And I cannot let you
make the same mistake.

387
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,139
- But...
- Look at me.

388
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,710
Donna victoria paulsen,

389
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,746
You have never been
more beautiful

390
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:25,149
And talented

391
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,320
And perfect than you are
at this very moment.

392
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,323
Your time is now.

393
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,226
And you're gonna kill it.

394
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,228
- Thank you, louis.

395
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,263
- No.

396
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,367
Thank you.

397
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,303
- My middle name is roberta.

398
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,274
- I'm so sorry for that.

399
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,048
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,218
- Were you working late?

401
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,687
- You really have to ask?

402
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,392
- Thought maybe it would be nice
for us to lie down a little bit.

403
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,262
Together.

404
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:16,100
But if I lie down,
I probably won't get back up.

405
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,574
- I know you don't want
to hear this,

406
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,044
But I was thinking about it,

407
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,614
And harvey did kind of
give me special treatment.

408
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,683
- Mike.
- He let me skip law school.

409
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,755
- Yeah.

410
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:42,226
Maybe if you just find
the right time to ask, you know.

411
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:46,330
- I did, and he bit my head off.

412
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,501
So please just let it go.

413
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,071
Okay?
- Okay.

414
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,673
Just wish all this harvey
and logan bullsh...

415
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,142
Would be over.

416
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,612
- Yeah, me too.

417
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,817
We can get out of town
for a weekend.

418
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,486
- I would love that.

419
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,239
- I've checked
with everyone I know.

420
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,342
- Me too, which is exactly
why I'm worried.

421
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,812
If I have to look over
my shoulder every 15 seconds,

422
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,549
- Okay, but it doesn't mean
you stop looking altogether.

423
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,885
[knocking]
- Hey, do you have a minute?

424
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,220
- Did you set up that trust?

425
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,355
- No.
- In that case, we don't.

426
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,490
- I did something better.

427
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,757
- We're listening.

428
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,127
- One of the biggest red flags
at the s.E.C.

429
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,762
Is a stock purchase with money
kept in trust for clients.

430
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,764
- We've gone over this.

431
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,799
- Let him finish.

432
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,501
- On the other hand,

433
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,137
There's nothing unusual
about a retainer.

434
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,705
- A retainer?

435
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:04,142
This takeover is
a massive undertaking, right?

436
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,776
Now, I don't know how you've
structured logan's payments,

437
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,746
But I think it's time he pay
this firm a hefty fee up front

438
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,616
And something on the order
of $20 million.

439
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,719
- And we use $20 million of
our own money to buy that stock.

440
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,220
- There's nothing
that prohibits us

441
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,922
From investing as a firm.

442
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,690
- And when the bulk
of our legal work is done,

443
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,259
Turns out
he has money coming back.

444
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,394
- We may just end up
giving him the shares

445
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,929
Instead of his unused retainer.

446
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,199
Or even discuss
with logan sanders in advance.

447
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,567
- And that makes it legal?

448
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,370
- No.

449
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,505
It makes it questionable,

450
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,374
Because they still might
figure out what we did

451
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,376
And make a case.

452
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,643
- We?

453
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,945
- You tell me, harvey.

454
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,181
Am I on the team now?

455
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,317
A little bit of a dickhead
about this whole thing,

456
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,454
So I'd say yes.

457
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,633
- Louis?

458
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,701
Do you have a minute?

459
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,969
- Oh, no.

460
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,470
It could not have been that bad.

461
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,772
- Oh, it wasn't.

462
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,275
It was amazing.

463
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,977
I mean,
it was like riding a bike.

464
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,245
I got two standing os,

465
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,713
And I got you to thank for it.

466
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,915
- Well, that's great.

467
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:22,653
Fell down a flight of stairs,
and broke his ankle,

468
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,323
Which means the show
won't go on.

469
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,758
- No, no, no,
the show must go on.

470
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,729
- Well, the show can go on.

471
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,334
- No.
- Louis.

472
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,769
Come on, you're the only one
who can do it.

473
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,373
- No, I can't.

474
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,775
I wanted to be a molar.

475
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,245
But that teacher's pet,
dorothy mchale, got the part,

476
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,914
So I was forced to be plaque.

477
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,650
Had to wear this ridiculous
flesh-colored unitard

478
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,518
And drape myself
over my classmates,

479
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,388
And every parent in the audience
laughed at me.

480
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,690
- And then the next year,
I got a bigger part.

481
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,727
Walked right out onstage.

482
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,330
Tommy gallup screams out,
"plaque man!"

483
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,333
Once again,
everyone laughs at me.

484
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:13,871
So right then and there,
middle of the stage, I...

485
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:22,380
I peed my pants.

486
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,848
So I ran right off the stage,

487
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,383
Never went back,

488
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,885
And I am not going back again.

489
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,788
- Louis.

490
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,392
A part like this doesn't
come around very often.

491
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,794
You gave me a gift,
and I killed it because of you.

492
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,928
- Donna, please.

493
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,798
- I'm not a lawyer, louis.

494
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,368
This is my chance to shine.

495
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,373
But I'm about to lose
two more glorious nights.

496
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,744
I've never asked anyone
for anything like this,

497
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,580
But there's no other choice.

498
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,350
Please do this for me.

499
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,089
Please.

500
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,592
- You want me to sell
directly to you?

501
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,594
- I don't want you to.

502
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,795
You're going to.

503
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,363
- Why would I do that?

504
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,531
- Because I'm the only one

505
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,965
Who's gonna buy your block
at a premium,

506
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,768
Instead of you flooding
the market with shares

507
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,768
And ending up
getting a discount.

508
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,670
- That's funny.

509
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,906
That's exactly what someone else
just told me an hour ago.

510
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,542
- And now I'll tell you
what I told him.

511
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,843
I'll shut everyone else out,

512
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,747
But you two are gonna
have to go head-to-head.

513
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,949
- You're talking
about a dark pool bidding war.

514
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,050
- That's no different

515
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,518
Than what you were
talking about.

516
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,454
You just wanted to be
the only one bidding.

517
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,556
Thanks for the scampi,
mr. Ross.

518
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,124
It was delicious.

519
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,493
I'll be in touch
with the details.

520
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,529
- Who's the other entity?

521
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,698
- If you can't figure that out
for yourself,

522
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,103
To come out on top
of this whole thing.

523
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,652
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

524
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:09,887
- I think I'm washing my hands,

525
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,056
Which I'd like to do
without you bothering me

526
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,824
About whatever bullsh...
you're here for.

527
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,059
- Bullsh...?

528
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,861
We'll see if the s.E.C.
Thinks it's bullsh...

529
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,496
That you're
buying stock illegally.

530
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,664
- You're throwing some
pretty big accusations around

531
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,033
- You think I didn't do
my homework?

532
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,702
The registered bidder
traces back

533
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:25,704
To a shell corporation

534
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,738
We used six times last year.

535
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,073
- We're allowed to play
the stock market

536
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,042
- You think
because you're using firm money,

537
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,044
That makes it legal?

538
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,578
- Damn right I do,

539
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,946
Because we have no plan
to do anything

540
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,948
Other than keep those shares
ourselves.

541
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,083
- Now who's talking bullsh...?

542
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,785
- What are you gonna do, mike?

543
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,186
You gonna run to the s.E.C.?

544
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,522
- You think I won't?

545
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,056
These aren't your daddy's tapes,
harvey.

546
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,491
These are the rules of the game.

547
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,593
- Then let me dial their number
for you,

548
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,961
Because if you report us,

549
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,696
They'll put a freeze
on this sale,

550
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,765
And by the time we get it
all straightened out,

551
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,500
My t.R.O. Will be expired,

552
00:23:56,502 --> 00:24:01,038
To where we're headed
this afternoon.

553
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,909
- You're a sore goddamn loser.

554
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,845
- I would be if I ever lost.

555
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,648
See you at 6:00.

556
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,218
- Guess what
piece of sh... lawyer

557
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Just got himself a seat
in the wexler pool.

558
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,555
- Mike, what are you doing here?

559
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,557
- What do you mean?

560
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,757
The sale's not until 6:00.

561
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,025
- Didn't you check
your messages?

562
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,027
- No. Why?

563
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,795
- Columbia university called.

564
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,065
Rachel was taken
to the hospital.

565
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,745
- Rachel zane.
- Sorry?

566
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:42,780
- You have a patient here,
rachel zane.

567
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:43,782
What room is she in?

568
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,716
- Miss zane is resting and can...

569
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,984
- What room is she in?

570
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,887
- As I was saying,
she can't have any visitors.

571
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:53,157
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
- Mike.

572
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,692
She's in 1024.

573
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:55,726
- You've seen her?

574
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,228
- It's locked.
- I don't care.

575
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,697
- What are you gonna do?
You gonna break the door down?

576
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,533
- Yeah, if I have to.
- I spoke to her doctors.

577
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,702
They said she fainted at school.
She's fine.

578
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,070
- If she fainted,
she's not fine.

579
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,806
- They said she's run down
and a little dehydrated

580
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:13,844
- Because she's sleeping,
and she needs it.

581
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,613
Mike, she's fine.

582
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:16,615
She's gonna be fine.

583
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,748
- What are you even doing here?

584
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,983
- I'm one
of her emergency contacts.

585
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,117
They called me.

586
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,519
- Yeah, I know, but...

587
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,686
- What's a heartless sh... head
like me

588
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,722
Doing in a place like this?

589
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,956
- Yeah, something like that.

590
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:30,928
If you ever worked hard enough
to pass out, but you never did.

591
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,297
- [scoffs]

592
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,967
- Look, there's a steakhouse
across the street.

593
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,570
Why don't you and I
go get something to eat?

594
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,205
What, you gonna break
the door down and wake her up?

595
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,840
- No, I'm gonna wait
outside of it

596
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,908
And be there when she does.

597
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,909
- Yeah, which won't happen

598
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:48,646
Because they sedated her
to make sure she got some sleep.

599
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,015
Come on, let's go get some food.

600
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,887
- Don't you need to be
at an auction?

601
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,789
- Right now, I don't want
to be at that sale

602
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,090
Any more than you do.

603
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,959
- You're saying you're willing
to postpone it?

604
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,795
- I'm saying I already did.
Come on.

605
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,702
- No, I'm telling you,
dr. Lipschitz,

606
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,004
This is like the whole
plaque incident all over again.

607
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:17,975
Yes, I have told you
about the plaque incident,

608
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,143
At least twice.

609
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,579
I've... no, that...
you know, it doesn't...

610
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,746
You know what, forget it.
That's not the point.

611
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,148
The point is,
is that I'm supposed to be

612
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,683
Leaving for the theater
in ten minutes,

613
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,151
And I am a complete wreck.

614
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,218
I have the worst case
of cottonmouth

615
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,255
In the history of...

616
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,290
What? No, you can talk
with cotton mouth.

617
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,292
That's frickin' lockjaw.

618
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,594
You know something, doc?

619
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,962
Sometimes I just think
that I've wasted

620
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,163
Every single Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday

621
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,932
For the last 14 years.

622
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,237
- You know,
this is the first time

623
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,006
We've ever had a steak dinner.

624
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,741
- I didn't know
you were keeping a tally.

625
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,944
- It's pretty easy to do
when the grand total is zero.

626
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,747
- I know.

627
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:57,948
I said I wanted to take you out

628
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,350
The night you told me
you were leaving.

629
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:03,120
- We never got around to it.

630
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,090
- I never got around to it.

631
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,995
- What's the real reason you
were at the hospital tonight?

632
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,031
- The truth?

633
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,799
Rachel asked me
for some time off,

634
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,401
And I all but spit in her face.

635
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,303
- So you felt guilty?

636
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,005
- Pretty much.

637
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,806
Plus,
I knew you needed something

638
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:28,712
But I can see this dinner
with me isn't working, so...

639
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,714
Here.

640
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,416
- Holy sh...

641
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,151
What is this?

642
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,020
- Louis is in a play.

643
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,254
- You wanted to cheer me up,

644
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,922
And you didn't
start the night with this?

645
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,692
- I wanted to save something
for dessert.

646
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:42,793
- Oh, my god, that's got to be
a codpiece, right?

647
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:46,697
I don't want to know if louis
is packing that kind of heat.

648
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,165
- You think I do?

649
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,266
- You're the one
who went mudding with him.

650
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,734
- It was covered in mud.

651
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,270
- How much mud?
- Stop.

652
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,839
- Why would I ask that?

653
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,342
- Oh, man.

654
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,448
I shouldn't be laughing at him.

655
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,952
He still hasn't forgiven me
for using sheila against him.

656
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,090
- Mike, you did
what you had to do.

657
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,725
- You don't think
that was crossing a line?

658
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,026
- It was way over the line.

659
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,095
But I got to tell you,
it was brilliant.

660
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:21,265
It was harsh,
but it was brilliant.

661
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,005
- You know, harvey,
I-I never told you.

662
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,841
What you did with gillie...

663
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,946
I know you had to do it.

664
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:39,383
- Like I said before,
we do what we need to do.

665
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,423
- Louis, you're almost up.

666
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,425
Oh, christ, you're sweating
more than nixon.

667
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,960
- I've gone through
four elizabethan collars

668
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,162
- Okay, just breathe.
You're gonna be fine.

669
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:55,499
- Louis, we are
in the middle of the play.

670
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,434
- You'll have to ad-lib.
Make something up.

671
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,337
Say that he went to israel.
- Oh, my god.

672
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,438
Wow!

673
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,442
I don't even know what...
you know what?

674
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,245
I never thought
you'd be so weak.

675
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,446
- Okay, why do you got to say
something hurtful right now?

676
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,781
- Oh, screw hurt!

677
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,183
Turn that into rage.
- Why would I do...

678
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,153
- You always turn hurt into
rage, you idiotic piece of sh...

679
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,387
It is what you do.

680
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,388
- Okay, now I'm mad at you.

681
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,291
Now, imagine you're in court.
- Court, how?

682
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,459
It's too hard with the curtain.
- Just do it, dipsh...

683
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:26,163
You happy now?
- No, I'm not happy, you idiot.

684
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,298
Now, you're in court,

685
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,335
And you're enraged,
and you are fit to kill.

686
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,171
Now, do you see
that audience out there?

687
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,206
That's your jury.
- They're a bunch of morons.

688
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,407
- Yeah, they're beneath you,
aren't they?

689
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,509
- They're beneath everybody.
- What else?

690
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,910
- They're a bunch
of civil servants

691
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:45,449
- I want to rip out their stupid
brains from their stupid heads.

692
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,917
- Exactly.

693
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,787
Now, get out there
and make your case.

694
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,790
And you were meant to play
plaque your whole life.

695
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,325
- 3,000 ducats.

696
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,064
- I'm gonna head back.

697
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,968
- Hey, tell rachel she should
take the day off tomorrow.

698
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,305
- Thanks for this, harvey.

699
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,073
- Excuse me.

700
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,141
Which one of you is franklin,

701
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,443
And which one of you is bash?

702
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,479
Did you boys have a nice date?

703
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,548
- Couldn't be better.
He even paid.

704
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,283
- Oh, I guess
he's flush with cash

705
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,819
In order to do
investment banking.

706
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,822
- No, but I know you.
Mike ross.

707
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,125
And he's using his position
to harass my clients

708
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,159
On behalf of eric woodall.

709
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:34,865
I decided to take your advice
and focus on you.

710
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,166
- Are you following me?

711
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,869
- Then you also better have
authorization

712
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,304
From the justice department.

713
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,905
- Getting authorization
was easy,

714
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:45,175
Are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle

715
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,878
And that your girlfriend
is your associate.

716
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,179
- Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

717
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,214
- Oh, you went right there,
didn't you?

718
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,916
- Well, in the six hours
that I've been there,

719
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:57,020
Your girlfriend, who I just
mentioned works for you,

720
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,323
Faints at law school
for five minutes.

721
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,924
You guys meet at the hospital.

722
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,192
Then you have dinner
for two hours

723
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,228
Where you cancel
a private stock sale

724
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,064
That you both arranged,
and one hour ago,

725
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,932
That stock mysteriously
gets bought

726
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,268
By some shell corporation
set up last year.

727
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,270
- Wait, what?
- Bullsh...

728
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:15,038
Where you feign outrage
and you feign ignorance

729
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,107
To help sell the whole story.

730
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,014
Anyway, I just wanted
to give you a little heads-up.

731
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,485
Smile for the cameras.
Harvey.

732
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,591
- You gave me your word.
- And I kept it.

733
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,193
- Oh, yeah,
then what about this stock?

734
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,527
- Jessica must have done it.
- Bullsh...

735
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:43,533
- I didn't know about this
until five seconds ago.

736
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,602
- There are only so many things
I can buy, harvey.

737
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,238
- Listen to me, we can deal
with this guy's bullsh... later.

738
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,974
Right now, let me deal
with the stock situation.

739
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,576
I'll make it right.
- You can't make it right.

740
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,178
- Mike, you used to trust me.

741
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,382
I need you to trust me
right now.

742
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,368
- [whispers] rachel, wake up.

743
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,238
- Hey.
Where were you so late?

744
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,376
- I was out, thinking.

745
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,544
- Thinking what?

746
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,013
- I don't want to be a fraud.

747
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,982
- What?

748
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,984
- I love you.

749
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,320
I'm married to her,

750
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,188
But I don't want
to do that anymore.

751
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,723
I want to be married to you.

752
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,591
- Logan.

753
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,461
- Rachel...

754
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,596
Will you marry me?

755
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,265
- I can't.

756
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,034
- Why not?

757
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,437
- Because you'll always be
a fraud.

758
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,639
- How can you say that to me?

759
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,141
- [gasps]

760
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,576
- Hey.

761
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,211
You okay?

762
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,213
Hey.

763
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:06,583
Come on, go back to sleep.

764
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,386
I'll be here when you wake up.

765
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,462
- Who told you
to buy that stock?

766
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,130
- Excuse me?

767
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,431
- Let me start again.

768
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,768
I just found out
we bought the wexler block.

769
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,670
Would you by any chance know
how that came to happen?

770
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,572
- It came to happen
when I found out

771
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,274
The dark pool had been canceled
and I couldn't reach you.

772
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,077
- So you took it upon yourself
to make a preemptive bid.

773
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,112
- Of course I did.

774
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,114
If I hadn't,
forstman would have.

775
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,749
So why are you here?

776
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:42,219
- I gave mike my word
we'd postpone the sale.

777
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,087
- Well, I didn't give
mike anything.

778
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,355
- Do you even want to know why?

779
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,325
- It was because rachel
passed out at school

780
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:49,593
And was in the hospital.

781
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,028
- Is she all right?

782
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
- Do you care?

783
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,297
To be the villain in this,
harvey.

784
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,567
I am sorry rachel fainted,

785
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,202
But our obligation
is to our client,

786
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,039
And I'm not undoing that sale.

787
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,206
- We can't tonight anyway.

788
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,508
- Why not?

789
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,243
- Because cahill
came out of nowhere.

790
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,577
He's been having me followed.

791
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,147
He thinks mike and I
are colluding on gillie,

792
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,315
And if we undo that sale,
it'll just fuel the fire.

793
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,351
- I told you
I was still worried about him.

794
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,821
Have myself tailed
to pick up a possible tail?

795
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:21,391
- What did you come in here
to tell me, harvey?

796
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,360
- Now that sean cahill
is involved,

797
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,096
We also can't ever transfer
those shares to logan.

798
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,832
- Which conveniently helps
fix your deal with mike ross.

799
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,635
Doesn't matter.
We don't need to transfer them.

800
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,071
We'll just vote logan's way
when the time comes.

801
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,541
- Jessica, I gave mike my word.

802
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,210
- Harvey, I don't care
if you took a blood oath.

803
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:44,414
Our duty is to our client,
not a handshake with mike ross.

804
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,550
And this discussion is over.

805
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,625
- Checked you out.

806
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,095
You're free to go
on your own recognizance.

807
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,296
- How much was bail?

808
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:02,432
- Oh, it's okay,
I took care of it.

809
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,101
How are you feeling?

810
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,402
- You know,
I'm actually feeling...

811
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:06,404
I'm feeling pretty good.

812
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,637
In fact,
I think that I'm going...

813
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,273
- Rachel, no,
you can't do any work today.

814
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,175
- I'm just gonna
stop by the office

815
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:15,278
And put away just three files,
send four emails.

816
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,384
I have to do this
just for my own peace of mind.

817
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,390
- No more.
- No more.

818
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,494
I won't even tell anybody
that I'm there.

819
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:33,463
I won't.

00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,831
- Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

821
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:39,269
- First of all,
you were remarkable last night.

822
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,606
- Who said?
- Everyone in the cast.

823
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,876
- Um, you know, I don't
actually read the local...

824
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,712
- You should, because they said
I was a shock to the senses.

825
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,846
I bought six copies
this morning.

826
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:53,250
Because she thinks
she's such a great singer.

827
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,619
Louis, what I came in here
to say...

828
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,786
- Donna, I'm retiring.

829
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:00,390
- You're what?

830
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,659
- You helped me get over a fear

831
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,761
That I never thought
I'd get over.

832
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,397
But I don't want to see
the audience as the jury.

833
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,534
I don't want to have disdain
for them.

834
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,504
I am the audience,

835
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,574
And I want to love them.

836
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,377
- Louis.
- Donna, I'm sorry.

837
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,745
Because I know I'm taking away

838
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,246
Your last glorious night
from you,

839
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,583
But I can't go on again.

840
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,652
I, um...

841
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:31,888
I can't do it.

842
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,490
- It's okay, louis.

843
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,591
It's okay.

844
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,260
It turns out
that the other shylock

845
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:40,397
Only sprained his ankle.

846
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:44,801
Looks like he's gonna be able
to go on tonight after all.

847
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,504
- Wait a minute.

848
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,207
He never hurt his ankle at all,
did he?

849
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:59,749
A lot of things going on lately
with harvey and malone,

And sometimes the best way
to deal with disappointment

851
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,989
In one arena
is to accomplish something else.

852

that you're not a lawyer?

You could be.

Resting.

- God damn it, I knew it.

I knew you wouldn't fix it.

861

- I tried.
- You tried?

862
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,576
- And she's the managing
partner, and you know it.

863
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,577
- That wouldn't have
made a difference

864
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,648
- I fought jessica for you
and won more than once,

865
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,751
But this isn't
one of those times, mike.

866

when you gave me your word.

- No.

But I can't.

- Is that supposed to stop me?

00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,928
- No, I just wanted you
to know it.

Do what you have to do.

what can I help you with?

00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,591

What do you mean nothing?

I'm gonna find another way
to win this thing.

I'm grateful, but I'm not gonna
need your money anymore.

00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:12,542

but you've got it.

- What are you talking about?

- You think I didn't know
what you were up to?

888
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:22,452
You tried not to fund the money,

889
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,087
So you could leverage specter
out of the deal
