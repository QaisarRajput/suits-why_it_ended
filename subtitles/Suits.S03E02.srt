1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,405
Harvey: <i>Previously on</i>
Suits...

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,854
You're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:07,382
- to get your pipeline.
- Guilty as charged.

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,762
You think
you're not replaceable?

5
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:10,368
I've been doing this
before I met you,

6
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,738
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

7
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:14,872
Please don't do this.

8
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:17,241
Your beloved associates
are mine.

9
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,877
What you want is
a long, drawn-out trial

10
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,195
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

11
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,330
I'm here to tell you

12
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,831
he's recusing himself
from the case.

13
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,699
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

14
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,753
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

15
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:30,671
You want
to take down Jessica.

16
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,423
Yes, I do.

17
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,478
Holy shit.

18
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,931
Was that a good "holy shit"
or a bad "holy shit"?

19
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,216
Harvey, you just told me
that you're planning a coup.

20
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:43,851
Give me a second
to figure that out.

21
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,720
Not a coup.
It's a move.

22
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:48,239
And when you're done
with your lecture--

23
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,574
No.
No lecture.

24
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:53,110
I just have one question.

25
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,364
Do I get my own office?

26
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:57,865
Harvey, if you want
to be managing partner

27
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,283
and Darby
agreed to back you,

28
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:00,835
then I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

29
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,954
But before we start,
I want to make sure

30
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:04,839
you're ready to do this
to Jessica.

31
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:06,841
I am.

32
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:11,178
Then let's go beat the shit
out of Cameron Dennis.

33
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:12,680
I know you don't want
to see me.

34
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:14,515
And yet--

35
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:15,933
I just wanted
to let you know that I got

36
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,252
a copy of the letter that
Jessica blackmailed me with,

37
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,753
and I made it clear to her
that I would take it

38
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:21,639
to the D.A.
if she ever threatened me,

39
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,224
so what I did
will never happen again.

40
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,759
Never should have happened
in the first place.

41
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:26,927
Close the door
on your way out.

42
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,930
Donna and I
have work to do.

43
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,406
There's a harsh reality
I need to inform you of,

44
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:40,875
and it's a bitter pill
to swallow.

45
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:43,944
But the truth is,
a mistake was made.

46
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,913
A fatal mistake.

47
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:48,115
And as much
as I hate to admit it,

48
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,886
our time together is done.

49
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:54,555
No more work,

50
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,724
no more laughter.
[Chuckles]

51
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,010
Remember?

52
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:01,395
No more mentorship

53
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:05,349
and, um, no more anything.

54
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:08,402
See, I reached too high,
and I fell.

55
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,571
And my punishment is the end
of my tenure

56
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:13,324
as head of the associates.

57
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:16,193
[Claps]
So I would like to leave you

58
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:18,696
with the immortal sentiment

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,782
of Robin Williams.

60
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,035
There have been
other associates before you.

61
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,154
They believed they
were destined for great things,

62
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,539
just like you.

63
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:33,377
If you just listen,

64
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:37,298
you can hear 'em whisper
their legacy to you.

65
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,633
Carpe diem.

66
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,388
Seize the day, people.

67
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:47,475
Make your legal lives
extraordinary.

68
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,727
Oh, Captain,
my Captain.

69
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:53,864
[Sighs]

70
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,366
There was a time
I would've been relieved

71
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,619
to see that--
no more Louis.

72
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,653
It's just wrong.

73
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:01,355
This whole merger
is wrong.

74
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,357
How'd it go with Harvey?

75
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:04,408
It didn't.

76
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:05,359
Did you tell him
about Jessica?

77
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,962
Yeah.
He didn't care.

78
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,747
[Sighs]

79
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:10,998
What?

80
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,300
I just wish I could give you
a hug right now,

81
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,137
but I can't because we still
want to keep us quiet.

82
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:18,205
Well, come on.
You can give me a hug.

83
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:19,807
Something could've happened.

84
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:22,727
Something bad,
like a...

85
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,761
My dog could've died.

86
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:25,396
Oh, you have a dog now?

87
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,349
I was really close
to this dog.

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,401
Well, the best way
to get over the death of a dog

89
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:31,852
- is to get a new one.
- Mmm-Mmm.

90
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,187
- No?
- No.

91
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:34,555
[Mock crying]
I'm just--I'm just too upset.

92
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,574
I'm--I don't know
if I'm ready

93
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:39,110
for a new fake dog
right now.

94
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:40,244
- Okay.
- Yeah.

95
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,246
Just leave me
like this.

96
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:50,743
How did it go?

97
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,182
I don't know.
Awful.

98
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,800
Probably the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

99
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,101
Louis, we just merged,

100
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:02,104
and I wish I could undo
you losing the associates,

101
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,689
but I can't.

102
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,141
What I can do

103
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:07,560
is take
what you've been giving

104
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,112
to so many for so long

105
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:11,981
and have you channel it
into one.

106
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,866
You mean...

107
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,869
I want you to mentor
your own associate.

108
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,241
Finally.

109
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:26,278
The D'Artagnan to my Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis.

110
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,497
All for one
and one for all.

111
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,833
<i>En garde!</i>
<i>[Both chuckle]</i>

112
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,252
Sorry.

113
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,305
Jessica, wait.

114
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,224
I can have anyone?

115
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,810
Louis, take your pick
of the litter.

116
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,099
- Good morning, Ms. Paulsen.
- Spit it out.

117
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,567
Is that any way to start
the day?

118
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,019
You want something.

119
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,270
I need the 411
on the breakup.

120
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,322
- Are we in high school?
- Life is high school.

121
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:54,473
And I need to know
if the prom king

122
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,826
and his boy wonder
are still an item.

123
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,110
What high school
did you go to?

124
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,862
Donna,
it's a simple question.

125
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,198
Did Mike and Harvey
<i>break up</i> break up,

126
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,950
or did they take a time-out
and, like, say to each other,

127
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,453
"hey, let's see other people
and make sure that we're sure."

128
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:09,955
I see what's going on here.

129
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:11,374
Jessica feels sorry
for you,

130
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,792
so she's given you
your pick of the litter.

131
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:14,159
And now you're sniffing
around here,

132
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:16,178
trying to put the moves on Mike
behind Harvey's back.

133
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,223
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I would never do that.

134
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,383
No, that's why I'm here
to ask permission.

135
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,834
So ask him.

136
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:22,885
Well, I think
it might go better

137
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:23,936
coming
from a different source.

138
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,805
- You want me to ask him.
- Yeah.

139
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:26,839
- Would you please?
- No.

140
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,940
Why?

141
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:28,941
Because it would be
so much more fun

142
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,644
for me to listen to you
ask him.

143
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:32,728
Well, let me
get this straight.

144
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,397
You want my permission
to take Mike

145
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,115
and force him to be
your associate.

146
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:37,900
No, I would never force him
to do anything.

147
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,068
It has to be consensual.

148
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:42,354
Not like Sally Jones
and senior prom.

149
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,323
Wait a second.
Did you just admit to a crime?

150
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,659
No, a crime was committed
upon me.

151
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,861
Okay, I don't want to,
but I have to.

152
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,713
What crime?

153
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,866
My mom felt bad for Sally,
so she forced me to take her.

154
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:57,470
Well, what was so bad
about her?

155
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:01,307
She had four nipples.

156
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,476
Okay, if that date
was so bad,

157
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,845
[laughs] I mean,
how did you find that out?

158
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:06,846
Okay, you know what,
Harvey,

159
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,481
do I have your blessing
or not?

160
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:10,015
Knock yourself out,
Louis.

161
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,600
See, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

162
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,652
You're just saying that because
you think he's gonna say no.

163
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,522
- Oh, I know he'll say no.
- Well, I know you're wrong.

164
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,556
So you better think
about this very carefully,

165
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,408
because once permission
is given,

166
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:21,894
you cannot go back.

167
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:23,579
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

168
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,064
Fine.
He's yours.

169
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,417
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

170
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:31,120
Good, 'cause
when I'm done with him,

171
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:35,508
Mike Ross will be begging
to be my associate.

183
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,834
Well, well,
what a surprise.

184
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,320
Jessica.

185
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:14,771
Last time we saw each other,

186
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,857
you were blackmailing me
out of my job.

187
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,408
Here to do it again?

188
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:19,860
Because you gave me
what you had on me.

189
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:21,495
I just want
to make one thing clear.

190
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,814
What I did to you,
I did to you.

191
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:25,947
Don't take it out
on Harvey.

192
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:27,984
Oh, that's sweet.

193
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,986
Like a mother
protecting her cub.

194
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,155
Take me on
anytime you want,

195
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,041
but don't punish
Harvey's client

196
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,342
for what I did.

197
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,327
You did?

198
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:40,714
You just happened on evidence
from his time

199
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:43,383
at the D.A.'s office?

200
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,636
Oh.

201
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,004
Ah.
The redhead.

202
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,356
Well, it doesn't matter,

203
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,608
because he may not have been
the one to betray me,

204
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:52,976
but he didn't stop it.

205
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,978
So after you threw him
under the bus and I saved him,

206
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:56,730
he should have thrown himself
back under the bus?

207
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,115
You just don't get it.

208
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,516
Yes, I do.

209
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:00,784
What you're really pissed at

210
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,852
is that he chose me
over you.

211
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,371
Not you.
What you are.

212
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:05,855
I put bad guys away.

213
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,023
You try to figure out

214
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,075
how to let them do
whatever they want.

215
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,459
So don't come in here
telling me

216
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,379
that I'm taking something out
on Harvey's client,

217
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:14,197
because I'll tell you
something--

218
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,200
she did this.

219
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:21,922
You made me a mixed tape.

220
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,541
Watch it,
and then make me an offer,

221
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:26,143
which I'll reject
because...

222
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,895
[Chuckles] I got your client
dead to rights.

223
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:36,403
Mmm, mmm.

224
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:37,721
Well?

225
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,157
This is the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

226
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,109
That is the best steak
you <i>will</i> ever have

227
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,443
in your life.

228
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:44,995
As much as I appreciate
for once

229
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:48,081
not having to eat my lunch
from the hot dog stand,

230
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,333
what are we doing here?

231
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,752
Can't a man
just take out another man

232
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,570
in the middle of the day
for some steak and some wine

233
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,340
and some cheesecake that's
gonna knock your socks off?

234
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,208
Uh, some men could.

235
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,927
But I think you and I
both know

236
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,379
that you are not one
of those men.

237
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,930
- True that.
- Mm.

238
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:04,931
Want some more wine?

239
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,266
Don't mind if I do.

240
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,351
And you gotta
try this cheesecake.

241
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,469
Oh, no, Louis, I'm--
mm--

242
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,104
You know what I mean, right?
What do you think of that?

243
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:12,756
- Hey, Louis! How was the steak?
- [Grunts]

244
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,024
- Heaven.
- How about you?

245
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,442
Best steak you ever had?

246
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:18,228
Uh, best steak
I <i>will</i> ever have.

247
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,596
[Laughs]
You taught him well.

248
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,281
What are you guys,
brothers?

249
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,316
[Laughter]

250
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,483
Oh, I'm just kidding.

251
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,435
Louis here's got
a lovely sister, Esther,

252
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:26,570
two wonderful parents.

253
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:27,821
Who the hell are you?

254
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,707
I am Mike Ross.
Louis and I work together.

255
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,576
I wanted him to know
who he was working for.

256
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:33,943
- Oh.
- And I would like you to know

257
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,045
who's working for you.

258
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,380
'Cause Mike here,

259
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:37,748
he's the best steak
you'll ever have.

260
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,282
You want to know
what you're working for?

261
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:43,053
Tina, Gina, Adrian.

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,554
They've been here 50 years
between them.

263
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:48,008
They are my family.

264
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:51,561
That's
what you're working for.

265
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,563
I-I understand.

266
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:58,685
I do not understand.

267
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,820
Eminent domain.

268
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,905
- Shit.
- Final hearing's Tuesday.

269
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,408
If we don't win, this place
becomes a shopping center.

270
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,642
Then this place
becomes a shopping center,

271
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,661
because nobody wins
eminent domain cases.

272
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:10,330
But what if we did,
Mike?

273
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:11,498
Then he'd get to keep
his restaurant.

274
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,950
He would get to keep
his dream,

275
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:18,455
and I would get to keep
my dream.

276
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:21,007
- And what is that?
- To rewrite the law.

277
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,042
And the way to do that

278
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,510
is to win
an un-winnable case.

279
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:25,512
What do you need me to do?

280
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,433
You went to see Cameron?

281
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,101
I was just coming
to apologize.

282
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,208
For interfering
on my case.

283
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,336
He's pissed at you.

284
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,521
He's going to take it out
on Ava.

285
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:35,722
I wanted to let him know
the person

286
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,274
he should be pissed at
is me.

287
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,275
Well,
it's not gonna stop him

288
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:39,776
from taking it out
on Ava.

289
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,061
Which is why
I was coming to apologize.

290
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,145
Are you also going
to apologize

291
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:43,897
for sending the message
that I need you

292
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:45,615
to help me fight
my battles for me?

293
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,817
I don't want
to fight Cameron for you.

294
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,618
I want to fight Cameron
with you.

295
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,036
When the evidence
is stacked against you,

296
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:52,622
you do what O.J. did--
you hire the dream team.

297
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,708
Oh, that's our bar?
O.J.?

298
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,294
Did he walk or not?

299
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,295
Fine.

300
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:00,881
But I'm Johnnie Cochran.

301
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,501
You know.

302
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:05,585
You know I know.

303
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,753
Mike told me.

304
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,204
Nobody had to tell me
after you sent me

305
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,540
on that wild goose chase
after <i>American Gigolo.</i>

306
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,725
Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,310
You know, it's not
that you violated

308
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:14,878
the sanctity
of our friendship.

309
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,047
It's that you violated
the sanctity of Richard Gere--

310
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,149
something
I would like to do,

311
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,600
but not the way
you did it.

312
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,769
Look, I was just trying
to get Mike back with Harvey.

313
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,154
I understand.

314
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:25,889
Because I never want
their thing to be our thing.

315
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,107
It's not.

316
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,825
And the way to keep it
from becoming our thing

317
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,527
is to stop talking about them.
Done.

00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,400
And that is how Peter
treats every single person

478
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,501
who walks
through his door.

479
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:34,919
So I don't care
what they say.

480
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:38,206
Your Honor,
this is not a public benefit.

481
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,543
Your Honor, I'm...
I'm touched.

482
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,845
He makes me want to run
right over there

483
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,513
and get a steak.

484
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,515
But as for the Supreme Court
decision in Kelo,

485
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,517
public benefit is determined
on a quantitative,

486
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,252
not qualitative basis.

487
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,937
Well, I'm glad
you brought up Kelo,

488
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,523
because we happen to have
some quantitative evidence

489
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,524
right here.

490
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,476
Kelo was decided in 2005.

491
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,228
Eight years later
and still,

492
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,230
nothing has been built
on this land.

493
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,983
No jobs created, no taxes
collected, no money made.

494
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,901
Zero quantitative benefit.

495
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,654
Just because they say
it will be better

496
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:11,372
doesn't mean
it actually will be.

497
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,626
Even if it were true,
we have every right to do it.

498
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,295
The state determines benefit,
not the court,

499
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,746
and until such time
as the law is changed,

500
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,448
you have no authority to affect
the state's determination.

501
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,083
Uh, Your Honor, you can
establish authority today.

502
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,251
[Laughs]
There's no basis for that.

503
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,636
You have no choice
but to uphold

504
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,472
the established practice
of eminent domain.

505
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,724
I'm afraid opposing counsel
is right.

506
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,011
Demolition begins next week.
[Bangs gavel]

507
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,429
[Sighs]

508
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,015
I just remembered something
about <i>Moneyball.</i>

509
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,985
The A's never actually
won the World Series.

510
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,636
I'm sorry, Louis.

511
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,072
Now is not the time
to be sorry.

512
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,574
What is it the time for?

513
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,443
Get in.

514
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,162
Nah, I think I'm good.

515
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,414
Mike, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

516
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,416
It's just good, clean mud.

517
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,285
That doesn't make
any sense.

518
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,586
Is this about the fact
that I'm in the nude?

519
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:00,338
Please don't harp on that.

520
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,789
Yeah, I'm just saying,
I know

521
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,007
how the younger generation
gets hung up on that stuff,

522
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,258
but you don't have to worry

523
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,593
because you have
your own self-contained unit.

524
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,596
Okay, if I get in,
will you stop saying words?

525
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,835
[Exhales]

526
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,638
[Clears throat]

527
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,051
You know,
if you go in with boxers,

528
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,338
you're not gonna
have them later.

529
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,361
You're gonna have
to go smokeless.

530
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,681
[Groans]

531
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,857
That disloyal piece
of filth.

532
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,459
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

533
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,027
Do you?

534
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,413
Because I've heard you prefer
to work alone.

535
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,248
Well, I don't.

536
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,200
I may have been above him
when we started,

537
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,535
but for the last two years,

538
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,670
we worked together
side by side.

539
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,590
I'm not a sentimental person,
but it meant something to me,

540
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,235
and I thought it meant
something to him.

541
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,428
- He deserves to be shot.
- He does.

542
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,647
But I suggest
we promote him instead.

543
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,015
You want to give him
a new title

544
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,483
to keep him
from testifying?

545
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:05,737
I believe it will require
a substantial raise as well.

546
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:06,904
You know
that's not what I meant.

547
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,322
You're suggesting
bribing a man

548
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,690
to get you
out of your bribery charge.

549
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,026
"In for a penny,
in for a pound,"

550
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,528
mother always said.

551
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,997
This is
what Cameron wanted.

552
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,249
He didn't give us that video
so we wouldn't find Nick.

553
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,535
He gave us Nick,
so you'd try to bribe him.

554
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,286
Well,
how can you know that?

555
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,071
Because Cameron knows
people are who they are.

556
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,240
You bribed once,
you'll bribe again.

557
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,592
Well, then what are you
suggesting I do?

558
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,043
Because I'm going to make
a run at him.

559
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:33,131
No, I'm gonna
make a run at him.

560
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,772
Louis.

561
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,523
Yeah?

562
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,892
This is the best damn mud
I've ever had.

563
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,595
Hey, I--

564
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,649
I know why you picked me
for this case.

565
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,534
I wouldn't have picked you
if you didn't.

566
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:55,269
If you wanted me to be
your associate,

567
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,155
why didn't you just ask?

568
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,206
Because you would've
said no.

569
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:01,075
- Louis, come on.
- No, Mike.

570
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,577
I know what people
think of me,

571
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,278
and I know
what you think of me.

572
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,779
I knew you'd remember

573
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,215
all the bad things
about working with me.

574
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:08,833
I just wanted to remind you
of some of the good ones.

575
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,718
I remember
all the good ones,

576
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,470
but I also remember
after those things,

577
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,088
you going back to being

578
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,174
the same Louis I met
the first day of work.

579
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,976
The Louis who fired someone
right in front of my face

580
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:22,129
for the sole purpose
of teaching me to be afraid.

581
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,066
You're right.

582
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,319
I remember you once said
that my actions matter

583
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:30,104
and that it's not water
under the bridge.

584
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,906
You've changed me.

585
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,525
You make me want to be
a better man.

586
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,777
Wait, are you saying
I complete you?

587
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,412
You have seen <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

588
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,914
No, I'm quoting
my cinema hero,

589
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:42,149
the character of Melvin Udall,
expertly portrayed

590
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,784
by Jack Nicholson
in <i>As Good As It Gets.</i>

591
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,170
- Oh. Never saw it.
- Oh, well, then you're lucky.

592
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,588
Why is that?

593
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:48,956
Because you can still see it
for the first time.

594
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,209
[Chuckles]

595
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,378
The first time.

596
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,180
- Yeah.
- That's it, the first time.

597
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,998
- What?
- The judge.

598
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,134
You were making your argument
about the first time.

599
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,065
He wanted to rule in our favor,
but he couldn't.

600
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,105
I know, that's why we need him
to rewrite the law.

601
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,356
No, we don't,
because there's already

602
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,525
a provision in the law
that works for us.

603
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,776
It's in section--
No, no, no, no.

604
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:11,529
First of all,
I cannot mix work

605
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,114
with mudding, okay?

606
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,115
Let's hit the showers.

607
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,867
I can't wait to stick it

608
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,451
to opposing counsel.

609
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,453
Do you need me to give you
a hand out of there?

610
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,346
[Knocking]

611
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:28,226
[Sighs]
I know who you are.

612
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:29,528
You shouldn't be here.

613
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,446
No, Nick.
You shouldn't be here.

614
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:32,447
I'd like you to go.

615
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,783
No.
You wouldn't.

616
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,234
You'd like to give me
five minutes

617
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,986
to see if I can get you
out of the box you're in

618
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,989
before you sell your soul.

619
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:49,081
I didn't want to do this.

620
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,699
You wouldn't let me in
if you did.

621
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,384
I had no choice.

622
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,136
Ava's in trouble
whether I testify or not.

623
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,804
That's what Cameron
wants you to believe.

624
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,840
- You haven't seen the video?
- I saw a business transaction.

625
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,093
- You don't believe that.
- I can sell that.

626
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,728
You just got to keep your head
and shut your mouth.

627
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:03,845
Just do
what you're here to do.

628
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,147
Threaten me,
or offer me a deal.

629
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,482
- I've considered both.
- Cameron said you would.

630
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,401
Cameron's wrong.

631
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:10,525
I'm not going to do either

632
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:13,155
because I think
you care about Ava.

633
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,023
I do.

634
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,109
Then think about this.

635
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:18,910
Whatever deal
Cameron offered you,

636
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:21,196
it's based on a lie.
He doesn't have anything.

637
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,231
He's just trying to use
your fear

638
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,783
to pit you against Ava.

639
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,147
Look, I've seen it happen
before,

640
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:28,704
and the one thing
I can tell you is

641
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,372
you go through with it,
you'll regret it

642
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,506
for the rest of your life.

643
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:33,341
Because she'll
never forgive me.

644
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,511
Because you'll never
forgive yourself.

645
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:41,049
Okay, what is so important
that we need

646
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,517
to have
an emergency hearing?

647
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,753
Your Honor, we need to be
heard before demolition starts.

648
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:45,844
What's he going to do now,

649
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:47,105
tell us
about his first demolition?

650
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,640
It was riveting,
but this has nothing to do that.

651
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,308
Your Honor,
based on the new zoning

652
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:51,553
put through
for their project,

653
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:53,562
we're simply asking
for a revised valuation

654
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,314
of the property
that they're taking.

655
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:00,285
$100 million?

656
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,787
That valuation
has no basis.

657
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:03,321
It has
a mathematical basis.

658
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,323
Specifically, the present
value of future cash flow,

659
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:06,608
as shown right there.

660
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,109
Bullshit. You've heard
of voodoo economics.

661
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,461
This is voodoo math.

662
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:11,746
They're making crazy assumptions
to inflate their value.

663
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:13,114
Just like Kelo,
but that really

664
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,583
didn't seem to bother you
when it was in your favor.

665
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,051
Your Honor,
this is ludicrous.

666
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:17,219
They're only picking
that number

667
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,170
because they know
it makes our project

668
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:19,621
too expensive
to be feasible.

669
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:21,089
Well, in the words
of opposing counsel,

670
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,342
even if that were true,
we have every right to do it.

671
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,764
Hi, Donna.
I love your dress.

672
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,348
And I love
when you compliment me

673
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,399
before you ask
for something.

674
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,018
You're so insightful.

675
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:35,520
Look, I know we said
Harvey and Mike's problem

676
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,739
isn't our problem,
but Louis is stealing Mike.

677
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:39,241
It's not stealing
when someone's available

678
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:40,325
for the taking.

679
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:41,910
You knew?

680
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,029
- When do I not know?
- [Chuckles]

681
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:45,833
Louis asked
for Harvey's blessing with Mike,

682
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:46,832
and he gave it.

683
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,083
Why didn't you tell me?

684
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,317
Because we agreed
that their problem

685
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:50,786
isn't our problem.
I know.

686
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:52,337
But Harvey
doesn't really want this.

687
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:55,290
- And you know that because--
- Because he can't.

688
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:57,292
Look, he needs you
to do your Donna thing

689
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:58,844
and help him get over it.

690
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:02,097
Harvey listens to me because
I tell him what I believe.

691
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:05,016
What do you believe?

692
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:11,807
That Mike betrayed Harvey.

693
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,059
- Mike was blackmailed.
- And then he betrayed Harvey.

694
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,611
- Donna, how can you--
- How can I what?

695
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,313
I just spent
the last year hiding

696
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:19,614
your boyfriend's
double life.

697
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,483
I'd say I'm
a pretty understanding person.

698
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,351
But what I don't understand
is when someone

699
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:24,369
takes loyalty like that,

700
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,187
and they throw it
in the garbage.

701
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:29,541
Would you like me
to say that to Harvey?

702
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,244
Sorry I asked.
Won't happen again.

703
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:35,130
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- That was a great job, Mike.

704
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:36,965
- Thanks, Louis.
- Rachel.

705
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:39,668
- Looks like you won.
- The judge is ruling tomorrow.

706
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,970
Then what were you
just celebrating?

707
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:43,805
Well, we were
dead in the water,

708
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,307
and now we have
a fighting chance.

709
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:49,010
I'm glad.

710
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,178
Is something wrong?

711
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,731
Oh, I just got
into a fight with Donna.

712
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:54,215
About what?

713
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:55,400
I went to tell her about you
and Louis, and she just--

714
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,519
You went to Donna
about me and Louis?

715
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,271
- I thought she could help.
- You what?

716
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:00,856
I thought if she knew,
she'd go to Harvey,

717
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,187
and they'd just put
an end to it.

718
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:03,491
Someone butting in
and telling him what to do

719
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,110
is only going to push him
further away.

720
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,828
I didn't tell him
what to do.

721
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,947
I went to Donna.
If Donna tells him,

722
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:09,998
all it says is
that I'm too weak

723
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,499
to fight my own battles.

724
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,848
God, if it's coming from you,
that makes it so much worse.

725
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,754
Why?

726
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,405
What?

727
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,214
Harvey forbid me
to tell you anything.

728
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,216
You and Harvey
talked about me?

729
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,851
After we went out,
I went to him,

730
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,040
I said I wanted
to tell you--

731
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,437
And he said
I wasn't trustworthy.

732
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:33,605
It's not that.

733
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:34,606
He didn't want you
to go out with me.

734
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,807
No, it's not that either.

735
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,893
He didn't have a problem
with us going out, he--

736
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:41,696
Oh, so it's okay if you
screwed me so long as you lied.

737
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:42,981
Rachel.

738
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,432
Oh, my God.

739
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,984
That's why you cut things
off with me.

740
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,786
- I didn't want to lie to you.
- I can't believe him.

741
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,437
Rachel, he didn't
just risk everything

742
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:50,872
he had for me once.

743
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,574
When Jessica found out,
he put everything

744
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,492
he had on the line
for me again.

745
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,711
I hope you know as you
stand here defending him,

746
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,130
he has no intention
of ever forgiving you.

747
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,967
Because I found out when Louis
asked Harvey for his blessing,

748
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:03,835
he said, "Take him.
He's all yours."

749
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,303
So instead
of getting mad at me

750
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:07,722
for trying to get Harvey
to forgive you,

751
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,723
maybe you should
get pissed at Harvey

752
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,810
and think about moving on.

753
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,819
What the hell
is wrong with you?

754
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:24,189
I said I was sorry,
I gave back the office,

755
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:26,775
I helped you with your case,
I even blackmailed Jessica.

756
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:28,443
Harvey, I get that you
are pissed off at me,

757
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:29,577
but eventually,

758
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:30,862
you are going
to have to forgive me.

759
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,948
Forgive you for what,
making me hire Katrina?

760
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,316
Getting high on the job
your first week?

761
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:37,085
Betraying me
with Jessica?

762
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:40,121
Or for telling Rachel
about your secret?

763
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,092
You cut me loose.

764
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,510
Okay?
You fired me.

765
00:27:45,594 --> 00:27:47,545
I was at my lowest point.
She was there for me.

766
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,163
She's still there for me.

767
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:50,265
Congratulations.

768
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:51,653
I hope you two
are happy together.

769
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,435
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

770
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:54,936
Well, let me
tell you something.

771
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,137
It failed.

772
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,023
I actually like
working for Louis.

773
00:27:58,107 --> 00:28:00,108
He makes me feel
like I'm working with him,

774
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:01,810
not for him.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

775
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:03,561
Because I didn't give you
to Louis as punishment,

776
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:08,233
I gave you to Louis
because you and I are done.

777
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:11,352
Harvey,
I regret what I did.

778
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,488
But I'm telling you right now,
you're gonna regret this.

779
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:17,292
Maybe you didn't hear me.

780
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,995
I said you and I...

781
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,363
We're done.

782
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,842
Whatever it is, I'm not really
in the mood right now.

783
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:37,178
Harvey,
I know how Cameron works.

784
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:38,813
He's setting something up.

785
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:40,432
You think
I don't know that?

786
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:42,383
He's setting Ava up
to bribe Nick.

787
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:45,153
- Isn't that what you just did?
- No.

788
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,604
I went to him and told him

789
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:48,106
he'd regret being disloyal
to her.

790
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,742
Something I know
a little bit about.

791
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:52,727
Harvey, do you know
what started it

792
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:54,496
between the Hatfields
and the McCoys?

793
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:58,166
I didn't catch the miniseries,
but I heard Costner killed it.

794
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,233
Doesn't matter.

795
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:00,418
Because whoever
they say started it,

796
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:01,786
I guarantee you,

797
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:05,290
the other side says,
"bullshit."

798
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,959
You went to Darby
for this merger behind my back.

799
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:11,412
And then you picked a fight
with him behind my back.

800
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,798
And then you
blackmailed Mike behind mine.

801
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:15,517
And I was only able
to do that

802
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,352
because you brought a fraud

803
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:18,920
into my firm
in the first place.

804
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:20,638
So you do think
it's my fault?

805
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:24,476
What I think is
I regret where we are,

806
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,529
and I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

807
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:29,364
And what would the evidence
of that be?

808
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,733
What evidence
would you like?

809
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:32,867
Why don't you
tell me the truth

810
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:35,770
about why the hell
I'm on this case?

811
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,622
All right, Harvey.

812
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,273
I lied to you.

813
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:42,460
When I told you I fought
to get you on this case,

814
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:43,628
I didn't.

815
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,246
Darby made that call.

816
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:48,716
And I used it as an opportunity
to reach out to you.

817
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:51,052
- "Used."
- To reach out to you.

818
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,806
Which I am now here doing
without using anything.

819
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,558
So do you want
to let it go or not?

820
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,459
I want to know one thing.

821
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,294
If you had it to do over,

822
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:02,847
would you do it again?

823
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:08,236
Deposition's on the books
with Cameron tomorrow.

824
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:11,239
You want me there or not?

825
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,581
Harvey, I'd introduce
you to Nick,

826
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:24,713
but I understand
you two already met

827
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:26,247
when you witness-tampered.

828
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,766
Nick works
for Hessington Oil.

829
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,934
We're their lawyers.

830
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,435
Therefore,
I didn't witness-tamper.

831
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,603
And if you say it again,

832
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:32,688
I'm gonna slap you
with a slander suit.

833
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:34,890
Well, let me slap you
with something.

834
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,526
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow,

835
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:38,927
and he gave it
to your shareholders.

836
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:40,278
They're filing
some sort of lawsuit.

837
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:41,813
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

838
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:44,366
You son of a bitch.
You leaked it.

839
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:45,767
I deny that.

840
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,102
And if your client
says that again,

841
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:49,488
I will slap her
with a slander suit

842
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:51,740
to go
alongside her bribery charges.

843
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,342
And by the way,

844
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,577
Nick wasn't swayed

845
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:58,130
by your attempt to tug
at his heartstrings.

846
00:30:58,214 --> 00:30:59,915
Emotional pleas?

847
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:01,466
What did you do to him,
Jessica?

848
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:03,168
This is not the kid
I mentored.

849
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,170
Hold on a sec.

850
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,639
You were never my mentor.
Jessica was.

851
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:10,559
You're just
a fast-talking car salesman

852
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:13,095
that hides behind the line,
"I do good."

853
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:16,148
Now get out of my face
while I confer with my client.

854
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,571
You told me
you knew this man.

855
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,606
I thought
that was an advantage.

856
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,858
Instead, you've goaded him
into orchestrating

857
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,193
an attempt
to take over my company.

858
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,612
You know
how sometimes the doctor says

859
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:32,614
you're gonna feel worse
before you feel better?

860
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:35,316
- What are you saying?
- What he's saying is

861
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:39,287
let us know how you feel
in half an hour.

862
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:42,841
[Door opens]

863
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:44,426
[Door closes]

864
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:46,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

865
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:48,013
Do you have a second?

866
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,514
I want to talk to you
about how we left things.

867
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,100
I don't know,
did you run it by Harvey first?

868
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:53,602
- What?
- I understand

869
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,521
that he has final say on who
his employees fraternize with.

870
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,057
Look.

871
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:01,560
Harvey wasn't just
trying to protect himself,

872
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:02,861
Mike, Jessica, and me.

873
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:04,396
He was also trying
to protect you.

874
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,532
Right, my protection's
at the top of Harvey's agenda.

875
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:09,618
He barely knows who I am.
Rachel.

876
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:10,852
And if he did know me,

877
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:12,320
he would know
that I would never tell anyone.

878
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:13,405
Okay, look.

879
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,689
You want to be mad
at Harvey, fine.

880
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,991
But you might as well
be mad at me,

881
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:19,044
because I told Mike
the same thing.

882
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:21,129
What?

883
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:22,363
I dragged Mike
into Harvey's office,

884
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,167
and I told him
that Harvey was right.

885
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:27,368
- That Mike should lie to me?
- No.

886
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,589
I told him
that he should get over you.

887
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:39,214
Was that before
or after I came to you

888
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:40,882
and told you
that I kissed him

889
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:44,102
and that I called him
and told him how I felt?

890
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:46,188
It was after.

891
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,989
You told him
not to be with me,

892
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:50,218
and then you let me think
that he didn't care about me.

893
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:52,911
No,
I told him what I thought,

894
00:32:52,995 --> 00:32:54,112
and then I tried

895
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:55,717
to help you move on
because their truth

896
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:56,898
wasn't mine to tell you.

897
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:57,866
[Whispers]
I thought you were my friend.

898
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:58,950
I am.

899
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,418
You cared more
about protecting Harvey

900
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,453
than protecting me.

901
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:04,422
Yes, Rachel!
That's my job.

902
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:11,079
I get that everyone's jobs
are important.

903
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,181
This wasn't about a job
for me.

904
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:16,134
It was about having a life.

905
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:19,688
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

906
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:23,475
Rachel...

907
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,811
I'm going to walk away
before you and I can't go back.

908
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,485
It's the second largest
oil deposit found

909
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:34,953
in the last decade.

910
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:38,039
We had the contract for it,
but to get it out of the E.I.R.,

911
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:40,492
we needed the pipeline.
What were you told?

912
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:41,609
And by whom?

913
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,328
We were told
by Colonel Mariga

914
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,547
we could build the pipeline
if we paid

915
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:47,716
a pollution remediation fee.
But?

916
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:48,967
We'd already remediated
everything

917
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:50,552
that needed
to be remediated.

918
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:53,922
So what was the fee for?

919
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:55,473
It was a bribe.

920
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:57,976
And Ava Hessington
paid this fee

921
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,679
with the full knowledge
that it was a bribe?

922
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:04,015
Yes, she did.

923
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,650
On this screen here, Nick,

924
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,570
are you sliding
a briefcase full of cash

925
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:10,522
across the table
to Colonel Mariga?

926
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,941
Yes.

927
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:15,277
And you were aware
it was a bribe?

928
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:16,311
Yes, but--

929
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:19,414
How was Ms. Hessington
as a boss?

930
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,316
She taught me
a great deal.

931
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,418
- Did she trust you?
- I believe so.

932
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:25,453
- Rely on you?
- Yes.

933
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:26,487
Did she look
over your shoulder

934
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,756
on everything you did?

935
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:29,457
No.

936
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:30,792
Was she aware
of everything you did?

937
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,493
She was aware of this.

938
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:34,462
Yet all we have
is your word on that.

939
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:36,014
So let me get this straight.

940
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:38,633
She groomed you,
promoted you,

941
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,669
gave you autonomy,
then you engineered a bribe.

942
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:42,804
And when you got caught,

943
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,773
you cut a deal

944
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,975
to lay that bribe
on your mentor.

945
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,443
Is that correct?

946
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,444
She knew.

947
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:51,730
Yes.
You claimed that before.

948
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:54,616
If Ava Hessington
were convicted of this crime,

949
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,123
who would be considered
