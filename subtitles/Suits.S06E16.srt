Nathan what I did

until I can help him even more.

Help how?
By being a shady lawyer?

By being someone who wouldn't
have lost Sofia Price her home.

320

I cannot believe
you just said that to me.

321
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:52,336
I said it because it's true,
and you know it.

322
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,540
Look, I am gonna
tell Nathan everything

323
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:58,843
as soon as my hearing is over.
You have my word.

324
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,744
Why should I believe
the word of a liar?

325
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,247
Because of what I did
for those miners and the clinic.

326

You didn't do shit for me.
But fine, I won't tell Nathan.

We need to figure out what
Walter Samson's weak spot is.

Tell me how, and I'm all in.

341
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:42,570
Start by contacting
every person we know

342
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,572
and asking them what they know
about this asshole.

343
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,608
Because Gibbs
has something on him

344
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,009
and if I can't find out
what it is,

345
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,612
then I can't get her
off that committee.

346
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,247
Where are you going?

347
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,550
To see someone
who doesn't know Samson at all.

348
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:59,487
Before we get started,
I'd like to point out

349
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,667
these interviews are normally
for us to quickly approve

350
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,158
standard applicants to the Bar.

351
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,527
However, Mr. Ross
is no standard applicant.

352
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,829
Therefore, we will convene
for as long as it takes

353
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:10,565
before ruling
on his application.

354
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,667
Now...
Mr. Chairman, if I may.

355
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:15,537
Last winter,
Mr. Ross pled guilty

356
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,672
to defrauding
the citizens of New York.

357
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,642
Therefore, I propose we reject
his application right now

358
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,310
because Mr. Ross is a felon

359
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,913
and the New York Bar
does not accept felons.

360
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,260
Mr. Chairman, with all due
respect to the new board member,

361
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,850
you do.

362
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,919
Not only does the Bar
accept felons, but years ago,

363
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:34,055
this very committee
admitted Neal Wiesner,

364
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:37,080
a man who spent years in prison
for attempted murder.

365
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,014
Now, Ms. Gibbs may think
my crime is worse

366
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,848
than attempted murder,
but I don't think

367
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:42,661
it's worth throwing away
140 years of precedent

368

No, you're not

You didn't go to law school.
It doesn't matter.

There's an exception
called "reading the law."

See, right there, Mike,

So you tell me right now.

Yes, I did.

Julius, I work at a law
clinic, but not as a lawyer.

481
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,781
An opportunity presented itself
for me to become one

482
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,783
and I turned it down,
but then I had to sit there

483
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,585
and watch a woman
get put on the street

484
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,454
because I couldn't help her.

485

over and over and over.

to do something for you.

When I first met Mike Ross,
I thought he was like

621
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:39,818
every other criminal
I work with:

622
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:43,221
an entitled fraud who spent
his life cutting corners.

623
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,191
But I'm here to tell you,
he went into prison one man,

624
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,492
and he walked out another.

625
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,227
And in
my professional opinion,

626
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,064
he has the integrity to serve
his community as a lawyer.

627

While I don't doubt
your sincerity, Mr. Rowe,

just because he was able
to fool you

629
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,681
doesn't mean he's going to be
able to fool this board.

who responded to my statement.

632
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:04,316
- And why is that?
- Because you tried to paint

633
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,011
a false picture of his release,

634
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,324
and I'm here
to set the record straight.

635

The record is straight.

- No, we're gonna hear this.
- Thank you.

638

It's true Mr. Ross entered
into an early release agreement.

639
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:20,492
But it's also true that he
stayed in longer than he had to

640
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,260
to keep his cellmate safe.

641
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,363
And while he was there,
he risked his own life

642
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:27,032
to prevent a violent man
from falsely obtaining parole.

643
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,266
And for all we know,

644
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,268
he did that
for self-serving reasons.

645
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,315
And for all I know, that's
what you're doing right now.

I'm a prison psychologist.

self-serving men

do not risk their lives
to help people.

I don't call defrauding
your fellow man helping people.

I'm done wasting my breath
on you

655

if Mike Ross had reformed.

657

the world could use
a lawyer like Mike Ross.
