to ruin everything

945
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:05,742
that Jessica's ever worked for
by making an enemy

946
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:07,389
of the one man who's been
trying to help us?

947
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:08,790
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

948
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:09,991
You couldn't even
shine Jessica's shoes

949
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:11,159
and now you're trying
to tear her legacy down.

950
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:12,327
I was trying to live up
to her legacy.

951
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:13,317
Yeah, I don't give a shit

952
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:14,429
what you think
you've been doing.

953
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:15,630
- Harvey, please.
- You know what?

954
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:16,931
Just let me say
what I was gonna--

955
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:18,433
I don't care what you
were going to say to me,

956
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:19,990
Louis, because
all you care about

957
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:22,259
is proving to me that you
should be managing partner

958
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:24,339
when everyone in the world
knows that you shouldn't--

959
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:27,297
me, Robert Zane, even Donna.
Harvey, please!

960
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,110
Jessica didn't even want
your name up on the wall,

961
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:30,979
so if you think I'm gonna
let you be managing partner

962
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:32,602
while she's still breathing,

963
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:34,338
you're out
of your goddamn mind!

964
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:36,306
Harvey!

965
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:37,674
That's enough.

966
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:59,696
I have the start paperwork
for those associates

967
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:02,232
in case you want to
look it over.

968
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,269
I'll just leave it here.

969
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:10,140
I was gonna tell him,
you know.

970
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:11,875
I was gonna tell him
that he's the one

971
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,643
that should be
managing partner.

972
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,046
Louis, you may
have your flaws,

973
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:18,415
but he had no right
to talk to you like that.

974
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,318
Yes, he did.

975
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:23,298
I did everything he said I did,
and the reason I did it

976
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,122
is because
all I ever care about

977
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:27,457
is for people to see me
as more than I am.

978
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,459
- Louis...
- The funny thing is,

979
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,462
all I ended up with
was the shortest,

980
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:34,431
most humiliating run
as managing partner

981
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:37,300
in the history of the world.

982
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,136
If you ask me,

983
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:40,570
you may have had a short run,

984
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:43,106
but you made your mark.

985
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,690
What are you talking about?

986
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:50,414
Well, unless I'm mistaken,

987
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:52,215
we have ten associates
starting tomorrow

988
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:53,550
who chose to come here

989
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:56,119
over one of the best law firms
in the city.

990
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:59,423
They did that
because of you.

991
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,925
It was because of me,
wasn't it?

992
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,094
Yeah.

993
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:05,962
And you did that
all on your own.

994
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,365
Nobody asked you to do it.

995
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,535
Where I come from,
they call that stepping up.

996
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,806
You're right. It is.

997
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:17,051
Thank you for being
the secretary

998
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:19,643
to the shortest-tenured
managing partner in history.

999
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,645
Well, now that
you mention it,

1000
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,480
before you hand over
your reins,

1001
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:24,648
there's something you can do

1002
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,616
to cement the future
of this firm.

1003
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:27,884
What's that?

1004
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,486
Show a little love
to someone

1005
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,789
who's been loyal to us
for as long as I've known her.

1006
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,596
Rachel, you have a minute?

1007
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,065
Honestly, Louis,
I am swamped.

1008
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,733
So if it can wait
until tomorrow--

1009
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:46,236
Oh, I wish it could,
but it can't.

1010
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,804
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

1011
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,639
Except for one thing.

1012
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,475
I have been derelict
in my duties

1013
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,510
as head of the associates.

1014
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:55,312
I don't understand.

1015
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:56,925
Rachel, you've given your
heart and soul to this firm

1016
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:59,115
for almost ten years,

1017
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:00,991
and now that you're about
to become a lawyer...

1018
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:04,699
I'd like to formally
extend you an offer

1019
00:40:04,723 --> 00:40:06,623
to work here
as soon as you graduate.

1020
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:19,202
This says
second-year associate.

1021
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:20,604
I know it does.

1022

I...

1023
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:23,807
I don't know what to say.

1024
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:25,141
I think you do.

1025
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:31,515

Because you just
lashed out at Louis

when your intention was to

First Jessica, now Mike.

1048
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:39,716
They're family.

1049

And family's not supposed to...

Harvey, I've always stayed
away from a certain subject

00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:51,728
with you, but I can't anymore.

1052
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:55,465
You always talk like
we're your only family.

1053
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,600
We're not.

1054

You have another one,

with them.

You need to go make things right
with your mother.

1058
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:13,283
Because as long as you keep her
at arm's length,

1059
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:16,252
you're gonna keep looking to us
to fill that void.
