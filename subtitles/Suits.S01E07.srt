Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:24,616
You know there are easier ways

00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:25,717
if you're worried
I'll rat you out

- What? Come on, Rachel.
- Unbelievable.

Rachel!

00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,963
Rachel, come on,
let me buy you a fresh cup.

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,132
Are you actually
gonna buy it this time,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,433
or are you gonna steal it?

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,436
Okay, first of all,
I don't steal, I cheat.

13
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:41,507
There's a big difference.
And I don't do it anymore.

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,010
Oh, great defense.

15
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,778
I'm sorry, your honor,
I know that I murdered her,

16
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,816
but I promise
I won't do it anymore.

17
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:50,187
Look, I understand
why you're mad,

18
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,022
but I still don't think
you're being entirely fair.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,226
Not fair? What's not fair
is that you repeatedly

20
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:56,960
help people skirt a system
that stands in the way

21
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,964
of me becoming a lawyer.
You know what?

22
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:00,365
Why don't you give up
the whole Saint act,

23
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,166
since the only reason
you figured out I was cheating

24
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,767
is 'cause you were thinkin'
about cheating yourself.

25
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,268
Thinking about cheating
and actually doing it

26
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,404
are two very different things,
doctor analogy.

27
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:10,173
Oh.

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,307

00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:18,078
you manage to forget everything
important.

32
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,980
Follow me,
but don't talk to me.

33
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,987
Not bad, Harvey.

The Prague hotel, in the black
in less than three years,

35
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,359
and a successful I.P.O.

36
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,893
Who said passion
wasn't productive?

37
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,664
I don't know anyone
that's ever said that.

38
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,367
Jones, tell me something. Mm.

39
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,669
You have 30 hotels
in 12 different countries,

40
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:45,273
but you spent last week
in Daniel Vega's Lisbon resort.

41
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,175
What? Just, you know,
checkin' out the competition.

42
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:49,543
That was more
than a fact-finding mission.

43
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,278
You're thinking merger.

44
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,746
Do you honestly believe
that I'd do that

45
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:54,147
without talking to you first?

46
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,916
- I know you would.
- Then perhaps I did.

47
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,151
Jones, if you try
to pursue a merger,

48
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:01,252
you may not control
what happens to your business

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,820
that you built so passionately.

50
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,622
Okay, Sherlock, hear me out.

51
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,626
Combined, we're 100 hotels
in 23 countries.

52
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,762
I like having multiple homes.

53
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,663
But you don't need
another name on the mortgage.

54
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,399
- It's a good deal.
- Yeah, and it's my job

55
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,034
to get you a better one, okay?

56
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,237
Promise me you didn't do
a handshake deal.

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,255

This is your debutante ball.

62
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,494
The impression you make
on the partners will last.

63
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:47,297
- And let me guess, Harvey was...
- Oh, legendary.

64
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,865
Shocking.

65
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,868
Sydney Thompson
was a consultant

66
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:53,437
with Lunders Global Initiative.

67
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,272
She had a few too many,
and decided to entertain

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,109
her friends with
an impersonation of her boss,

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,543
Lena Lunders.

70
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,145
This impersonation was recorded

71
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,015
and uploaded onto
a social networking site.

72
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,519
The next day she was fired.

73
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,322
Sydney is now suing
for wrongful termination.

74
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,824
We are looking to see
how you do under pressure.

75
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,726
Can't cheat your way
out of this one.

76
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,195
The partners
have been instructed

77
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,498
to only use the associates
in emergency situations.

78
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,904
Let the games begin.

79
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,140
- Whoo!
- All right.

80
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,409
When your name is called, please
step up and meet your match.

81
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,278
I think you mean

85
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:43,157
Last year I was forced
to play a traffic cop.

86
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,324
Jocelyn Lowenstein.

87
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,526
It was a total waste
of my talent.

88
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,794
Wait a minute,
you play witnesses?

89
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,929
Oh, I don't play anything.

90
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:52,800
I embody. And if I'm
on your team, you're a winner.

91
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:54,369
- Well, in that case...
- No.

92
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,837
Okay.

00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,462
Ross for the defendant.

98
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,131
May the best man win.
Oh, by the way, Kyle,

00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,950
I want you
to check annual earnings,

I'm out of my league

121
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:36,541
Listen to me.
Don't go to trial.

122
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,877
It's a mock trial.
I think the trial part

123
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,913
is kind of a prerequisite.

124
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:44,050
All right.
Law is about control, okay?

125
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:47,754
You can only control so much
with a jury, judge,

126
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:50,357
witnesses, and another lawyer
with an ego complex.

127
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,625
What if the lawyer
doesn't have an ego complex?

128
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,494
Every lawyer
has an ego complex.

129
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,362
The firm has presented
an exercise

130
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,797
where there's potential
for failure, okay?

131
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,933
All I'm saying is
try and create a situation

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,902
where that's not
even a possibility.

133

<i>Star trek. Captain Kirk.</i>

00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,843
He wins a no-win situation
by rewriting the rules.

137
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,379
- You're a Trekkie.
- Hey, Captain Kirk is the man,

138
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:14,880
okay? I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

139
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,283
Now, enough with
your fake law problem.

140
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:20,253
Let's deal with my real one.
Aye, aye, Captain.

141
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,394
You wanna know
how to do a cross?

142
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:28,296
Some people
like to use big words.

143
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:30,499
Some people like
to go for sympathy.

144
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,933
But personally,

145
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,969
I'm a little more go
for the groin.

146
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,704
Oh, hey, Mike.

147
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,405
You mind dismissing
the peanut gallery

148
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,741
so we can talk, Kyle?
I'm sorry, guys.

149
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,709
Looks like Ross here
came to plead for mercy.

150
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,612
Wow.

151
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,347
If you're here for
the witness/exhibit exchange,

152
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:47,648
don't bother.

153
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:48,848
I already
know who you're gonna call

154
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,417
and what evidence
you're gonna use.

155
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,385
Actually, I'm not gonna
call any witnesses

156
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,787
or present any evidence.
Let's settle.

157
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:56,523
Or I can beat you.

158
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,858
The plaintiff has shown
a pattern of making

159
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,426
derogatory statements
about my client.

160
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,761
- Hearsay.
- Not the emails.

161
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,263
Which have no tone of voice

162
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,731
and are subject
to interpretation.

163
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,667
Which is exactly why
your argument is shaky at best.

164
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,970
- Then beat me in court.
- Kyle.

165
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,706
There's a reason that Harvey
chose me to be his guy.

166
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,242
Do you really wanna
find out what that reason is?

167
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,881
And how do I know
this isn't some sort of trick?

168
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:19,849
It's not a trick.

169
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,752
This is our chance
to stand out.

170
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,019
Look, settling gets us
in and out of there

171
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:25,521
in five minutes.

172
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,455
You drop the suit, and you and I
spend the rest of the week

173
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:29,658
making ourselves
indispensable to the partners

174
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:31,426
while everyone else
buries their heads

175
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,494
in Candyland court.

176
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,966
I'm going against
my better judgment

177
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:39,768
and trusting you.

178
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,570
So we have a deal.

179
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,146
Daniel, paperwork looks good,

180
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:52,349
despite the fact that you two
decided to go lawyer commando.

181
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,751
The devil's always
in the details.

182
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,586
Harvey, I know
that impulse purchases

183
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:58,189
don't exist in your world,
but the timing was right.

184
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,224
And as for the details,

185
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,192
I'd like to leave that
to my man Scott.

186
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,259
Does he always like to be late?

187
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,594
She.

188
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,728
Just got off a plane
from London.

189
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:07,263
Oh.

190
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,203
♪ ♪

191
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,776
Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

192
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:23,278
Welcome.

193
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:25,647
- Hi. Thank you.
- Scottie.

194
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,515
- Harvey.
- Oh, you two know each other!

195
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,849
We went
to Harvard law together.

196
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,417
Harvey was fifth
in the class, and I was...

197
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,585
Oh, I forget. What was it?

198
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:32,852
Married to the library?

199
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,853
That's right. Number one.

200
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,821
Number one at studying.

201
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,692
Okay, this way.

202
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,760
Tell me, scottie,

203
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:43,230
what's my success rate
against you in the real world

204
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,798
where we practice real law?

205
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,533
Oh, Harvey, there should be no
winners or losers in a merger.

206
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,536
Just a happy new couple.

207
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,237
That's right, 3 and 0.

208
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,939
Well, I say we let
these two talk deal points

209
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:55,341
while I try your chef's
famous sea bass.

210
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,310
Absolutely. Play nice.

211
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:00,146
We like each other,
even if you two don't.

212
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,552
"Married to the library"?

213
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,887
It's not my fault
that the library

214
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:09,891
was the best you could do.

215
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,194
Do you have
the preliminary proposal?

216
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,230
No, I just flew in from London
completely unprepared.

217
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:17,466
Try not to be intimidated.
I use some big words.

218
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:18,967
Overcompensation
isn't that big of a word.

219
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,936
- It isn't?
- I can hardly wait to see

220
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,203
<i>the work of a senior partner.</i>

221
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,705
I see my promotion popped up

222
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,673
on your Harvey Specter
Google alert.

223
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,609
That's not all
that's going to pop up.

224
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,051
Can't remember
the last time we had a bed.

225
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,453
Pretty convenient that we're
working on a hotel merger.

226
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:44,924
Mm, remember the mining deal?

227
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,894
Shaft 27? How could I forget?

228
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:52,699
Listen, about
the due diligence...

229
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,468
Ah, ah, ah, Harvey.

230
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,137
You know the rules.

231
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,741
No case negotiations
till we're done.

232
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,009
I think that might be a while.

233
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,297
Couldn't resist seeing
brilliance in action, huh?

234
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:18,865
Actually, I have to be here.

235
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,934
I'm playing the part
of the plaintiff.

236
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,769
Wow. I knew you were pissed,

237
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,404
but I didn't realize
you were petty.

238
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,139
- What does that mean?
- It's an adjective.

239
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,207
It means small-minded
and spiteful.

240
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,009
You chose to work with the one
guy who's going against me.

241
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,944
- Kyle asked me, and I said yes.
- You know what?

242
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,412
It doesn't really matter,
'cause you're never

243
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,047
gonna take the stand.
Really? How's that?

244
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,615
It's a surprise.

245
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:39,885
But prepare to watch
a mock trial legend be born.

246
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,158
Is counsel ready to proceed
with opening statements?

247
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,160
We'd like to submit
a settlement agreement...

248
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,863
The plaintiff is ready,
your honor.

249
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,899
Which is it, counselor?

250
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,767
Um, the counsel
for the plaintiff

251
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,170
and I agreed
to a settlement yesterday.

252
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,738
He must've misunderstood.
We had discussed,

253
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,006
but I never agreed to anything.

254
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:02,141
Do you have a signed agreement?

255
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,110
Uh...

256
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:06,846
No.

257
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,314
Then we are ready to proceed.

258
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,883
You have the floor.

259
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,118
Thank you.

260
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,287
On march 31, 2010,

261
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,222
Sydney Thompson
was unwittingly recorded

262
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,757
on a cell phone.

263
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,425
She made a joke,
the type of joke

264
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,994
that I'm sure every person
in this courtroom

265
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:23,997
has made at one point
or another...

266
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,946
Mr. Ross.

267
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,749
Mr. Ross!

268
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,985
Are you ready?

269
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,053
Um, the, uh,

270
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,289
the defense...

271
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,857
Uh...

272
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,995
According to
Bowmaster V. Whitely,

273
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:55,863
if the party to a settlement
is surprised

274
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,731
by the repudiation
of the settlement,

275
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,367
then the court must provide
a reasonable amount of time

276
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,470
to prepare for the trial.

277
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,539
- Reasonable time.
- Yes, your honor.

278
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,109
You get five minutes.

279
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,510
Vega has more property.

280
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,211
Debeque has more potential.

281
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,414
Which is harder
to monetarily define.

282
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,316
This isn't a library, scottie.

283
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,984
My guy's an up-and-comer.

284
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,286
That's why your guy's pouncing.

285
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:21,822
Your client
is an impulse shopper,

286
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,490
which is what may have
made him a quick success,

287
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:25,559
but it could make him
an even faster failure.

288
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,394
So he's a passionate guy.

289
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,129
He falls in love with a city,
and he builds himself a hotel.

290
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:32,465
Who are you to argue
with his track record?

291
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,833
I'm a realist,
and I have never seen a deal

292
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,236
pushed through so quickly.
So what?

293
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:39,038
So your guy
might wake up tomorrow

294
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,873
and decide that he
doesn't wanna do this,

295
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,908
which is why I'm not
showing you our private books

296
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,911
without a signed deal.

297
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,913
- Is that a joke?
- Am I laughing?

298
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,215
Look, I may not have been
awake during our M&A clinic...

299
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:50,883
Except for when you
were copying my notes.

300
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,285
Which was no walk in the park.
You write like a monkey.

301
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,688
But in any case,
due diligence is a requirement.

302
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:04,030
I have an obligation
to my client.

303
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:06,933
Then we don't have a deal.

304
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,336
And everyone's gonna know
it's because you killed it.

305
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,305
You know...

306
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,374
<i>I don't see you rushing
to show us your private books.</i>

307
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,142
I have nothing to hide.

308
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,111
You can have full access
to our books right now.

309
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,913
Great. You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

310
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,915
Don't say it, Harvey.

311
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,419
Mike.

312
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,821
Hey, are you okay?
Now you care?

313
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,323
Mr. Ross,
I'm gonna have to ask you

314
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,291
not to speak to my client.
She's not your client.

315
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,826
She is Rachel the paralegal.

316
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:35,194
And I only have five minutes,

317
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,895
so you should really
get out of my face.

318
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,397
- What's your problem, Mike?
- My problem is that you

319
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,432
don't have the balls
to make this a fair fight, Kyle.

320
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,167
Lawyering
isn't about fighting fair,

321
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,802
and you'd better watch
your false accusations,

322
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,772
or I might just sue you
for defamation.

323
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,674
Come on.

324
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,079
The defendant wishes
to countersue.

325
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,048
- On what grounds?
- I believe that's my line,

326
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,050
counselor.

327
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,785
Defamation of character.

328
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,153
The plaintiff's video
negatively impacted

329
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:02,855
the perception of Lena Lunders

330
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,290
and impaired
her financial well-being.

331
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,791
That's ridiculous, your honor.

332
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,460
In order for there
to be defamation,

333
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,195
the statements made
would've had to have been false.

334
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,763
That's not the case here.
Then you should have

335
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:12,432
no problem proving that
in court.

336
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,069
The countersuit is allowed.

337
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,871
- Are you serious?
- Would you like

338
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:21,674
to approach the bench
and find out how serious I am?

339
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:25,812
Your honor, the defense
should've filed counterclaims

340
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,881
before the trial began.
Yes, he should have.

341
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,450
But no one
in this crop of associates

342
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,553
had the foresight to do so.

343
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,089
And we drafted a whole addendum

344
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:38,059
just because we assumed
one of you would.

345
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,094
So I'm going to allow it.

346
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,964
Do you have
a problem with that?

347
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,298
No, your honor.

348
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,633
This is now a defamation trial.

349
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,301
You have until Friday
to prepare.

350
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,241
Nice recovery.
Thinking on your feet.

351
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,976
But you wouldn't have had to

352
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:58,612
if you hadn't been so naive.

353
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,314
Thank you, your honor.

354
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,855
How'd the negotiation go?

355
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,557
<i>You come out on top?</i>

356
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:11,093
Why didn't you tell me
scottie was opposing counsel?

357
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,729
Because I didn't want you
to have performance anxiety.

358
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,531
About the case. She's tough.

359
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,166
- You're obvious.
- And your fly's unzipped.

360
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,001
- No, it isn't.
- But it was earlier today.

361
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,335
You can do better.

362
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,770
Ooh, is that what scottie said?

363
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,505
Type up the deal points.

364
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,007
I got her to cave.
Debeque's gonna run the show.

365
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,376
All I had to do
was show her our books.

366
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,412
I can't believe it.

367
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,913
You gave me, like,
the worst advice

368
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:35,882
anyone's ever given
another person.

369
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,218
Take the drama
down a notch, Juliet.

370
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,887
I tried to settle,
and I got completely blindsided.

371
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,824
I told you to settle.
I didn't tell you to be stupid.

372
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,459
What do you think's gonna
happen in the real world?

373
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,061
You have to be prepared
for anything.

374
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,329
Well, in the real world,

375
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:49,897
I won't have to
be looking for someone

376
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,933
to play my fake witness
in my fake trial.

377
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,268
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you think?

378
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,004
Do you think witnesses
are just gonna jump up

379
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,906
and present themselves?
'Cause they're not.

380
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,874
And sometimes
when you have one,

381
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:00,576
they disappear or recant.

382
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:03,011
And you know what you do?
You deal with it.

383
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,346
Mock trial
is about figuring out

384
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,081
what type of lawyer
you wanna be,

385
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,850
and there's only two types...
Winners and losers.

386
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,219
That sounds great, Harvey,
but I haven't prepared.

387
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,889
I don't have anyone to play
my client or my witness,

388
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,391
and apparently
I'm going up against someone

389
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,093
that I can't trust.

390
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,495
Figure out
a way to beat him anyway.

391
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,096
Winners don't make excuses

392
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,098
when the other side
plays the game.

393
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,455
Hey, Donna, I proofed
that final agreement

394
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,324
on the hotel merger.

395
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,627
Quick question... Has Harvey
ever heard of spell-check?

396
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:45,264
Oh, my God.

397
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,067
- Sorry.
- Are you...

398
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,368
No, no, no. It's okay. Here.

399
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,137
No, no, no.
You don't have to talk.

400
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,173
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

401
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,674
It's okay.
He says things sometimes,

402
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,376
and they... And they
cut to the bone.

403
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:58,112
He does it to me too.
I know, so...

404
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,247
It's not bad, right?

405
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,250
I can also do
the Demi Moore single tear...

406
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,552
Left eye or right eye... If that's
better for the character.

407
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,420
Okay, I'm scared.
What's going on?

408
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,755
If I'm gonna play
Lena Lunders for you,

409
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,658
I need to be able to use
my full range of emotions.

410
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:14,094
Oh, my God. I love you.

411
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:16,597
Yeah, I know.

412
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,232
Focus.

413
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,567
You need another witness,
and at this point,

414
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,202
everybody else
in the firm is booked up.

415
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,271
Aw! Is mommy helping you

416
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,041
clean up your mess, Ross?

417
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,377
Am I mommy in this scenario?

418
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:30,513
What? Uh...

419
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:33,916
Ross is just... A baby.

420
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,686
Oh, my God.

421
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:40,055
I cannot believe I'm gonna lose

422
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,657
to that tool. Okay, come on.

423
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,259
No pity parties.
Go to an outside source

424
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,027
for the other witness.

425
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:47,762
For the best friend
you need somebody pretty,

426
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,632
sympathetic,
and most importantly,

427
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,968
willing to go above
and beyond for you.

428

What are you doing here?

429
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,642
Jenny, come on,
I need your help.

430
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,445
Got nowhere else to go.

431
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,490
You yelled at me. Kissed me.

432
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,526
Pushed me away. Disappeared.

433
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,328
I haven't talked
to you in forever.

434
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,063
I don't even know
what's going on in your life.

435
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,398
Well, if you let me in,
I'll explain,

and I promise
it's a really good story.

437
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,573
So you've been living a lie
this whole time.

478
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:31,364
- But that's not you.
- Thanks.

479
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,900
No, you are charming,
and funny,

480
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,803
and trustworthy.
That's your power.

481
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,105
And that's great
when I'm trying to con my way

482
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,675
into the LSATs,
but this is a courtroom.

483
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,177
It's useless there.
But it's still you.

484
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:50,049
So?

485
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,385
Take a deep breath.

486
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,822
Okay.

487
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,025
Just talk to me.

488
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,228
Ask me where do I work.

00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:12,371
Where do you work?

Ask me how I know Sydney.

How do you know Sydney?

00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,145
She was my friend.

493
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:25,449
And I've missed her every day
that she's been gone.

494
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,852
And why aren't you
friends anymore?

495
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,790
I don't know.

496
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,429
If you do it like that...

497
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,231

You need to hydrate.

Um, a highlight reel?

As a matter of fact, we are.
Those were top moments, right?

516
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,127
- They weren't bad.
- No, they were great.

517
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:21,496
And I just realized
this was better.

518

You were the best
you've ever been,

and I know why. Why?

00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,402
You hid something from me
in the negotiation,

and I wanna know what.

522
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:35,709
You know what?
You are ridiculous.

523
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:37,945
Oh, you know what?
Don't do that, okay?

524

00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:04,706
Hey, Harvey.

536
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,675
You were right.

537
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:08,709
There's been a steady stream
of stock buying

538
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,678
by Vega's company
in the last 24 hours.

539
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,781
It's a hostile takeover.

540
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:15,650
Yeah, but why are they
disguising it as a merger?

541
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,586
They wanted access
to our private books.

542
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,722
She tricked me. What?

543
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,158
<i>She pretended she didn't
wanna hand over their books</i>

544
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,127
so I wouldn't notice
when she asked for ours.

545
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,695
It's a classic maneuver.
She made me think

546
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,097
it was my idea.
How do you know that?

547
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,967
'Cause I taught her
how to do it.

548
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,103
So now they see how strong
Debeque's company is,

549
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,406
and they wanna buy it.
And they'll be running it

550
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,807
by the time Scottie's
back in London.

551
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,142
Wow. I leave you alone
for two days...

552
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,011
Yeah, this is my mistake.

553
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,146
This is Halley's comet.
Take a good look,

554
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:44,881
'cause it won't happen again.

555
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,816
So what are you gonna do?

556
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:48,885
I wanna know which
of Debeque's hotels

557
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:50,753
are the most valuable
and how fast

558
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:52,421
we can get them on the market.

559
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:55,591
Wait, you want Debeque
to sell his best hotels?

560
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,093
It's called
the crown jewel defense.

561
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,095
We unload
the highest grossing assets,

562
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,065
and we make ourselves
look undesirable.

563
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,666
Debeque'll never agree to that.

564
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,535
Trust me.
Debeque has enough passion

565
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,172
for his company that he'll
be willing to chop off an arm

566
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,343
to save the body. Okay.

567
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:21,083
You know you had that memorized

568
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,452
the first time
you read it, right?

569
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,154
Yeah, but I
didn't finish reading it

570
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,456
because a certain witness
chose to be distracting.

571
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:29,625
That must've
been rough for you.

572
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,527
Yeah, you have no idea.

573
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,563
Mm. Where can I get some water?

574
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,298
I need to make sure
my voice holds up.

575
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:37,099
Right there.

576
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,172
I'll make you a deal.

577
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,742
The winner gets the girl.

578
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,612
You know, I'm never gonna make
another deal with you again.

579
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,815
- No? Why not?
- Hey.

580
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:53,618
- Aren't you late for...
- Oh, I am.

581
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:57,222
They remind me of a younger,
less attractive you and me.

582
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,657
Please don't
say things like that.

583
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,325
And I know
that you rigged the lottery

584
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,860
so that Mike would get Kyle.

585
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,462
Please. Rigged, expedited,
they're all just words.

586
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,165
Besides, don't you wanna see
what your boy is made of?

587
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,599
You talking bet?

588
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,334
Well, at least
three's a number.

589
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,403
- Yeah.
- Usual amount.

590
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,238
I believe we have a wager.

591
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:17,374
Well, you know what?
Some of us shower

592
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,309
before we go to work.

593
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,511
- Mr. Specter...
- You know what? Save it.

594
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,513
Right.

595
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,784
How you feeling?

596
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,586
- Good.
- Good?

597
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,887
- Yeah.
- Good.

598
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,323
Is it inappropriate
to take a Xanax

599
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,793
if you're a witness in a trial?

600
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,727
I've seen clients
do much worse.

601
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:40,599
Actually, I'm not a client.
I'm a witness

602
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,500
in a friend's mock trial.

603
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,835
One thing...
If you get into trouble,

604
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,537
don't play the case.
Play the man.

605
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,005
What are you talking about?

606
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,874
Good lawyers worry about facts.

607
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,343
Great lawyers worry
about their opponents.

608
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,846
Kyle is cocky and devious.

609
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:58,082
Figure out a way
to use that against him.

610
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,385
Okay. Anything else?

611
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,521
Kick his ass.

612
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,925
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, uh, Mike Ross.

613
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:09,395
Do you know him?

614
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,963
Uh, yeah. Uh, it's a big firm,

615
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,765
but I know who he is.

616
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,701
Yeah.

617
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:17,670
God, I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

618
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,705
I just know this
is a big deal to him,

619
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,407
and I don't wanna let him down.

620
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,208
Hmm.

621
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:28,646
Sydney Thompson was at a party
and made a joke.

622
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:29,980
It wasn't meant to be mean

623
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,083
or to be taken as fact,

624
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,052
and it most certainly
was never meant to be public.

625
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,089
- The defense will show...
- That Sydney Thompson chose

626
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,625
to publicly defame her boss
with an impression

627
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,460
that she knew
would be damaging,

628
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,464
both to Lena Lunders' reputation
and her company.

629
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,567
I call Lena Lunders
to the stand.

630
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,679
Uh... Do you need a minute?

631
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,648
No.

632
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,884
I can continue. Thank you.

633
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,956
Please.

634
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:13,259
I'm a self-made woman.

635
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:15,261
I created the Global Initiative

636
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,830
to target problems
in third-world countries.

637
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,100
I take my work very seriously,

638
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,537
and if a joke
can be made of that,

639
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:27,640
fine.

640
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,843
But as a woman in power,
people look at your success

641
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,778
and label you.

642
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,980
They don't know
the complexity it takes

643
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,049
for a woman to succeed
in this business.

644
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,385
And when someone
undermines that,

645
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:43,188
well...

646
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:46,959
We have to fight
for ourselves...

647
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,728
Don't we, your honor?

648
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,196
Objection.

649
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:54,166
So it's hard to be
a woman in business?

650
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,735
That has nothing to do
with the facts of this case.

651
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,171
Well, we can only understand
the damage your client has done

652
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,507
by fully understanding
the care with which miss Lunders

653
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,843
has built her reputation.

654
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,013
Um, I'm sorry.

655
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,384
Can you ask me the question
one more time?

656
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:14,487
Take a deep breath.

657
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,291
It's just you and me.

658
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:20,326
We're just gonna have
a conversation about your job,

659
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:23,296
okay? Yeah, okay.

660
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,698
How do you know
the defendant Sydney Thompson?

661
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:28,801
We were coworkers.
We started at the same level,

662
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,204
and then I was promoted
to be her immediate superior.

663
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:33,073
And do you know
about the video in question?

664
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:34,774
Yes. I was at
the party that night.

665
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:36,843
And what were you
celebrating that night?

666
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,578
My promotion.

667
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,581
Same night. That's interesting.

668
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,783
Miss Ginnesse.

669
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,352
What did you think
of the impersonation?

670
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,055
It was too far. It was mean.

671
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,757
So why do you think
miss Thompson did it?

672
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:54,293
Miss Lunders promoted me.
Sydney hated it.

673
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,395
And that's why
she made the video.

674
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,666
Well, thank you, miss Ginnesse.

675
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,635
Nothing further, your honor.

676
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:04,939
Did Sydney ever tell you

677
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:06,808
that she hated your promotion?

678
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,711
- Not exactly.
- Yes or no, please.

679
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,646
- No.
- Well, then how do you know

680
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:13,848
that she hated your promotion?

681
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,784
I could just tell.

682
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:17,318
Can you tell what
I'm thinking right now?

683
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:19,020
That you're wishing
I would agree

684
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:21,789
with everything you say?
No. I was thinking

685
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:23,291
that if you could
actually read my mind,

686
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,759
I wouldn't bother
asking you the questions.

687
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:26,127
But you can't read my mind,
can you?

688
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,129
No, I'm... I'm
managing director...

689
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,764
No. And I'm pretty sure
you can't read Sydney's either.

690
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:34,101
<i>And you actually have no idea
why she made that video.</i>

691
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:36,971
Correct?

692
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,274
I guess I don't. No.

693
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,849
Good afternoon, miss Scott.

694
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,686
Thank you.

695
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:53,523
Are you here to give me
a proper send-off?

696
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:55,825
I don't think we can do that
out here on the street.

697
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:57,660
- You sure?
- You tricked me.

698
00:30:57,728 --> 00:30:59,228
I'm impressed.

699
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:02,165
To be fair,
vega did want a merger.

700
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,000
I just convinced him that,

701
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,002
given your client's propensity
for rash purchases,

702
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,705
that allowing him to
stay in charge was a bad idea.

703
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:10,807
Vega needed Debeque's hotels
minus Debeque,

704
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,542
and I found a way.

705
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,544
One that he never
asked for or wanted,

706
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:17,347
and one that
he's never gonna get.

707
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,885
Was... Is this for real?

708
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:23,653
Three of Debeque's properties.
It'll be on the market

709
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:25,155
by the end of day.
He's never gonna let you

710
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:26,823
sell off his crown jewels.

711
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,625
See, that's the thing
about passionate clients.

712
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,293
When they're crossed,
they get angry,

713
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:31,928
and they'll do anything
to get back.

714
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,200
Don't do this, Harvey.

715
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:38,302
Look, there's another way
we can do this.

716
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:40,838
We can get our clients
into a room together,

717
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:42,772
you can tell them
you were wrong,

718
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,576
and we can convince them
back into a merger.

719
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:50,180
Miss Thompson,
what was the intent

720
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:51,748
behind your impersonation?

721
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:53,216
I was just trying to be funny.

722
00:31:53,284 --> 00:31:54,918
Everyone in our office
makes jokes,

723
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:56,486
and as a matter of fact,

724
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,488
Ms. Lunders encourages us
to be informal.

725
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:00,924
I can't win this just on facts.

726
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,758
- ...Passed over for promotion.
- But I expected it.

727
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:06,429
I think everyone
has the impulse to move up,

728
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:08,097
but at a certain point,
you just have to let it go.

729
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:09,665
So that's what I did.

730
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,167
What are you gonna do?

731
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,802
I've never held
ill will for my boss.

732
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:16,973
I'm gonna play the woman,
not the case.

733
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,641
You say you expected
to be passed over

734
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,343
for a promotion, correct? Yes.

735
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,645
And yet you applied
three times?

736
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,780
- Yes.
- And you were never promoted?

737
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:26,949
As I said, yes.

738
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:28,684
And when Nora Ginnesse
was promoted,

739
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:30,787
you wrote scathing emails
to the rest

740
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,689
of your coworkers in response.
No, not scathing.

741
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:34,391
The intent was to be funny.

742
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,792
Oh, right,
you like to be funny.

743
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,160
Who doesn't like to laugh?

744
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:38,861
Someone whose reputation
has been ruined.

745
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,162
- Objection.
- Just a thought.

746
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,031
- It's testifying.
- Sustained.

747
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:44,433
Mr. Ross, questions.
I'm sorry, your honor.

748
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,535
Forgive me. I was just
trying to be funny.

749
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:49,771
On your performance review,
Lena Lunders wrote,

750
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,941
"good work ethic.
Lacks skills."

751
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,776
Do you think
that's a fair assessment?

752
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,511
Fair? I... I don't know.

753
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,580
Well, your coworkers
were promoted,

754
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:01,550
and your boss
was calling you mediocre.

755
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:04,954
Are you mediocre? No.

756
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,823
So why haven't you
been promoted?

757
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,158
I don't know.

758
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,893
Do you think
you deserve better?

759
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,862
- Doesn't everyone?
- So why haven't you tried?

760
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,030
<i>- I have tried.
- Why haven't you improved?</i>

761
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,665
I didn't say
I haven't improved.

762
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:17,200
Well, your review did.

763
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:19,935
Your five years
without a promotion did.

764
00:33:20,003 --> 00:33:22,805
Look, you were so angry
that you weren't moving forward

765
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:24,640
that you lashed out
at your boss...

766
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,008
- No.
- Objection! Testifying!

767
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:28,009
- Everyone was moving past you.
- So what?

768
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,411
- People making good on their...
- Badgering, your honor.

769
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:30,979
- Sustained.
- People who could cut it.

770
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:33,381
<i>I can cut it!</i>

771
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:48,198
Excuse me, your honor.

772
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,135
Settlement's
still on the table.

773
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,304
- What?
- Let's settle. Same deal.

774
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:56,374
Win-win.

775
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,711
- No, I'm good.
- Excuse me?

776
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,046
I've seen
the Moony looks, Ross.

777
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:04,048
You like her, so you're
offering me a settlement

778
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:07,084
because you don't want
to hurt her feelings.

779
00:34:07,152 --> 00:34:10,322
But I'd rather see
if you'll break her.

780
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,257
Giddy-up, cowboy.

781
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,026
Counselor.

782
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,062
Would you like to proceed?

783
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:27,674
No, your honor.

784
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:30,810
- Are you sure?
- Yes, your honor.

785
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,613
Nothing further.

786
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,389
Well, normally we'd move on
to closing statements,

787
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,692
but it's been a long week,
and honestly,

788
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,526
we all know
where this is going.

789
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:51,096
So court rules in favor
of the defendant.

790
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,498
This court is adjourned.

791
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:58,971
Mr. Ross.

792
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,184
Naive and soft.

793
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:14,053
Not qualities we're looking for
at Pearson Hardman.

794
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:42,718
Gentlemen, I appreciate you
leaving the swords at home.

795
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,554
What started off
as a true merger

796
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,489
never needed to become
anything different.

797
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:48,190
Daniel, I want you
to listen to me.

798
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,392
I know Harvey, and he just
wants to merge your businesses

799
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,961
so he can double
his billable hours.

800
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:55,131
Quiet, Scott.
I wanna hear what he has to say.

801
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,668
I'm just here to get my client
the deal that he wants,

802
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:00,971
and what he wants is a merger,
is that right, Jones?

803
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,975
- That's right.
- Daniel.

804
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:06,411
Your law firm overreached
in a situation

805
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,979
where it wasn't necessary.

806
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,915
It's not entirely
Scottie's fault.

807
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,884
We lawyers all have
an instinct to win,

808
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,186
but sometimes we may not fully
understand what that means.

809
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:15,821
We understand what it means.

810
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:17,656
Well, maybe you do,
and maybe you don't.

811
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,726
For me, it would be
to see both men

812
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:22,461
return to the initial deal

813
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:25,131
so that you can grow
both your businesses,

814
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:28,434
instead of having one company
with a hostile reputation

815
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,135
and the other a shell
of what it once was.

816
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:33,539
I mean, that doesn't sound
like a win to me.

817
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,882
I'm sorry.

818
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,518
Let's just go back
to the original deal.

819
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:51,224
We can run it together.

820
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:03,069
You need anything?

821
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,738
'Cause otherwise
I'm gonna head out.

Celebratory drinks

823
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,108
Yep.

824
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,411
And what exactly
are you celebrating?

825
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,113
You know what? You can save
the disappointment, Harvey.

826
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,048
I know what I did. Do you?

827
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:17,584
Because what I saw
is that you backed off

828
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,319
because you were
worried about hurting

829
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:22,189
your girlfriend's feelings.
It was a fake trial.

830
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,190
All right? I weighed
the pros and the cons,

831
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:26,726
and I decided it wasn't worth
hurting someone for the result.

832
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:29,730
The result is you just told
every partner in this firm,

833
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:32,165
including myself,
that you have a weak stomach,

834
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,101
that you don't have
what it takes.

835
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,808
You know, you keep telling me
that I have to decide

836
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:43,710
what kind of lawyer I wanna be.

837
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,413
And if I were smart,
I'd probably be just like you,

if he wants it or not.
