1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,535
And you got your name
on the wall.

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,337
Now I want the respect
that comes with it.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,372
Meaning?

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,539
I want one of harvey's clients.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,274
(harvey)
my clients are my clients,

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,609
And if you don't get out
of my office

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,011
In the next three seconds,

8
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,645
Something's gonna happen
between you and me,

9
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,647
And I guarantee
it won't end with you

10
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,316
Keeping all of your teeth.

11
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,018
Avery mckernon
was the first client

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,386
I ever brought into the firm.

13
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,021
And they win, like me.

14
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,057
(mike) they know trevor
isn't in the class,

15
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,793
So they know he couldn't have
been the one to steal the test.

16
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,294
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

17
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,629
Thank you, sir.
I...

18
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,197
There's just one thing.
I'm gonna call harvard.

19
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,234
Believe me when I tell you
you're never going there.

20
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,369
Remember this?
No, you don't.

21
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,471
Because you can't remember
something you never knew.

22
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,606
You can't fire me.

23
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,408
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

24
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,079
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big,

25
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,148
You're going to be begging me
to take it off.

26
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,589
First of all,
give me that manhattan

27
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,691
And go get yourself a drink
a man would order.

28
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,293
Come back here in 15 minutes,

29
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,829
And if I still remember
who you are, I'll be shocked.

30
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,268
Okay, so why are we really here?

31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,503
I mean, you didn't just bring me
out to talk about khaleesi.

32
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,273
I did. Paul porter says
I look like her translator.

33
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,474
He's a throner?

34
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,309
Though he says
I'm a less-attractive version

35
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,444
Of her translator.

36
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,112
Okay, you're just trying
to get me to say

37
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,213
That you're hotter than her.

38
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,681
- Am I?
- You're way hotter.

39
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,516
But she has that accent.

40
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,751
Fair point.

41
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:30,289
You know, look, the reason
that I brought you here

42
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,825
Is to tell you that I know
that you told louis

43
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,560
That I got katrina a job.

44
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,263
- Look, I...
- Relax, I'm not mad at you.

45
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,132
But I do remember you
being the person

46
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,300
Who told me not to force things

47
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,334
That weren't meant to be.

48
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:45,337
Rachel, just because
a person gives advice

49
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,439
Doesn't mean that they have
to follow that same advice.

50
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,208
That's one of the core
principles outlined

51
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,843
In "the book of donna."

52
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,845
Seriously, though,
I didn't mean to tell louis.

53
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,613
It just came out.
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,315
Like I said, it's fine.

55
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,717
He actually ended up asking
if we could be friends again.

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,252
And?

57
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,555
And I told him that things would
never be the same between us

58
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,190
Unless he forgave mike.

59
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,492
And what did he say?

60
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,628
He said he couldn't do it.

61
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,597
(jessica) that's easy.
The jumper over ehlo.

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,734
Wrong, the switch-hand layup
over perkins and green.

63
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,902
I'm surprised at you, harvey.

64
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,570
The ehlo jumper
was a game-winner.

65
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,872
The layup was a statement.

66
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,474
"I can do whatever I want.
I own this league."

67
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,177
Are you talking about jordan
or yourself now?

68
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,146
Is there a difference?

69
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,547
A big difference,

70
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,550
Which brings me to why I'm here.

71
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,685
You can't do
whatever you want, harvey.

72
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,688
You want me to make things right
with louis.

73
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,490
He made things right
between jeff and me.

74
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,260
So I'm supposed to kiss his ass
forever because of that?

75
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,428
No, you're supposed
to make peace.

76
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,431
Jessica, I'm willing
to make peace,

77
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,599
But that's never gonna happen.

78
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,867
Why not?

79
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,170
Because louis
is never gonna forgive mike.

80
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,306
Then figure out a way
to make him forgive mike.

81
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,416
Donna, how many times
have I told you

82
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,517
I want you out front?

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,419
I'm the only associate
with a secretary.

84
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,421
It would be nice if people
could see my secretary.

85
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,456
Well, then maybe your next
secretary can figure out

86
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,227
Where to put this
without coming into your office.

87
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,962
- You're kidding?
- Not kidding.

88
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,397
You didn't forge this?

89
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,432
I am a lot of things,
but I am not a monster.

90
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,668
I would do that
to neither michael nor you.

91
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,836
- Oh, so he's michael now?
- Well, I'm donna to him.

92
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,773
He's michael to me, which
is what I told his airness

93
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,974
When he called.

94
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,310
Wait a second.
You're not kidding.

95
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,344
He signed with me?

96
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,779
Well, technically,
he signed with me.

97
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,715
Holy shit, donna.
We have to celebrate tonight.

98
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,417
Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.

99
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,452
You, on the other hand,
are having drinks with louis.

100
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,688
What?
We've been over this.

101
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,790
Whenever louis asks
to have drinks with me,

102
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,857
The answer's always no.

103
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,727
Listen to the words
that I'm saying.

104
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,896
You are getting drinks
with louis tonight.

105
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,831
Fairchild's retiring?

106
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,367
Fairchild's dead.

107
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,902
That's almost as good
as the jordan news.

108
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,970
Eh, not to fairchild.

109
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,471
Who gives a shit
about fairchild?

110
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,573
The real tragedy is
I have to get drinks with louis.

111
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,442
Which is why I got you
a secluded restaurant

112
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,510
With a table in the back
where no one will see you.

113
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,447
And you'll call a half an hour
in and say there's an emergency.

114
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,582
Already in place,
and if I can't get through,

115
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,818
Then I'll just have the waiter
spill drinks all over louis.

116
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,453
- You could have that done?
- Oh, please.

117
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,655
I could have louis held captive

118
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,489
In a tibetan monastery
if I wanted to.

119
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,924
Yeah, I don't think
you have that...

120
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,459
Now get the hell out
of your office.

121
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,461
I got work to do.

122
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,532
Hmm.

123
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,643
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where jim o'donnell's office is?

124
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,845
That depends. What do you know
about immigration law?

125
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,980
What, are we talking visas,
or are you trying to process

126
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,582
A labor certification?

127
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,317
You know about immigration law?

128
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,452
Doesn't everybody?

129
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,855
Okay, tough guy,

130
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,724
What do you think
about my strategy on this?

131
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,428
Hmm.

132
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,463
- I think it's a winner.
- Why is that?

133
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,732
Because everyone knows gonzalez
versus state of maryland

134
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,635
Was a kick-ass precedent,
but your case is better.

135
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,604
It was
a kick-ass precedent,

136
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,005
But I'm not sure that my case
is better.

137
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,307
Oh, it is.

138
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,308
Well, what
about viteri versus...

139
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,575
Trust me, it's better.

140
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,413
Viteri needed magic dust
and a sympathetic judge to win.

141
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,315
- Have we met?
- Nope.

142
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,849
But I'm mike, by the way.

143
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,884
Claire.

144
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,989
Are you sure?
Because you look very familiar.

145
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,458
Oh, that's probably because
I've been delivering packages

146
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,893
To your office
for the last two months.

147
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,594
But you haven't given me
the time of day,

148
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,898
Because you didn't think I was
smart enough for you.

149
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,766
It's 915.

150
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,635
Wait.
That worked?

151
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,470
It's working so far,
but I'm gonna need to know

152
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,038
Your full story
if it's gonna keep working.

153
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Well, I'll tell you
the full story

154
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,641
Once you give me
your phone number.

155
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,543
I'll give you my number
when I know the full story.

156
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,713
How about this? I'll tell you
everything you want to know

157
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,348
At dinner tomorrow night.

158
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,553
In that case, I'll show you
where jim o'donnell's office is.

159
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,855
Jim o'donnell's office?

160
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,424
Where do you think
I just came from?

161
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,796
[knock at door]

162
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,437
I need you do something for me.

163
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,605
Okay, what is it?

164
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,140
Never mind what it is.

165
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,376
Unless you want to go back
to whatever you were doing

166
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,644
Before I hired you,
you'll be here at 9:00 a.M.

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,447
This is the address
for your car club.

168
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,648
Oh, yeah, your memory.

169
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,751
I'd remember this
even if I had your memory.

170
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,619
It was right before
our first case together.

171
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,154
You're right, mckernon motors.

172
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,457
So this time be on time
and put your seat belt on,

173
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,726
Because we're about to take
a trip down memory lane.

184
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,974
- What are you...
- I think you call it a prunie.

185
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,744
Congratulations, donna told you
my favorite breakfast drink,

186
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,679
But what does that have to do
with the price of tea

187
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,780
In antarctica?

188
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,582
Donna also told me
that you were pissed,

189
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,551
Because you found out
I gave you a client

190
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,019
I didn't want
in the first place.

191
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,821
Hmm. And you think this is gonna
make up for that?

192
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:39,124
No, but I think giving you 50%
of mckernon motors will.

193
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,626
What's the catch?

194
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,663
The catch is, you and I
are about to take a road trip

195
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,199
To their corporate headquarters
right now.

196
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,602
You serious?

197
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,504
I don't joke
about mckernon motors,

198
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,239
And you know that as well
as I do.

199
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,010
To fairchild.

200
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,980
To fairchild.
God rest his soul.

201
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,648
Screw his soul.

202
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,218
You know how they say
"heaven just got another angel"?

203
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,488
They ain't saying it now.

204
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,989
Why do you keep checking
your phone?

205
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,992
- No reason. I just...
- Please, I'm not an idiot.

206
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,794
We've been here 28 minutes,
and in 2 minutes,

207
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,896
Donna's gonna call
with some preplanned emergency.

208
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,231
Louis, that's not...

209
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,766
Look, why do you think I used
fairchild's retirement

210
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,034
To get you to have drinks
with me?

211
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,970
Because you knew I thought
it would never happen?

212
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,705
Because he doesn't have
an heir apparent.

213
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,774
Louis, if you're thinking
what I think you're thinking...

214
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,910
Hardman's not gonna make
one of us senior partner.

215
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,745
I'm not talking about one of us.

216
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,914
I'm talking about both of us
convincing hardman

217
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,949
That two kick-ass
junior partners are worth

218
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,620
As much as one new
senior partner.

219
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:45,123
Louis, that is the best idea
you've had since I've known you.

220
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,592
Yeah?

221
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,594
Here's another one.

222
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,134
When did you come up
with this one?

223
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,570
Of our half hour.

224
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,604
[chuckles]

225
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,206
[cell phone vibrates]

226
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,575
Don't you have to get that?

227
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,210
No, I don't.

228
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,778
Let's drink to this.

229
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,183
Asshole.

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,720
That was donna, wasn't it?

231
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,223
Trevor, this is so stupid.

232
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,324
It's not stupid, dickhead.

233
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,759
I want you to see it
for the first time

234
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,960
From the middle of the room.

235
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,895
It's your apartment, assface,

236
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,765
And don't even think about
giving me a wet willie.

237
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,300
You suck the fun
out of everything.

238
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,035
Go ahead.
Open your eyes, dickfoot.

239
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,736
- "Dickfoot"?
- I was gonna use "assface."

240
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,771
It's all I could think of.

241
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,105
How do you even manage
in the world?

242
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,674
Are you just gonna stand there
with your your eyes closed

243
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,008
And mock my "dickfoot"?

244
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,177
I'm definitely not gonna
open them to see your dickfoot.

245
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,046
That's a good point.
I wouldn't do that either.

246
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,247
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

247
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,152
Wow.
Holy shit.

248
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,954
I thought you were getting
a studio.

249
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,790
Yeah, I was going to,
but then I realized

250
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,961
We can't both live in a studio.

251
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,995
What?

252
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,364
Welcome to casa evans and ross.

253
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,633
Trevor, I can't afford
half this rent.

254
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,667
That's the best part.

255
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,902
Don't worry about it.

256
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,370
I'm gonna pay
for your whole first year.

257
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,005
No, you're not.
I can't let you do that.

258
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,907
Michael, I start my new job
on Tuesday.

259
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,042
On top of that, I have
my friends and family business

260
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,644
On the side.

261
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,045
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
take charity from you.

262
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,380
Look, are you gonna
make me say it?

263
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,849
It's not charity.

264
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,050
I graduated, and you didn't,

265
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,753
Because you took the fall
for something I did.

266
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,054
I owe you.

267
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,093
[sighs]

268
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,061
Okay, I'll think about it.

269
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,330
All right, in the meantime,
think about this.

270
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,999
Ahh...
No, I can't.

271
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,401
- I got a date tonight.
- All right.

272
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,403
Wow, clubfoot, mustache,
all of the above?

273
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,306
First dickfoot
and then clubfoot?

274
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,408
Are words with "foot"
all you've got now?

275
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,645
All right, smart guy, describe
her with one of your sat words.

276
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,014
- Bigfoot.
- That's what I'm talking about.

277
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:53,985
For the record,
she's really hot.

278
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,322
(daniel)
let me get this straight.

279
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,090
Instead of promoting
an existing partner,

280
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,127
You want me to make both of you
junior partners.

281
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,928
Well, not make us.
We've earned it.

282
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,798
Earned partnership status?

283
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,367
That's a pretty bold statement
coming from two fifth-years.

284
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,869
Not just any fifth-years.

285
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,904
We're the best fifth-years
this firm has ever seen,

286
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,139
And you know it.

287
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,174
May I inquire whose idea
this was?

288
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,842
- It was both of ours.
- I was louis'.

289
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,077
(daniel) that's generous of you

290
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,245
To give him credit.

291
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,082
It was generous of him to come
to me with the idea.

292
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,018
The truth is, I wasn't
gonna make anyone partner.

293
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,088
But I do like admire
your gumption.

294
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,825
So here's
what I'm willing to do.

295
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,995
I will advance one of you
if you prove to me

296
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,997
Which one it should be.

297
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,231
No, see, that's the whole point.

298
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,033
We came in as a package deal.

299
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,334
You came in with a proposal.

300
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,805
I'm giving you a counter,
and it's take it or leave it.

301
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,340
What sort of proof
are we talking about?

302
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,477
Let's just say mckernon motors
is in play,

303
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,480
And landing them could go
a long way to making your case.

304
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,015
No way.
We're not gonna...

305
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,416
(harvey) all right, daniel.

306
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,819
You want mckernon?

307
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,088
I'll get you mckernon.

308
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,359
(louis) we're going to mckernon
motors, not your senior prom.

309
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,994
Why can't we just take
the car service?

310
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,130
Because we're going to
an engine manufacturer.

311
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,066
We need to show up
with a bad-ass car.

312
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,935
How about this little bad boy

Two different pearson hardman
lawyers on my schedule today?

469
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,849
I don't know, but after this,

470
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,417
You won't need to meet
the other one.

471
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,485
You're cocky.

472
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:41,619
I'm right.

473
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,287
You're also traveling
a little light.

474
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,423
Where's your
powerpoint presentation?

475
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,558
I don't need
a powerpoint presentation.

476
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,793
Why is that?

477
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,429
Because every lawyer in the city
has tried to dazzle you,

478
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,764
And you're still looking
for a date to the big dance,

479
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,768
Because they don't know
what you're looking for.

480
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,304
What exactly am I looking for?

481
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,273
Loyalty.

482
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,244
You're right.

483
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,746
I built this company
from the ground up,

484
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,915
And everybody that started
with me is still here.

485
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,283
And I know why.

486
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,718
You don't downsize
in the bad times.

487
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,686
They stick with you
in the good times.

488
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,156
And no other lawyer
has figured that out.

489
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,423
Not a single one.

490
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,791
Well, I'm the one, avery,

491
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,427
Which is why I know
you don't want me dumping you

492
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,696
For a bigger client
down the line.

493
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,399
How do I know you won't do that?

494
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,801
Because that's not the way
I work.

495
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,703
Well, it's a hell
of a nice sentiment.

496
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,839
But how do I know you're not
full of shit?

497
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,707
I'm glad you asked,

498
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:41,479
Because here's my
powerpoint presentation.

499
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,562
Okay...

500
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:01,532
I have a hearing tomorrow
against fletcher engines.

501
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,968
You win that, you're my lawyer.

502
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,412
(louis) seriously?

503
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,847
Okay, you know what?
Oh, jeez.

504
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,250
This is ridiculous.
You drive like a savage animal.

505
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,718
Louis, be a man and suck it up.

506
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,587
Suck it up?
I'm sitting in the death seat.

507
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,822
Fine. I'll pull over, and you
can sit in the back with mike.

508
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,657
Hey, I'm not sitting in the back
with a fraud,

509
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,893
And before you even think it,
you're not putting him up here

510
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,994
And sticking me back there.

511
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,429
Then what do you want, louis?

512
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,697
Because there is no way in hell

513
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,432
I'm letting you
behind the wheel of this car.

514
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,701
It's crystal goddamn clear.

515
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,736
You and I sit in the back, and
he chauffeurs the both of us.

516
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,272
Whoa, no. Even if harvey would
agree to that, which I doubt...

517
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,440
Shut the hell up.

518
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,774
You're not talking.
You don't get to refuse.

519
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,911
I'm not refusing, louis.
I don't know how to drive.

520
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,681
Holy shit.

521
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,855
You wanted to see me?

522
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,457
Uh, yes.

523
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,459
I heard you did well
with avery mckernon.

524
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,494
Well, then you heard wrong,

525
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,696
Because I killed it
with avery mckernon.

526
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,466
- Congratulations, harvey.
- Thank you, daniel.

527
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,468
You're welcome.

528
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,303
Unfortunately,
we can't represent

529
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,638
Mckernon motors after all.

530
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,939
Why not?

531
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,574
Well, it turns out
fletcher engines

532
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,009
Wants to sign with us.

533
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,478
Because they found out
I'm about to land mckernon.

534
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,614
Yes, and they're three times
the size of mckernon motors

535
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,349
Well, I don't care
how big they are.

536
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,685
I'm not dropping my client.

537
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,887
Yes, you are.

538
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,458
This was your plan all along.

539
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,661
Of course it was.
That's how the world works.

540
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,663
I don't give a shit
how the world works.

541
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,731
I gave my word
to avery mckernon.

542
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,300
Watch yourself, harvey.

543
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,535
I haven't gotten where I am
by watching myself, daniel.

544
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,038
And I don't appreciate
being used as a stalking horse.

545
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,941
Well, you may not appreciate it,
but let me remind you,

546
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,510
You work for me.

547
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,881
And I'm giving you the chance
to show me you understand that.

548
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,084
Let me remind you you said
partnership was on the table.

549
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,087
I'm gonna hold you to that,
and so will jessica.

550
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,559
[door bells jingle]

551
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,831
Hey, fart taster.

552
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,867
I thought you were coming over.

553
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,869
What, nothing?
It's a classic.

554
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,738
I'm implying your job
is to literally taste...

555
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,540
Hey, trevor,
I'm in the middle of something,

556
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,108
So I'll come over later, okay?

557
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,876
In the middle of what?

558
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,878
That girl I told you about,

559
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,814
She interns at a legal clinic,

560
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,949
And I am helping her
with a case.

561
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,117
Dickfoot gave you homework?

562
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,487
Okay, first of all, from now on,
her name is claire.

563
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,889
And second of all,
this is important, so...

564
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:42,093
Dude, what the hell
are you talking about?

565
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,632
I might have told her
that I'm in law school.

566
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,735
[chuckles] holy shit.

567
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,403
You will do anything
to get laid.

568
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,838
I am not trying to get laid.

569
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,607
I really like this girl,
and I have zero chance with her

570
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,908
If all I am is a bike messenger.

571
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,010
Yeah, well, you're definitely
gonna have no chance

572
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,712
If she finds out
that you lied to her.

573
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,915
Trevor, I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

574
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,386
You don't really want to talk
about anything anymore.

575
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,124
It's about the apartment,
isn't it?

576
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,860
- Yes it's about the apartment.
- Okay, you want the truth?

577
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,862
I haven't given you an answer
because of grammy.

578
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,029
You think I didn't know that?

579
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,664
Then you know
she's never forgiven you

580
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,899
For what happened in college,

581
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,001
And she is never, ever going
to let me live with you.

582
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,036
Then explain to her
that this is my way

583
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,638
Of making up for what I did
in college.

584
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,839
That is never gonna work.

585
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,875
You know what, michael?

586
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:34,445
If you're gonna do all of this
for some girl you just met,

587
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:38,149
Maybe it's time you stood up
to grammy for me.

588
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,422
How'd it go
against fletcher engines?

589
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,590
You cut them off at the knees
or put them in the ground?

590
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,492
They put me in the ground,

591
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,861
And on top of that, it was
in front of avery mckernon.

592
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:51,996
You lost in court?

593
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,599
I didn't just lose.
I looked like a fool.

594
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,634
Harvey, what happened?

595
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,602
The general counsel
for fletcher engines

596
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,871
Knew every move I was gonna make
before I even made it.

597
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,006
How could he...

598
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,941
Because hardman
must have tipped him off.

599
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,209
You really think
he would do that?

600
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,778
I wouldn't have yesterday,
but I sure as hell do today.

601
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,647
Then you have to go to jessica.

602
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:10,748
And say what?

603
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,083
Hardman's managing partner.
She's not.

604
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,186
I don't have any proof,
and I never will.

605
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,754
Well, then
what are you gonna do?

606
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,156
I don't know,
but I have less than 14 hours

607
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,625
To dig through 1,000 pages
of patent law.

608
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,993
[groans]

609
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,095
If only there was somebody
in the office who was an expert

610
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,197
On patent law.

611
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,065
Donna, I am not going to louis.

612
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,667
He'll never help me.

613
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,769
Well, that's too bad,
because if you can't figure out

614
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,571
How to patch things up
with louis,

615
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,606
Then you don't deserve
avery mckernon

616
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,875
Or that partnership.

617
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,083
What's all this?

618
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,887
Uh, a grandson can't order in
and set a table

619
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,889
For his grandmother?

620
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,591
A grandson can do
whatever he wants.

621
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,827
But the answer
to your question is no.

622
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,663
You haven't even heard
what it is yet.

623
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,699
I know what it is,
because I've been waiting for it

624
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,534
Since that kid graduated,

625
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,803
And you are not
gonna live with him.

626
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,507
That boy is the reason
you got kicked out of school.

627
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,510
You're the one that told me
to tell the dean the truth.

628
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,778
That was before I knew
it would cost you graduating.

629
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,280
And he's trying
to make it up to me.

630
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,716
He's gonna pay for my whole
first year's rent.

631
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:21,619
That will not make up
for putting your whole life

632
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,987
Into a tailspin.

633
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,955
- It's a head start.
- No, it's not a head start!

634
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,757
That boy is gonna drag you
back down with him!

635
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,259
Grammy, I'm never gonna let
that happen!

636
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,761
God damn it!
I forbid it!

637
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,165
[breathing heavily]

638
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,804
I'm sorry, michael.
I lost my temper.

639
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:44,208
But I know what he does to you,

640
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,280
And I know he'll
always be the same.

641
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,782
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I'm not the same?

642
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,018
What's changed?

643
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,886
I met someone.

644
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,693
And I'm gonna figure out a way
to finish school, and...

645
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,895
And then I'm gonna go
to law school.

646
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,065
Good.

647
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,334
Then do it from here

648
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,177
What's on your mind, mike?

649
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,645
You look lost in thought.

650
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,849
I was just thinking
about my grandmother.

651
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,655
We took a train trip
to d.C. Once.

652
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,357
[chuckles] we played I spy.

653
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,927
That's a nice story, mike,
but we are not playing I spy.

654
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,330
I'll play. It'll remind me of
dominating esther on our trips

655
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,998
To see our smelly aunt frida.

656
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,701
(harvey) all right, if it will
get you and mike talking, sure.

657
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:44,935
[clears throat]

658
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,972
I spy a fraud who probably
never even knew his grandmother.

659
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:50,174
All right, god damn it,
you got a problem with me,

660
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,775
Take it up with me,
but don't ever talk

661
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,010
About my grandmother again

662
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,778
Oh, I forgot, the poor orphan

663
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,914
From new york city
who I should feel sorry for

664
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,048
Because he never
learned to drive.

665
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,316
I'm telling you, watch yourself.

666
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,651
Why?
Because I hurt your feelings?

667
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,852
- Louis!
- I don't care.

668
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,621
For all I know, you're probably
not even an orphan.

669
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,856
It sure as hell wouldn't be
the first time a con man

670
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:06,890
Tried to make that claim.

671
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,058
- That's enough.
- No, it isn't.

672
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,660
Yes, it is.
Pull the car over right now.

673
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,395
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of him.

674
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,804
Hey, you got a minute?

675
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,139
Oh, wait.
Let me turn my back,

676
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,707
So I can give you the right
angle to...

677
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,010
You were right.
We should have stuck together.

678
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,213
I get it...
You need my help,

679
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,082
Because you got your ass wiped
in court this morning.

680
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,918
You're right. I did get my ass
<i>kicked</i> this morning,

681
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,053
But it wasn't a fair fight.

682
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,388
What are you talking about?

683
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,657
Hardman accessed my computer

684
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,725
And fed the other side
my game plan.

685
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,994
Okay, I'm still waiting
for the part

686
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,262
Where I'm supposed
to give a shit.

687
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,798
Hardman did it because
I refused to dump mckernon

688
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,299
For fletcher
after I gave him my word.

689
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,734
And why should I help you

690
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,269
When you couldn't live up
to your word to me?

691
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,804
I did live up to my word.

692
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,406
- We went to daniel...
- Oh, bullshit.

693
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,007
No, it's not bullshit.

694
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,942
I welcomed your idea
with open arms,

695
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,811
And by the way, when he asked
whose idea it was,

696
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,179
I gave you the credit.

697
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,982
You see, harvey, that's the part
you will never understand.

698
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,217
I didn't want the credit.

699
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,686
I wanted us to be a team.

700
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,920
Then let's be a team right now.

701
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,255
But you don't want to be a team.

702
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,823
You want me to help you
get mckernon

703
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,124
So you can make partner.

704
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,061
I want you to help me so I can
keep my word to avery mckernon.

705
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:20,431
And when I become partner,
I'll keep my word to you.

706
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,068
What the hell word is that?

707
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,103
That someday what you wrote
on that napkin

708
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,372
Goes up on the goddamn wall.

709
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,946
You seem to have done
a lot of work here, mike.

710
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,114
Oh, it's no big deal.

711
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,482
It is a big deal.

712
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:41,952
Mike found a loophole
in the immigration act of 1975,

713
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,187
And it's gonna blow you away.

714
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,788
I don't know about that,

715
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,890
But it may help hector suarez
stay in the country.

716
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,192
That's great.

717
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,094
And you're more than welcome
to stay and watch.

718
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,930
Unfortunately, claire, I need
you to run back to the office.

719
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,131
Marshall called in sick.

720
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,333
I need someone
to handle the walk-ins, so...

721
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,737
Okay.

722
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,306
Call me.
Tell me how it goes.

723
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,008
Yeah.

724
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,083
What the hell are you doing?
That's...

725
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,785
Gonna keep hector suarez
in the country?

726
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,520
Yeah.

727
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,288
Yeah, nothing's gonna keep him
in the country.

728
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,124
So what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna buy him some time

729
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,525
So he can get his affairs
in order,

730
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,260
And then I'm gonna give
his children a chance to stay.

731
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,863
[scoffs]
I'm just... I'm... I'm sorry.

732
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,165
Are you jealous of me
and claire or...

733
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,834
Hey, look, I'm not jealous,
and I was waiting

734
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,137
For her to leave to save you
the embarrassment.

735
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,138
The embarrassment of what?

736
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,806
That's good work.

737
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,174
I'm not talking about the work.

738
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,043
I'm talking about your
"bike messenger by day,

739
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,345
"Law student by night" bullshit.

740
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,380
All right, you don't know
what you're talking about.

741
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,882
What are you gonna tell me next?

742
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,518
Your roommate is a stripper
who's in medical school?

743
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,155
Tell me right now... I call
columbia, your story holds up.

744
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:54,958
That's what I thought.

745
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,927
Forget who I am,
and take a look at that folder.

746
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,829
- This is a man's life.
- Don't touch me.

747
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:00,030
If you know what's good for you,

748
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,032
You'll stay the hell away
from claire.

749
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,277
(harvey) daniel...

750
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,046
Did you know
that some of these species

751
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,849
Can live up to 200 years?

752
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,184
Fascinating.

753
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:24,588
Did you know fletcher engines
is picking up the pieces?

754
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,557
I guess congratulations
are in order.

755
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,125
I not here for a pat
on the back.

756
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm here to tell you
you're making me partner.

757
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,362
Partner?

758
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,199
I never said signing mckernon
was the key to making partner.

759
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,300
Yes, you...

760
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,235
All I said was landing them
could go a long way

761
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,503
Toward making your case.

762
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,537
Bullshit.

763
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,472
You said partnership
was on the table.

764
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,341
And I said I was gonna
hold you to it.

765
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,976
And I'm going to right now.

766
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,013
You don't hold me to anything.

767
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,421
But I did say partnership
was on the table, and it is...

768
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,057
Just not for you.

769
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,626
What are you talking about?

770
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,494
Well, I can't very well
make you partner

771
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,630
After I just told louis
I'm making him partner.

772
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,166
What?

773
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,202
You don't get it, do you?

774
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,638
This isn't about
bringing in business.

775
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,074
This is about figuring out
who would do whatever it takes.

776
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,942
I did whatever it took.

777
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,344
You didn't do a thing.

778
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,247
You had the chance
to triple our business,

779
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,515
And all you had to do
was take a knee.

780
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,417
You mean bend a knee.

781
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,521
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

782
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,590
But you're
an arrogant little boy

783
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,626
Who would rather win
than get in line.

784
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,330
Well, what the hell did louis do
to get in line?

785
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:43,233
He did whatever it took.

786
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,516
- Please get away from me.
- Claire, wait.

787
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,952
- Nathan told me everything.
- Just let me explain, okay?

788
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,287
No, explain what...
That you're a sociopath?

789
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,421
I'm not a sociopath.

790
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,989
I'm the same guy that you
hit it off with.

791
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,257
No, you're not.
You lied to me.

792
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,126
Yes, I am, and I didn't mean
to lie to you, okay?

793
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,294
I was gonna tell you the truth.

794
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,996
Then why didn't you?

795
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,132
Because you said you wanted
to be with a guy who was doing

796
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,434
Something good with his life,
and I wasn't.

797
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,970
So what, now you're here to
tell me that all of a sudden,

798
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,972
You want to dedicate your life
to helping people

799
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,407
Or some other lie like that?

800
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,109
It's not a lie, and what I did
would have helped hector suarez.

801
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,978
Yeah, but you only did it...

802
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,446
Claire, please,
you have to believe me.

803
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,282
After I met you, I decided
to get my shit together.

804
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,051
I am trying to get
my shit together.

805
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,086
Okay, mike,
you know what I hate more

806
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,956
Than guys who don't have
their shit together?

807
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,092
It's guys who lie about
getting their shit together.

808
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,699
Claire.

809
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,437
[car door closes]

810
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,506
Louis, fill up the tank.
I'll be back.

811
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,983
Well?

812
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,117
Well, what?

813
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,519
You heard what he said.
Fill up the tank.

814
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,021
Yeah, I did hear what he said.

815
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,457
He said,
"louis, fill up the tank."

816
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,396
Who fill up gas tanks.

817
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:20,530
Yeah, and where I come from,

818
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,099
If you take another step
towards me...

819
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,600
Oh, what, the tough kid from
the city is gonna beat my ass?

820
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,235
Louis, I'm telling you
right now...

821
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,075
You ruined my life.
You ruined my firm.

822
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,345
Louis!

823
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,117
[coughing]

824
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,560
[sobbing]

825
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,472
You son of a bitch.

826
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,640
Wait.
Harvey...

827
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,175
Tell me right now
you weren't the one

828
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:08,078
That gave fletcher engines
my game plan.

829
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,148
Hardman told me he wasn't gonna
make you partner anyway.

830
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,783
And once he offered it to me,
all I had to do was...

831
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,317
Sell me out.

832
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,287
How is what I did any different
than you going after

833
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,122
Mckernon motors
in the first place?

834
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,092
If you don't understand that
on your own, you never will.

835
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,494
So, from now on, you stay
on your side of the yard.

836
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:27,230
- I'll stay on mine.
- No, harvey, listen to me.

837
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,232
You told me you would fight
to get our names on the wall

838
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,500
Once you got on the other side.

839
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,069
I can do the same for you.

840
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,403
Did you hear what I just said?

841
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,138
I don't want you
doing shit for me.

842
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,606
Oh, so it would be okay
if you were the one

843
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,841
Who got there first?

844
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,676
It would have been okay
if you got there first

845
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,278
Fair and square,

846
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,413
Because then I would have
believed you

847
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,215
When you said you wanted
to be a team.

848
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:46,650
I do want to be a team, harvey.

849
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,118
That's why I helped you after.

850
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,320
No, you don't!

851
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,555
You don't want to be a team.

852
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,423
You just want to have it
both ways,

853
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,825
Because you're a disloyal rat.

854
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:56,560
You always have been,
and you always will,

855
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,229
No matter what it says
on your door.

856
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,700
Well, like you said, we've been
pitted against each other

857
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,669
Since day one.

858
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,440
You asked how many of the
50 associates we started with

859
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,275
Would make partner.

860
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,343
Well, you know what?

861
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,711
I don't give a shit
about the other 49,

862
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,247
Because I'm the one who did.

863
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,883
I'm the one who did.

864
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,518
And now get the hell
out of my face,

865
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,686
Because I have work to do.

866
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,905
You know he did that
on purpose, right?

867
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,540
Did what on purpose?

868
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,543
He asked you to fill the tank
because he knew what you'd do.

869
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,612
Knew what I would do?
What about what you would do?

870
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,283
He knew that too.

871
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,886
Louis...

872
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,155
You never even said
you were sorry.

873
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,531
I am sorry, louis.

874
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,933
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

875
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,905
I'm not a con man, louis.

876
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:19,376
Every single other thing
I ever told you was true.

877
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,953
Want to know something that I've
never even admitted to myself?

878
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,860
I never learned to drive
for the same reason

879
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,230
I never went to law school.

880
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,732
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident.

881
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:46,670
And ever since then,
I've never been able to...

882
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,272
Get behind the wheel.

883
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,811
And then harvey gave me
a license, and I took it.

884
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,484
You were 11 years old.

885
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:07,691
I mean, you must have felt
so alone.

886
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,814
I thought you said you
didn't believe I was an orphan.

887
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,801
I looked it up.

888
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,303
I had to once I found out that
you never went to law school.

889
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:23,006
You mean once you found out
that I'm a fraud.

890
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,841
You're not a fraud, mike.

891
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,512
You just never went
to law school.

892
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,384
Okay, frazier, you get a grape.

893
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,722
Ali, I got you a fruit punch.

894
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,360
You two work your shit out?

895
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,631
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's get the hell out of here.

896
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,014
I should never have lied to her.

897
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,282
Oh, screw her, man.

898
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,516
If she doesn't like you
for who you are,

899
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,717
She doesn't deserve you.

900
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,552
It's not claire's fault.
It's mine.

901
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,688
I know you were into her
and everything,

902
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,023
But trust me,

903
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,724
There are plenty of other fish
in the sea.

904
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,859
You don't know that.

905
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,427
For all you know,
I'm never gonna meet

906
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,495
Another girl like her again.

907
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,829
[sighs] michael...

908
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,398
Trevor, if I'm gonna have
to listen

909
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,699
To whatever you're about to say,

910
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,334
I'm gonna need a joint first.

911
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,436
Come on, I thought you were
trying to turn your life around.

912
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,972
I'll turn my life around
tomorrow.

913
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,308
But tonight
I'm a bike messenger, so...

914
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,043
- Dude...
- Trevor.

915
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,314
All right.

916
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,483
Fine.

917
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,985
And I know grammy
doesn't want you living here,

918
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,688
But you can crash here tonight
if you want.

919
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,965
[exhales deeply]

920
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,668
Donna.

921
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,904
Something wrong?

922
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,572
Why would something be wrong?

923
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:06,376
Because I don't believe you've
ever been in my office before.

924
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,945
No, nothing's wrong.

925
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,547
And I know it's not my place,

926
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,882
But I'm here to tell you that
I think you're making a mistake.

927
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:17,854
Is this about me not giving
people off for columbus day?

928
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,457
You know this isn't about that.

929
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,525
Harvey laid it on the line
with daniel,

930
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,993
And you didn't have his back.

931
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:27,630
Donna, I've had harvey's back
since the day I met him.

932
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,499
For your information,
when I found out

933
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,801
What daniel was up to,
I had him guarantee

934
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,136
Partnership was on the table.

935
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,938
And then you let him give it
to the wrong man.

936
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,873
That is on harvey, not on me.

937
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,041
What are you talking about?

938
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,746
Daniel was worried
that harvey couldn't put

939
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,048
The firm's best interests
ahead of his own,

940
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,983
And harvey proved him right.

941
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,918
Or maybe you're just
telling yourself that

942
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,654
Because you don't want
to stand up to daniel hardman.

943
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:55,625
Donna, there's a reason
why you are where you are

944
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,093
And I am where I am,
and that is because

945
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,729
One of us sees
the bigger picture.

946
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,135
You knew about fletcher engines?

947
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,138
What I know is that
harvey's time will come.

948
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,007
And if this little incident gets
him to think about other people

949
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,877
For a change, then I'll take it.

950
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,619
You're up early.

951
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:27,023
I'm up early,
because I couldn't sleep.

952
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,794
Where we you all night?

953
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,496
You know where I was.

954
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,168
I was staying
at my new apartment.

955
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,069
I thought we'd settled this.

956
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,705
You settled it.
I didn't.

957
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:46,609
[chuckles]
I'm telling you, that kid...

958
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,977
Grammy, for as long
as I can remember,

959
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,712
You've been calling him
"that kid"

960
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,614
Or "that boy" or worse.

961
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,984
His name is trevor.

962
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,754
And he's my best friend.

963
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,758
Look, I'm gonna do this thing
with our without your blessing,

964
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,626
But...

965
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,797
It sure would be nice
to have it.

966
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,634
Okay, michael.

967
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,705
I'm not gonna lie to you
and pretend I approve,

968
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,575
But...

969
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:22,745
You're a grown man,
and I respect your decision.

970
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,621
I love you, grammy.

971
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,023
I love you too.

972
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,096
Thank you.

973
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,131
I believe that's all
I need to know.

974
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,733
Thank you for your time,
ms. Pearson.

975
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:47,237
I will wait to hear from you.

976
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,741
Oh, one more thing...

977
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:56,513
Does your father know you came
to me for a job?

978
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,547
I-I...

979
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,815
Did you really think
I didn't know

980
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,150
You were robert zane's daughter?

981
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,220
Is that why
you're interviewing me?

982
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,588
Because if it is,

983
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,590
I would like to remove myself
from consideration.

984
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,893
If you don't want to work
for your father,

985
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,928
That's your business.

986
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,631
I'm hiring you
because I like what I see.

987
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,032
Hiring me?

988
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,635
You start Monday,
if that's not too much trouble.

989
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,270
I will be the first one in.

990
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,177
Aren't you gonna ask me
why I don't want to work

991
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,245
With my father?

992
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,980
I know why.

993
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,849
I have a dad just like yours.

994
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,017
He has his own law firm?

995
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,952
He's a surgeon.

996
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,987
But it's the same damn thing.

997
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,998
[giggles]

998
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,601
[exhales sharply]

999
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,904
- How are we on time?
- We're perfect.

1000
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,639
But I'm not going in there.
You two are.

1001
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,641
What are you talking about?

1002
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,043
I said I was giving you 50%
of mckernon.

1003
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:02,645
I didn't say I was keeping
the other 50%.

1004
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,783
Oh, so you finally realized
they need an upgrade

1005
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,184
In representation.

1006
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,619
Easy, frazier.

1007
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,154
You'd still be out cold
at that gas station

1008
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,622
If I hadn't saved your ass.

1009
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,724
Okay, I would have gotten out...
Eventually.

1010
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,626
- Not from where I was standing.
- I'm slippery.

1011
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:18,161
I told you...
I wrestled in high school.

1012
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,063
- I checked on that. He did.
- See?

1013
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,632
Oh, and now
you're fighting for him?

1014
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,200
Okay, I guess
my job here is done.

1015
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,635
Wait.
Where are you going?

1016
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:26,970
I'm taking the car back
to the city.

1017
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:29,138
Well, what the hell are we
supposed to do?

1018
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,642
Ray's waiting on the other side
of the parking lot, isn't he?

1019
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,344
He'll drive you two back
when you're done.

1020
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:36,312
Wait. You know what?
I have a better idea.

1021
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,147
How about you take ray,
we take the car,

1022
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,617
And I teach mike how to drive
on the way home?

1023
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,986
- You'd actually do that?
- Yeah, I would.

1024
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,921
- No way.
- You don't trust me?

1025
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,389
I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

1026
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:47,790
You're a goddamn fraud.

1027
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,325
- That's what I said.
- Harvey, seriously.

1028
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,094
- Come on, I promise
- okay, I know you will.

1029
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,895
Louis, you make one dent
in this car,

1030
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:55,097
Mike's back on the street,
and your name's off the door.

1031
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,305
You think he was serious
about what he just said?

1032
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,140
Okay, well,
I'm just a little nervous,

1033
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,908
'cause I feel like I drank
that power drink,

1034
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,076
And it has a lot
of sodium in it.

1035
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,911
Actually, it's like
drinking a hot dog,

1036
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,747
But the doctor says it raises
my blood pressure, so...

1037
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:14,050
(mike) I'm gonna need you to let
me do the talking in there.
