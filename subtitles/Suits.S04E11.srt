1
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:04,441
Mike Ross never went
to law school.

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,376
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,711
I still can't stay, Harvey.

4
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:08,846
I know.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,981
I just want to stop lying
to the people I love.

6
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:12,683
This makes it look like
Forstman's payment

7
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:13,884
never went to
any offshore accounts.

8
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:15,185
That's forgery.

9
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,021
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

10
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,055
I had no choice.

11
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,421
Bullshit, you had no choice.

12
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,357
You could've said no at
any goddamn point along the way.

13
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,926
One thing is for sure:
When all this is over,

14
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,828
I'm gonna fire the shit
out of you.

15
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,863
I went to Robert Zane,

16
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:28,197
and I asked him
to give Louis a job.

17
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:30,533
You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement.

18
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,036
If you can't do that,
what the hell good are you?

19
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,371
Louis won't be going to Zane,
and neither will you.

20
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,606
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

21
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:38,908
And why would I do that?

22
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:39,976
If you do, I'll owe you one.

23
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,410
Mike Ross doesn't forget
anything.

24
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,312
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

25
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,247
is because he didn't go
to Harvard.

26
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:48,951
You've been lying to me
since the day Mike Ross arrived.

27
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,153
I am your friend, Louis.

28
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,220
No, you're not.

29
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:52,754
And don't you ever say that
to me again.

30
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,222
You might as well
spit it out.

31
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:56,758
You asked me what I wanted
once before, and I told you,

32
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,593
and then you told me
that I couldn't have it.

33
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:02,097
Pearson...

34
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:06,601
Specter...

35
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,403
Litt.

36
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:18,073
♪

37
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:50,237
Want to tell me
what was so important

38
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:51,271
I had to get back here?

39
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:53,207
He knows.

40
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,810
I know what you're thinking.

41
00:01:56,844 --> 00:02:00,414
Why didn't Donna tell you?

42
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:04,551
I'll tell you why.

43
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:07,020
Because as my first official act
as name partner,

44
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:08,054
I told her not to.

45
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,524
What?

46
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,526
You heard me.

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,994
You can look at her
as long as you want.

48
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,361
She can't help you.

49
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,530
Because my name's going up there
first thing tomorrow.

50
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:18,564
No, it isn't.

51
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:19,666
Yes, it is.

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,867
But it won't be tomorrow.

53
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,181
I'm not waiting
just so you can--

54
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,436
Louis, I have to sell this

55
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:24,771
to the senior partners.

56
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,473
I can't just slap your name
up there one morning.

57
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,975
You did it for him.

58
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,209
I didn't resign the week before.

59
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:31,778
- I don't care.
- Louis.

60
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:32,846
That's enough.

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,580
This is going to take time,

62
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,215
and while it does, you're going
to keep this to yourself.

63
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,583
Bullshit.

64
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,485
You're just trying to buy time
so you can get out of this.

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,820
I'm not trying to buy anything.

66
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:44,658
We have an agreement,
and this is for your own good.

67
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,026
Well, for your own good,

68
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,260
you better remember what I'll do
if this takes too long.

69
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,019
Please tell me
you had no other choice.

70
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,268
You know damn well I didn't.

71
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,469
No, I don't.

72
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,337
That's because
you didn't see him.

73
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:01,506
All he's ever thought about
since the day he was born

74
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:02,975
was getting this

75
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,343
So if I have to choose
between giving it to him

76
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,378
and going to jail--

77
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,452
He really threatened that?

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,081
He didn't just threaten it.

79
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,949
He was going to do it.

80
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,450
And what are we going to do?

81
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,753
We're going to take it.

82
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:17,156
We give him this,
it is never gonna end.

83
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,893
Harvey, before you say
another word to me,

84
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,961
I want you to think
about the fact

85
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:26,397
that I just ate
a big bowl of shit

86
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,365
because you brought that kid
into my house.

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,368
And I had to take it,

88
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,071
so you're going to take it.

89
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,512
Harvey.

90
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,513
You don't need to say it.

91
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,183
Yeah, I do.

92
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,418
Louis came looking for you,
and I didn't know what to do.

93
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:50,387
He was gonna call Sheila
and tell her everything.

94
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,923
I'd never seen him
like that before.

95
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:52,924
Donna, this is not on you.

96
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,859
Yes, it is.

97
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,227
He pressed me,
and I broke.

98
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:59,329
It doesn't matter,
because he already knew.

99
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,597
How can you know that?

100
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,166
Because I know Louis,
and I know you.

101
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,968
And he couldn't have broken you

102
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,569
unless he knew
the truth already.

103
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:08,238
So this is not your fault,

104
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,992
and I never want to hear you
say that again.

105
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:12,075
I should've at least warned you
before you got here.

106
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,190
All that would have done
was antagonize him even more

107
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,614
because he would've known
you did it.

108
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,983
You did everything
you could've done.

109
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:21,317
Okay.

110
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,956
We have to tell Mike.

111
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,090
No, we don't.
Not now.

112
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,090
Harvey.

113
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,992
Look, I'll tell him
in the morning.

114
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,360
We just had a huge win,

115
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:33,395
and I am not in the mood
to ruin his night.

116
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:40,970
Louis.

117
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,507
What are you doing here?

118
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:50,112
They didn't tell you.

119
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:51,446
Tell me what?

120
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:55,350
Jessica made me name partner.

121
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:56,385
But, uh--

122
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,020
But? But?

123
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,420
But what?

124
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:02,090
I resigned in shame?

125
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:05,459
Well, that's all changed,
and it's all because of you.

126
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:06,761
Remember this?

127
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,062
No, you don't,

128
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:12,000
because you can't remember
something you never knew.

129
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,634
Cool to the end.

130
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,637
Well, it doesn't matter,
because Donna told me.

131
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:18,039
And Harvey.

132
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:19,207
And Jessica.

133
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,509
When I told them
that I knew you were a fraud,

134
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,012
did they run from you
like you were the plague.

135
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,046
What do you want?

136
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,447
I already got
what I wanted from you.

137
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,049
- Name partner.
- You must want something else.

138
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,363
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

139
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,052
See, that's what
I love about you, Mike.

140
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,254
Almost always a step ahead.

141
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,023
What I want from you

142
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:38,259
is to know that you're dead
at my law firm.

143
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:39,460
You can't fire me.

144
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,196
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

145
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,534
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big

146
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:48,836
you're going to be begging me
to take it off.

147
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,670
And all you have to do
is say two simple words--

148
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:52,739
the same two words
that you <i>let</i> me say

149
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,842
to Harvey and Jessica.

150
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,244
"I resign."

151
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,987
Louis.

152
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,922
- What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

153
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:11,925
That way I don't have to look at
either one of you two liars.

154
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,798
Oh, my God, he knows.

155
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,401
He doesn't just know.

156
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:23,337
He's a name partner.

♪ The greenback boogie

167
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,808
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.

168
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,443
And a little heads up
would've been nice.

169
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,711
I wanted to give you the night.

170
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,180
Well, the night
kind of got blown up

171
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,781
when Louis showed up
at my apartment

172
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,750
and said
he was gonna break me.

173
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:15,217
What do you want from me,
Mike?

174
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:17,420
I want to know how you let him
become name partner.

175
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,088
Would you rather we let him go
to the police?

176
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,391
I don't believe that Louis
would actually go to the police.

177
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:22,625
He would because Jessica said
he would.

178
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,659
So if you're here to say

179
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,094
that we can figure
some way out of it,

180
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,529
that's not going to happen.

181
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:29,565
He knows, and it's done.

182
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,366
Did you hear what I said?

183
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,635
Louis came to my apartment
filled with rage,

184
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:34,903
and he told me
he was making it

185
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,138
his personal mission
to break me.

186
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,173
Then you make it your mission
not to let him.

187
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,876
Harvey, he's name partner.

188
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,544
Did I ever tell you
the story about the gym?

189
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,446
I'm not really in the mood
for a story right now.

190
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,048
Then you're going to hear it
anyway.

191
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,820
When I was a kid,
my father put me in boxing camp.

192
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,122
Middle of summer, 90 degrees.

193
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,257
Every day after sparring
in that,

194
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,027
they'd make you do 100 laps
and 50 pull-ups.

195
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,829
They'd push you
until you either threw up

196
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:04,331
or passed out or both.

197
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,567
Anyone could leave at any point.

198
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,681
All you had to do was quit.

199
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,102
And let me guess,
you didn't quit.

200
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,471
I quit every goddamn day.

201
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,640
I just never
said it out loud.

202
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,174
Because no way
was I gonna give them

203
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,344
the satisfaction
of breaking me.

204
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:21,014
So I guess it's time for me
to drop down and give Louis 20.

205
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:23,550
I think it's gonna be
a little more than 20, buddy.

206
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,563
I see you noticed

207
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:39,432
I scraped your little
associate title away.

208
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,867
<i>You</i> scraped it away?

209
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:42,734
Yeah, just like
I'm gonna scrape you away,

210
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,336
starting with these.

211
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,604
Oh, Louis, go ahead.

212
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,606
Give me all of the shittiest
cases that you can find,

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,307
but I'm telling you,

214
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,375
it's not gonna break me.

215
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,410
You overestimate yourself.

216
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,546
Did you think when I said
I was going to bury you in shit,

217
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:55,581
I meant legal work?

218
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:56,849
No, no, no.

219
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,083
You're not a lawyer,

220
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,518
which means
you must be a paralegal,

221
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:04,222
and that's exactly the kind
of work you're gonna be doing.

222
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,191
Louis, you can't do this.

223
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,726
Everyone out there
thinks of me as a lawyer.

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,160
And two days ago,
they thought of me

225
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,442
as someone who used to
work here.

226
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:12,830
Look at us now.

227
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,665
Oh, and if you're thinking
of crying to Harvey.

228
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,867
that would be
a major mistake,

229
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,403
because this is
between you and me.

230
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,979
What are you doing here?

231
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,881
I'm here because
I know you're angry

232
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:32,016
and you're feeling betrayed,
but I am not gonna let you

233
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,885
throw our friendship away.

234
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,986
I can't throw away something

235
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,521
that never existed
in the first place.

236
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,995
- Louis--
- Donna, we're not friends.

237
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,491
We were never friends, because
it was all based on a lie.

238
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,092
So you think my giving you this

239
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,995
and every other nice thing
that I ever did for you

240
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:45,963
was just to keep you from
finding out about Mike?

241
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:47,965
No, I don't.

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,299
But I do think
if you had the chance

243
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,902
to take back
all those nice things you did

244
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:53,337
in exchange for me never finding
out about your little secret,

245
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,471
you'd do it in a heartbeat.

246
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:55,939
You want a chance
to tell me the truth?

247
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,475
Go ahead.
Tell me the truth right now.

248
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,344
And that answers my question.

249
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,412
You know what, Louis?

250
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:02,679
It was a
bullshit question

251
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:04,981
designed to do nothing
but make me feel like shit.

252
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,583
Mission accomplished.

253
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,252
And now I'm gonna tell you
what I told Mike.

254
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,220
- You're dead to me.
- Okay.

255
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:12,222
You want to hate me?
Hate me.

256
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,091
You want to hate Mike?
Hate Mike.

257
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,226
But everybody at this firm
can't be dead to you,

258
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:18,595
because sooner or later,
you're going to need someone.

259
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,696
Thank you, Donna,

260
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,898
but that someone
isn't going to be you.

261
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,439
Donna said
you wanted to see me.

262
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,541
No,
I didn't want to see you,

263
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,142
I needed to see you.

264
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,577
I know you're under
a lot of stress,

265
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,980
but that was a one-time thing.

266
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:38,582
I don't need you to do that
to me.

267
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:39,749
Louis has
already done it.

268
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:40,917
What are you talking about?

269
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:42,017
Look at this.

270
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:44,753
He's buried me
in paralegal work.

271
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:46,828
Okay, that's bullshit.
He can't treat you like that.

272
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,891
Rachel, I don't care
how he treats me, all right?

273
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,893
I can take it
until he gets over this.

274
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,360
But look at these deadlines.

275
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,063
There's no way I can get
all of this work done

276
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,097
on time without your help.

277
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,651
I will do whatever you need,
but, Mike,

278
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,001
he is not going to get over it
until you make him get over it.

279
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,336
- Rachel, please--
- Mike.

280
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,007
The day after what happened
in here happened,

281
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,141
I shut you out.

282
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:08,510
But then, a week later,
you came to my door,

283
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,213
and you said you weren't gonna
let me go without a fight.

284
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:12,581
That is not the same.

285
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,549
I wanted you
to fall in love with me.

286
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:18,052
I was already in love with you,
and you knew it.

287
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,687
Yeah, well,
Louis is a lot of things,

288
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,824
but he's not in love with me.

289
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,827
He used to be.

290
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,762
You just have to
make him remember that.

291
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,501
Okay, the first thing
we need to do

292
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,002
is finish all of this work.

293
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,202
Okay.

294
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,805
Unless, of course,
that offer still stands.

295
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't recall making an offer.

296
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:41,042
You did say
whatever I need.

297
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,409
That's not what I meant.

298
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:45,212
And then you said never
take no for an answer, so...

299
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,584
Lock the doors.

300
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,286
- Are you serious--
- Take yes for an answer.

301
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,788
I'm locking the door.

302
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,958
Louis, you sounded urgent
on the phone.

303
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:58,992
What's going on?

304
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:00,794
I'll tell you what's going on.

305
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,329
I'm back at
Pearson Specter.

306
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:03,531
What?

307
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:04,565
I don't understand.

308
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,067
Let me explain it to you.

309
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,602
I just became name partner.

310
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:12,406
Louis, this is amazing.

311
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,208
I'm so happy for you.

312
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:15,342
Okay, well, you can keep
being happy for me,

313
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:16,610
but you better start
being happy for you,

314
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,810
because I'm bringing you back.

315
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:20,580
What?
I--oh.

316
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,915
Katrina Amanda Bennett,

317
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,152
will you be my associate?

318
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:29,222
Louis Marlowe Litt,

319
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:31,123
I will be your associate.

320
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:32,525
Again.

321
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,227
You've just made me
the happiest attorney on earth.

322
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:36,296
When do we consummate our new
preexisting relationship?

323
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,498
As soon as my new position
is official.

324
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,800
- Wait, why isn't it official?
- I can't tell you that.

325
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,902
Louis, I think I've more than
proven you can trust me.

326
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:43,936
Oh, are you kidding me?

327
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,137
You're the only one
I can trust.

328
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,205
It's not that.
It's just--

329
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,759
Okay, Louis,
you don't need to tell me.

330
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:52,178
But if you won't tell me,
and they won't tell the world,

331
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,345
something's wrong.

332
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,780
Katrina, I know what I'm doing.

333
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,481
And Jessica knows
what she's doing,

334
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:58,317
which is playing you for a fool.

335
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,769
Harvey, I was just gonna
call you.

336
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:10,937
I'll save you the trouble.

337
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:12,805
We're bringing Louis Litt
back to the firm.

338
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:13,940
That doesn't matter.

339
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,254
Because that call was
to tell you

340
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,209
I'm hiring him,
and you owe me.

341
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,744
Bullshit.

342
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,046
You calling me a liar?

343
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,240
I'm not calling you anything,

344
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:23,449
but you are calling
Sylvia out there a liar.

345
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,685
Oh, no, no,
Sylvia wouldn't tell you shit.

346
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,719
Wrong.

347
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,954
One compliment
about her hair,

348
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:31,523
and she told me you gave Louis
the bad news an hour ago.

349
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,225
See you around, Robert.

350
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,728
Harvey, one more thing.

351
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:37,797
You do still owe me
that favor.

352
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:39,030
What kind of math
are you doing?

353
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,832
The kind of math
that says Jessica Pearson

354
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,668
hiring Louis Litt back
adds up to shady.

355
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,743
If that's all you've got,
you can collect your favor

356
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,306
when the clock strikes
kiss my ass,

357
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,608
because partners leave firms
and come back all the time.

358
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,544
Maybe, but they don't come back
with their name on the wall.

359
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,614
Ah, I'm guessing he wasn't
supposed to tell me that.

360
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:59,851
But he did, and Louis Litt
is not name partner material,

361
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:02,187
which means he must have
something on you.

362
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,289
So unless you want me
going around town

363
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,224
flapping my big mouth
that something isn't right

364
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:10,261
in your kitchen, you're gonna
make good on that favor.

365
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:12,130
Sylvia didn't slip up at all,
did she?

366
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,164
No, she didn't.

367
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:15,199
You have your girl Friday;
I have mine.

368
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:17,101
But you can still tell her
how nice her hair looks

369
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,236
on the way out.

370
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,903
I'll be in touch.

371
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,076
Oh, you're tapping out already?

372
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,111
I thought you'd have
a lot more backbone than that.

373
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,814
I'm not tapping out.

374
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,082
I finished all of the work--

375
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,750
Which I expected to be done
an hour ago.

376
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:36,520
Come on, Louis, you didn't
expect it to be done at all.

377
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,122
Just like
you didn't expect this.

378
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,457
What the hell is that?

379
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,125
It's a gift certificate.

380
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
What, are you trying
to bribe me now?

381
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,930
It's not a bribe,
it's a reminder.

382
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:51,734
Look, the gift certificate is
from Peter's Steak House,

383
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,770
the place that you and I saved
together.

384
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:54,904
And after we saved it,

385
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,906
you told me that
we had something in common.

386
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,907
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

387
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:58,941
Yes, you do,

388
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,176
because what we had
in common

389
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,245
was a love of the law.

390
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,600
You told me that
when you asked me

391
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:08,651
to be your associate, Louis,
and I am still the same person.

392
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,886
And if I found out a woman
I had something in common with

393
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,888
was actually a man,
I wouldn't keep seeing her.

394
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:15,424
Okay, what I did is not at all
the same thing.

395
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,459
No, it's worse.

396
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:18,894
You say you love the law
so much,

397
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,763
but every single case
you've ever touched is tainted.

398
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,932
So you get exposed,
Peter's gets bulldozed.

399
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,101
It wouldn't even be there
to get bulldozed

400
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,603
if you and I hadn't
worked together.

401
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,470
All right, genius.
You want to work together?

402
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,906
You love the law so much?

403
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,409
You're gonna memorize
every case that I've ever done.

404
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:35,443
Louis.

405
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,477
No, get to work,

406
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,313
and use that magnificent
memory of yours

407
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,347
for something more than

408
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,048
bullshitting
your way through life.

409
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,725
We have a problem.

410
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,594
Unless it's urgent,
I don't have the time.

411
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:54,494
Louis is telling people.

412
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,429
What people?

413
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,788
For starters, Robert Zane.

414
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,991
Why the hell is Louis even
talking to Robert Zane?

415
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,293
I asked him to hire Louis
after we took back VersaLife.

416
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,861
And you didn't think to tell me
that after last night?

417
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,129
I was handling it.

418
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,932
From what I can tell,
you handled it like shit.

419
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,033
So this is my fault?

420
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,347
Well, it sure as hell
isn't mine.

421
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,568
You know what, Jessica,
I'm not the one

422
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,803
who wanted to fire Louis,

423
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,705
and I'm not the one who wanted
to deny him clients.

424
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,041
I did that because of
his performance as an attorney.

425
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:18,277
You antagonized him for years
for your own pleasure.

426
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,611
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

427
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,313
You handed out
your share of abuse.

428
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,015
Tell yourself
whatever you want.

429
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,350
You're the one who hired a fraud
and gave Louis leverage.

430
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,985
And I told you
Louis would get worse,

431
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,180
and you said
I had to take it.

432
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,754
Well, I don't care whose fault
it is,

433
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,823
he is getting worse,
and I'm not gonna take it.

434
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,959
Oh, yes, you are.

435
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,294
You're going to take it,

436
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,162
and you're gonna do it
with a smile on your face

437
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,664
until I say otherwise.

438
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,733
And what the hell
are you gonna do?

439
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,102
I'm going to clean up this mess
once and for all.

440
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:48,973
What do you mean,
you don't have

441
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,441
diamond-encrusted
business cards?

442
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,076
Fine, what about
the embossed ivory?

443
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,378
Okay, great, well, how much
would 10,000 of those run me?

444
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,414
Money's no object.

445
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,248
What, are you crazy?
I'm not paying that much.

446
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,683
Unless it comes
with a reach-around.

447
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,618
Which, by the way,
I'm still not paying that much.

448
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,020
Elite Printing, my ass.

449
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,024
I give you
one simple instruction--

450
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,827
to keep your mouth shut--
and you couldn't even do that.

451
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,230
Um, okay, did you make
an appointment with Norma?

452
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,531
- What?
- To see me.

453
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:18,534
Did you check
with my secretary, Norma?

454
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,370
Cut the shit, Louis.
I'm not in the mood.

455
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,638
Well, get in the mood,
because I hold all the cards.

456
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,707
And those cards are getting you
your name on the wall,

457
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:25,976
but you need
to keep this to yourself.

458
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,043
Why?

459
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,511
So you can figure out a way
to screw me?

460
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:29,912
I gave you my word.

461
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:33,815
Well, no disrespect, Jessica,
but your word means shit.

462
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,750
So if you want me
to stop telling people,

463
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:39,288
you better start
telling people yourself.

464
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,889
I told you, in good time.

465
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:44,326
And I just told you
I don't give a shit.

466
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,062
So I suggest you call a meeting
with the senior partners.

467
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,397
Those meetings are
on Thursdays.

468
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,731
Well, consider today Thursday.

469
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,834
I told you, I have yet
to figure out how to sell it.

470
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,037
You want to sell it?
I'll tell you how to sell it.

471
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,872
You and Harvey do it together,

472
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:59,875
you do it like you mean it.
and you do it now.

473
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,576
Got it? Good.

474
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,083
I'm sure
you've all heard rumors

475
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:11,752
about why we called
this meeting,

476
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,755
but that's because it's hard
to keep good news quiet.

477
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,657
We'll be making this official
later this week

478
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:21,327
but we're here to announce
our newest name partner,

479
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:24,664
Louis Litt.

480
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,603
Thank you, Jessica.

481
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:33,373
Harvey.

482
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,776
Some of you may be wondering
how this happened.

483
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,478
There's a simple explanation,

484
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:41,881
and all it requires is for me
to admit something.

485
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,308
I made a mistake.

486
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:50,112
I never should have accepted
Louis's resignation,

487
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,247
because not only is he
a billing machine

488
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,781
and a damn good attorney,

489
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,351
he has personally gotten me
out of more than one jam,

490
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,886
and there's no one
I'd rather have my name next to

491
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,124
than my friend Louis Litt.

492
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:05,093
Thank you, Harvey.

493
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:09,163
Even though it's "not official,"
I already feel like

494
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,731
my name's been up there
as long as yours.

495
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,568
And I definitely feel like

496
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:19,573
it's gonna be up there
for a long, long time.

497
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,180
A lot of good that did.

498
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,481
Leave it to Louis to take
his big moment like a dick.

499
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:29,516
Harvey, calm down.

500
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,517
Calm down?

501
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,118
I just did exactly
what he wanted,

502
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,113
and he acted like a dick,
and he's not gonna stop.

503
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:36,789
He's not gonna stop because
you didn't do what he wanted.

504
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:39,058
Jessica, I just got up there
and kissed his ass

505
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:40,460
in front of
the entire partnership

506
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:41,661
and pretended to like it.

507
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,795
Exactly.

508
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:43,829
Pretended.

509
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,498
Oh, you want me
to actually like it?

510
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,333
I want you to make him
feel accepted.

511
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:49,535
Jessica.

512
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,537
Harvey, what Louis wants
is to be accepted.

513
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:52,731
And like it or not,
the person

514
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,406
he wants that from
the most is you.

515
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,341
So you're gonna go to him,
you're gonna make nice,

516
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:59,078
and that's how we're gonna
put all of this to bed.

517
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:00,913
You want to tell me
what the hell that was?

518
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:03,082
If you'll excuse me,

519
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,217
I'm gonna let Jessica handle
this conversation.

520
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,819
I have to go kill myself.

521
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,257
Jeff, I can't do this
right now.

522
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,458
Should I make an appointment?

523
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,627
Because the partners may have
bought that fairy tale

524
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:18,363
about Louis's triumphant return,
but they don't know what I know.

525
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:19,398
What exactly is that?

526
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,433
That Louis committed a crime,

527
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:23,702
and then he resigned
five seconds

528
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,470
before you were
about to fire him.

529
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:29,774
And now he's not only back,
he's name partner.

530
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,877
I reconsidered,
which, as managing partner,

531
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,045
I am entitled to do.

532
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,215
And as someone with a brain,
I'm entitled

533
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,485
to come to the conclusion
that Louis has something on you.

534
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,156
Jeff, you said you didn't
want me to lie to you anymore,

535
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,591
and I'm trying
like hell not to.

536
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,259
And that's the same thing
as lying to me.

537
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,293
No, it's not.

538
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,329
Oh, you are one hell of
a lawyer.

539
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:54,999
So are you,
which is why you're here.

540
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,835
So I'll come clean.

541
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:59,570
I can't tell you the truth
about this,

542
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:03,040
and that's as honest as
I can be with you right now.

543
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,709
Can you handle that?

544
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,812
I can handle it for now.

545
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,547
But I won't handle it
forever.

546
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:21,158
Louis, what are you doing here?

547
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,426
I noticed you haven't
congratulated me yet,

548
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,328
so I wanted to give you
a chance to make up for it.

549
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,397
Right, congratulations.
We're all so happy for you.

550
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:28,431
Is that what you wanted?

551
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,133
Seemed a little disingenuous.

552
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,301
Then let me be clear.

553
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,602
I don't mean a word of it.

554
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:35,638
You really want to talk that way
to a new name partner?

555
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:37,039
I'm talking to you that way

556
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:39,308
because you threatened to throw
the man that I love in jail

557
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:40,777
to become
that name partner.

558
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:41,911
So, you know what, Louis,

559
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:43,445
I'm sorry
that I didn't bake you a cake.

560
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
That's too bad.

561
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:45,714
You didn't do anything for me,

562
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:48,484
but I got something for you.

563
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:49,585
Doc review.

564
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,520
Filings to be done
in triplicate.

565
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:54,757
Paralegal work,
since you like doing it so much.

566
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,226
You know I don't like doing it
at all.

567
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:00,028
You helped your boyfriend
with his work.

568
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,330
You didn't think
I'd figure that out?

569
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,699
You know what?
I don't care.

570
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:05,000
You have no authority over me.

571
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,735
I'm Harvey's associate.

572
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,570
Yeah, but I run the associates.

573
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:11,006
Therefore, I run you.

574
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,708
I know what you're doing.

575
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,510
But do you know
what you're doing?

576
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:15,864
Not only do you live
with a fraud,

577
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,212
you're just like him--

578
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:18,886
pretending to be a lawyer
when you're not.

579
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:20,282
I'm not pretending
to be anything.

580
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,283
I am in law school.

581
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:22,717
Are you really gonna make it
through?

582
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,218
You could barely handle
the LSATs.

583
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:25,620
You couldn't get into Harvard.

584
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:27,888
As a matter of fact,
your boyfriend may be a fraud,

585
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,824
but he's a better lawyer
than you'll ever be.

586
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,560
You have no idea what kind of
lawyer I'm gonna be.

587
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,195
Don't I?

588
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,897
You learned from
the best liars around, Rachel:

589
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:40,568
Harvey, Mike,

590
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:42,937
your father.

591
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:47,709
Yeah, I know exactly the kind of
lawyer you're gonna be.

592
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:51,212
But until that day,
this kind of work

593
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,946
is all you're good for.

594
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:01,694
So you like marinated meat?

595
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:02,789
Oh, yum.

596
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:04,458
Okay, wait,
but which one do you make?

597
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:05,925
Kansas City or Memphis style?

598
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,794
Oh, hell, when it comes to ribs,

599
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,796
I make 'em
every which way I can.

600
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:13,633
I am now officially starving.

601
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,502
- Harvey.
- Please have a seat.

602
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:17,738
Don't let my law firm get in
the way of your coffee klatch.

603
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,438
Oh, now, now,
don't blame Donna here.

604
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,374
I told her you and I had
some unfinished business.

605
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:22,775
Already?

606
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,478
What, did you pick something
out of your generic favor file?

607
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:28,180
I've never done anything generic
in my life.

608
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:30,949
This favor is tailor-made
for you.

609
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,218
It's very specific
and very personal.

610
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:35,354
We're in a little dispute
with another firm.

611
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,122
I need you to get them
to back off of it.

612
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:38,424
Why can't you do it yourself?

613
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,259
'Cause I don't know the lawyer
on the other side.

614
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,327
You do.
Good luck.

615
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,918
What the hell
is he talking about?

616
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,199
- It's Scottie.
- Aw, shit.

617
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,333
I know.

618
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,968
Scottie doesn't do favors
like this,

619
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,403
and I don't have any leverage
on her.

620
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:53,305
Yeah, you do.

621
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,107
You're just not gonna
like using it.

622
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,271
Hey, there you are.

623
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,426
Look, I just finished memorizing
all of Louis's cases,

624
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,142
and I had an idea
I wanted to run by--

625
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,744
Rachel, what happened?

626
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,181
Nothing happened.

627
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,081
What did Louis do?

628
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,684
It's nothing.

629
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,352
He found out that I helped you,

630
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,086
and now he's giving me
paralegal work,

631
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,689
and I was a little upset,
but now I'm okay.

632
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,989
You weren't just
a little upset.

633
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,291
You were crying,

634
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,092
and a little paralegal work
wouldn't do that.

635
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,127
It is not important.

636
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,094
And you know what?
I had it coming.

637
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,196
You had it coming?

638
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,431
What are you--
Rachel, what did he do?

639
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,965
Mike, I was the one that
told you to make up with him.

640
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,434
- Rachel.
- I helped you with the work.

641
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,535
- What did he do?
- And you know what?

642
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:32,536
I lied to him
as much as you did.

643
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,770
What did he do?

644
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:40,243
It's not what he did,
it's what he said.

645
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:41,277
What did he say?

646
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,012
Mike, I'm a big girl,

647
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,480
and I can take care of Louis.

648
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:45,614
This isn't about you,

649
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,683
this is about me and him,

650
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,452
and I'm gonna make him
remember that.

651
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:56,054
You piece of shit.

652
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,456
You said this was
between me and you.

653
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,590
It is between me and you.

654
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,144
No, it stopped being
between me and you

655
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,291
the second you went to Rachel.

656
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:02,326
You put her between us

657
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,594
the second you went to her
to help you.

658
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,728
God, are you insane?

659
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,598
Rachel has never been
anything but kind to you.

660
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,066
I can't even count
the amount of times

661
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,200
that she defended you.

662
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:12,002
And now, she tries to help me
just a little bit,

663
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:13,704
and you rip her to pieces.

664
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:16,206
No, that's not the help
I'm talking about, fraud.

665
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,241
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

666
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:20,978
You went to her to help you
lie to me about who you are,

667
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:23,714
and like the good little lackey
that she is,

668
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:25,883
she came to me
and lied to my face.

669
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,884
She did it to protect me,
Louis.

670
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:28,918
Well, good for you,

671
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,019
but when I found out about it,

672
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,821
I felt like shit
for the 180th time.

673
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:33,490
So I just went to her
and did the same thing.

674
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:39,261
You know, Louis,
I've just been memorizing

675
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:42,431
all of your old arguments.

676
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:45,401
I was actually gonna try
and come in here

677
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:47,871
and use one of them
to change your mind about me.

678
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:49,739
- It won't work.
- Oh, I know.

679
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:54,209
Because while I am the same
person that I was before,

680
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:55,343
you're not.

681
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,980
You're right.

682
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,549
I'm not the same person.

683
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:01,884
I used to be
a man of my word,

684
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:03,918
but you people taught me
that doesn't mean a thing.

685
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,654
So when I told you

686
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:08,724
it was between me and you,
I lied.

687
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:11,092
I found your weak spot,

688
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,461
and you know what
I'm gonna do?

689
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:15,697
I'm gonna keep hammering on her

690
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,933
until you break.

691
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,675
Jessica.

692
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:36,611
Please, if it can wait,
I've had a long day,

693
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:37,812
and I need to go home.

694
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,846
Too bad.

695
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,080
You're staying here

696
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:44,619
and drafting Louis Litt's
new partnership agreement.

697
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,354
So now you're piling on too now?

698
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,055
I'm not piling on.

699
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,925
I am giving you this
because it's non-billable work

700
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:55,129
and the only reason
it exists is because of you.

701
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,932
This again?

702
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:58,966
Excuse me?

703
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,635
You heard me.

704
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,337
I've seen this movie before.

705
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,438
And the reason
it keeps rerunning

706
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,473
is because every time
I think I'm done with you,

707
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:10,210
you and your dirty little secret
rear your ugly heads.

708
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,244
You know what, Jessica?

709
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:12,646
I have had it up to here

710
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,014
with you saying that this is
my dirty little secret.

711
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,384
You could have fired me when
you found out, and you didn't.

712
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,185
No, you decided to keep me
around

713
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,520
because you were more concerned

714
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,956
with beating Daniel Hardman
and keeping your power.

715
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,324
And then you kept me around

716
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,925
because you didn't want to
lose Harvey.

717
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,294
And then you wanted to use
my secret to beat Harvey,

718
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:30,397
and then again
and again and again.

719
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,366
So please, Jessica,
why don't you tell me,

720
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,602
when the hell does this become
your dirty little secret?

721
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,386
This seat taken?

722
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:57,523
Hi.

723
00:27:57,557 --> 00:27:59,092
Hey.

724
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,627
Since your message
was so cryptic,

725
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:03,696
I'm assuming
this is about business.

726
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,198
I need a favor.

727
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:08,166
Hey, Scottie.

728
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,301
How are you?

729
00:28:09,335 --> 00:28:11,136
How have you been
since you left?

730
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,138
I heard that
you took some time off.

731
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:14,373
Where did you land?

732
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:16,942
I need you to settle your case
against Robert Zane.

733
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:18,143
And why would I do that?

734
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:19,445
Because I owe him one.

735
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:23,215
Harvey, I'm just getting
back on my feet at a new firm.

736
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,183
This case is winnable.

737
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:28,421
The firm knows that it is
because I told them it is.

738
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:29,789
I settle,
I look like shit.

739
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,557
I know that,
but you came to me once

740
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,426
to take it easy on you
with Folsom Foods--

741
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,694
Because you said if I was ever
in trouble personally--

742
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:38,062
I am in trouble personally.

743
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,231
What the hell is personal
about Robert Zane?

744
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,566
You don't do this for me,

745
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,669
Zane's going to put it together
about Mike Ross.

746
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:54,779
Scottie.

747
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,681
You selfish son of a bitch.

748
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,115
You said you told me that

749
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,418
because you didn't want to keep
lying to the people you love.

750
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:01,453
I didn't want to.

751
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,020
And now you come to me
trading on the fact

752
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,255
that I know to get you
out of a jam

753
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,023
for doing something
stupid and selfish

754
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,124
that drove a wedge between us

755
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,439
before we ever even
had a chance.

756
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,693
I told you the truth.

757
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:10,928
After it was too late.

758
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:11,963
Scottie.

759
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:14,631
I loved you.

760
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:19,337
I loved you,

761
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:23,140
and you let some stupid secret
that I would never tell anyone

762
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:27,945
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

763
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
You're right, Scottie.

764
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:32,516
I don't have a leg to stand on.

765
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,753
But if you don't do this for me,
I am in trouble.

766
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:47,897
I'm going to recommend
we settle with Robert Zane.

767
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:48,931
Thank you.

768
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:50,100
But to be clear,

769
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,235
you get to ask me this once.

770
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,137
And I never want to hear
the name Mike Ross again.

771
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,171
Scottie--

772
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,473
Once.

773
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:17,226
You wanted it to be official.

774
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
There it is, Louis.

775
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,296
It's official.

776
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:24,199
So that's it?

777
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:26,368
People are just gonna walk in
here tomorrow morning

778
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,871
like it's any other day
and see it or maybe not see it?

779
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:29,906
What were you expecting?

780
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:31,641
A ceremony and a brass band?

781
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:32,909
We don't do that.

782
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:35,578
Well, I'm name partner,
and I say we do now.

783
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:37,046
Excuse me?

784
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,914
You heard me.

785
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:42,251
I want pomp and circumstance
in the form of an unveiling.

786
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,119
I'm going home, Louis.

787
00:30:44,154 --> 00:30:45,587
I'm not spending
the rest of the night

788
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,156
emailing invitations
to an unveiling.

789
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,323
You're going home?

790
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,125
Well, then I'll send them out
myself.

791
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,927
Because tomorrow...

792
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,062
This is happening.

793
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:54,196
4:00 p.m. sharp.

794
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,431
I have a meeting at 4:00.

795
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:59,234
Then reschedule it.

796
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:01,537
You don't want me
to reschedule.

797
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:04,805
What you want is
to know you've earned that.

798
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,908
I have earned it,

799
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:09,610
but I want you to know it.

800
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:10,878
Okay, here it is.

801
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,880
You got your name up there
by finding leverage

802
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,949
and using it to strong-arm me
into doing something

803
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:16,317
that I never would have done.

804
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,351
See, I knew you--

805
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:18,553
Let me finish.

806
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,655
It was a stone-cold move,

807
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,692
and it's exactly what Harvey
would have done.

808
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:26,961
Now, if that doesn't tell you
that you've earned it,

809
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,662
then I don't know what will.

810
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,401
You still want me to reschedule
my meeting?

811
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,435
Yes, I do.

812
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,038
Fine. I'll be there.

813
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:40,107
You and Harvey.

814
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,342
Of course, Louis.

815
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:45,345
We're your partners.

816
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:50,183
Jesus, you look like shit.

817
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,418
What's going on?

818
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,954
Between drafting Louis's
partnership agreement

819
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:57,423
for Jessica and Louis's
never-ending onslaught,

820
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,058
I didn't get any sleep.

821
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,533
Well, splash some water
on your face,

822
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,161
'cause we have to go to
his debutante ball

823
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:03,229
and look like we give a shit.

824
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:04,396
No. I'm not going.

825
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:05,751
What do you mean
you're not going?

826
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:07,333
Now is not the time
to poke the bear.

827
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,367
It's too late.

828
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:09,636
The bear is an asshole,

829
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,403
and he's not just taking it out
on me anymore.

830
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:12,872
- He's taking it out on Rachel.
- What?

831
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,774
Yeah, he made it clear
that he found the weak spot

832
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,542
that's going to get to me,
and he's gonna keep

833
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:18,878
pressing it and pressing it
until I can't take it anymore.

834
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,647
Mike, you are not ringing
that bell.

835
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:22,481
You're damn right
I'm not ringing that bell.

836
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:25,018
But if I have to go raise
a glass to that son of a bitch,

837
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:27,552
I'm gonna end up
smashing it over his head.

838
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,623
Come with me.

839
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,658
What are you going to do?

840
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,627
Enough is enough.

841
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,662
Harvey.

842
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,130
You're just in time.

843
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,698
Jessica's on her way down
with the partnership agreement.

844
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:40,932
You here to be my witness?

845
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,401
He's here to keep me
from ripping your face off.

846
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:44,995
Oh, I see.
Now that big brother's here--

847
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,304
Okay, that's enough.

848
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,839
Louis, you got everything
you wanted,

849
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,374
and you are done
taking it out on him,

850
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,109
because no matter what you do,
I'm not letting him quit.

851
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,678
- Then I'll just fire him.
- You can't.

852
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:55,480
I can, and I will,

853
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:57,282
because Jessica would rather
he be fired

854
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:58,550
than you all go to jail.

855
00:32:58,584 --> 00:32:59,917
No one's going to jail.

856
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,752
See?
She knows what's what.

857
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:04,021
I sign the agreement,
he's done,

858
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:05,856
and then I bring Katrina back
as my associate.

859
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:07,425
And that's not going
to happen.

860
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:08,693
What are you talking about?

861
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:09,887
Louis, I'm afraid you've made

862
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,729
your last dictate to me
as name partner.

863
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:13,798
I'm not gonna let you
take this away from me.

864
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:15,433
I'm not taking anything away
from you.

865
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,134
You are still name partner.

866
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,436
Right after you sign this.

867
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,573
I added a little something extra
after you finished drafting it.

868
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:25,075
This says I'm co-conspirator
to hiring a fraud.

869
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,109
You are.

870
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,377
You became one

871
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,846
the second you used him
to get your name on the door.

872
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,914
I know I'm not a real lawyer,

873
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:32,816
but that sounds like
he is to me.

874
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,318
I am a real lawyer.

875
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:36,720
He is.

876
00:33:36,754 --> 00:33:37,754
I'm not signing it.

877
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:38,922
Louis, here's the thing.

878
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:41,124
I told you not to tell anybody
about this,

879
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:43,493
and then you went and
you shouted it to Robert Zane,

880
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:45,128
and then you made me
tell the partners.

881
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:47,463
And the capper is,
there are about a hundred people

882
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:48,765
waiting to greet you

883
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,934
after the unveiling
you arranged,

884
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:54,003
which won't happen
if you don't sign that.

885
00:33:57,574 --> 00:33:59,308
I could still go to the police.

886
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:02,278
Yeah, you could,
but you won't.

887
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:03,747
'Cause you used
that little secret

888
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:05,915
to get where you are right now.

889
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,552
It was the only bullet
in your chamber,

890
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,520
and I am taking your gun away.

891
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:12,555
You set me up.

892
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:13,656
You set yourself up,

893
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,625
just like you did
with Charles Forstman.

894
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,159
And what I learned from him was,

895
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:18,727
once you get something
that you want,

896
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:21,529
you will do whatever it takes
to keep it.

897
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:25,367
So why don't you go ahead
and sign

898
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:28,871
so we can get out
to your goddamn party.

899
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:48,246
You know, it's funny.

900
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,582
We've never had a ceremony
when we've changed names before,

901
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:55,585
but Louis Litt had the audacity
to convene us all here today.

902
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,955
And as it turns out,
his first decision

903
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,391
as name partner is brilliant,

904
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,926
because a ceremony like this
gives us a chance

905
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:07,964
to reevaluate where we've been
and where we're going.

906
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:09,966
Perhaps you had a disagreement
with a colleague,

907
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,803
or there's some other issue
that's been on your mind.

908
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:17,474
The point is, with a new name
comes a new beginning.

909
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:21,109
For me, I'm hoping
we can see this as a chance

910
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:22,911
to wipe the slate clean.

911
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:25,914
With that said,

912
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:29,418
here's to our newest
name partner, Louis Litt.

913
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:36,925
Nice speech.

914
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,627
Let's hope it takes.

915
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:39,982
It's got a better chance
of taking

916
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,830
now that you made him sign
the agreement.

917
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:43,831
That it does.

918
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:45,032
Speaking of which,

919
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,001
when exactly did you know
you were gonna do that?

920
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:51,105
Oh, um, about 15 seconds
after Donna told me he knew.

921
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:53,241
And you didn't feel the need
to bring me in on that plan?

922
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:54,442
I felt the exact opposite.

923
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:55,556
What are you talking about?

924
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:57,745
Harvey, Louis wanted
to see you suffer.

925
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:59,647
If I had told you,
you would have had to fake it,

926
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,082
and you're a shitty actor.

927
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:03,250
Excuse me, but I can act.

928
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:06,286
No, everybody thinks
they can act, Harvey.

929
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,889
The fact of the matter is, well,
you're just a pretty face.

930
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:10,691
Oh, you think I'm pretty?

931
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,492
Pretty stupid.

932
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:25,639
I can't believe
it's actually up there.

933
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:29,710
This firm is changing names
more than Prince.

934
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:32,546
Who?

935
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,981
You're kidding, right?

936
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:36,350
<i>Purple Rain.</i>

937
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:37,451
<i>Raspberry Beret.</i>

938
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:38,985
I'm kidding.

939
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:42,756
I almost had to reevaluate
our entire relationship.

940
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,325
Mm-hmm, after you were gonna go
and beat Louis up for me?

941
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,694
I doubt that.

942
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:53,232
Mike, thank you.

943
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,567
It just seemed right.

944
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,269
After all, you stood up
to Louis for me.

945
00:36:56,303 --> 00:37:01,374
Mm-hmm, and I almost
got pummeled for it.

946
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:03,309
That took guts.

947
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:07,412
And that's why I love you.

948
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:09,748
I love you too.

949
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:14,153
I wanted to tell you
that you were right.

950
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:16,755
I started this whole thing
by hiring Mike.

951
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,023
It's my fault.

952
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,592
Thank you.

953
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,828
But I've been on board
long enough,

954
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:25,063
and it's time
I accepted the fact

955
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,499
that it's my secret too.

956
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,367
So where do we go from here?

957
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:31,568
We fight like
hell to protect it.

958
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:43,314
No cake?

959
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:46,450
What are you doing here,
Jessica?

960
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:49,253
I know you're tired of waiting
for an explanation,

961
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:51,155
so I'm here to give you one.

962
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,591
You've given me explanations
before.

963
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:57,461
I want the truth.

964
00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:59,730
Are you ready for the truth?

965
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:02,199
Because it's not pretty.

966
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,335
There's only one way
to find out.

967
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,773
It seems like forever ago,

968
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:12,843
but it wasn't that long ago
at all.

969
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:21,617
Daniel Hardman embezzled money
from the firm,

970
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:24,153
and I covered it up.

971
00:38:24,187 --> 00:38:26,288
Now, make no mistake,

972
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:28,524
I found about it,
I confronted him,

973
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,694
and I eventually made him
pay it all back.

974
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,464
But I did cover it up.

975
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:39,469
From the partners,
from the police, from everyone.

976
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:44,039
I even adjusted our books
to hide the crime.

977
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,941
And being a bloodhound
about these things,

978
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:48,744
Louis found out

979
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:54,016
and used it
as leverage to come back.

980
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,784
As name partner.

981
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:57,419
As name partner.

982
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:02,358
Why couldn't you trust me
with that before?

983
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:07,096
Because I didn't know
how you'd react,

984
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,334
and I didn't want to risk losing
everything I had.

985
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:26,615
Jessica,

986
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,550
your secret is safe with me.

987
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,560
You're late.

988
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,861
But I come bearing gifts.

989
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:43,163
Huh.
That doesn't look like cannoli.

990
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:44,598
It's better than cannoli, Dad.

991
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,400
It's the résumé
of your new associate.

992
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:48,001
If this is Harvey's way of
trying to make up

993
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:49,556
for the fact
that I didn't hire Louis--

994
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,306
This isn't from Harvey.
It's from me.

995
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,874
And you're going to do this
for me,

996
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:56,143
and I am not going to owe you
a thing.

997
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:57,978
This is what they're
teaching you at Columbia?

998
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,480
Because that's not how
favors work.

999
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:01,748
I know how favors work.

1000
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,950
You do this, and then you want
something from me someday.

1001
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,653
But by then
you're going to understand

1002
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:09,923
that right now
I'm the one doing you a favor,

1003
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:14,594
because Katrina Bennett
is an amazing lawyer.

1004
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:15,995
I was wrong about you.

1005
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:19,499
You're not like your mother.

1006
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,869
You're like your father.

1007
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,938
Come on.

1008
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,473
- Oh, that's good.
- That was a good one.

1009
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,640
That was a good one.

1010
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,608
Sounds just like me,
baby girl.

1011
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:31,743
I had you fooled, huh?

1012
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:33,211
You did.

1013
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:35,380
Now let me show you
how a lawyer cooks.

1014
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:43,922
What do you want?

1015
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:45,824
I just thought
you'd want this.

1016
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,392
The associates saved it
for you.

1017
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:48,627
No, they didn't.

1018
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:50,061
You saved it for me
because you want to pretend

1019
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,329
to be my friend again.

1020
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:52,998
Louis, didn't you hear
Jessica's speech?

1021
00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:54,592
This is our chance
wipe the slate clean.

1022
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:56,034
I did hear her speech,

1023
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:59,504
and I know that she sent you
here to say that to me.

1024
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:00,538
No one sent me here.

1025
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:02,173
I'm here
because I want to be here.

1026
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,410
You see, that's sweet.

1027
00:41:05,444 --> 00:41:08,613
But how can I ever believe
a word you say?

1028
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:12,317
I want to know
if you ever thought once

1029
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:15,420
to tell me the truth about Mike.

1030
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:17,155
No, I didn't.

1031
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:18,523
Of course you didn't.

1032
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,358
- Because we're not friends.
- You're wrong.

1033
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:21,759
We are friends,

1034
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,496
but my professional loyalty
to Harvey comes above that,

1035
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,364
which is why
I never told anyone--

1036
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:30,434
Jessica, Rachel, anyone.

1037
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:32,169
So put yourself in my position

1038
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:34,804
and ask yourself,
what you would have done?

1039
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,476
I want you to tell me
something else.

1040
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:42,979
Yes. Anything.

1041
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,314
You ever sleep with Harvey?

1042
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:46,350
Wait. What?

1043
00:41:46,384 --> 00:41:48,985
It's not
a professional question.

1044
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,088
It's a personal question.

1045
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:53,457
Can you put our so-called
friendship high enough

1046
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,659
to answer that one honestly?

1047
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:56,760
Louis--

1048
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,529
Because it's the only thing
I can think of

1049
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:01,898
to know if I can even begin
to trust you again.

1050
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:07,503
Once.

1051
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:09,472
That's my way of wiping
the slate clean.

1052
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:11,541
You can accept it or not.

1053
