.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,486
- There's no violation
with us seeing each other.

4
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:06,350
- This isn't something that I am
trying to get away with.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,546
It's something
I'm feeling inside.

6
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:09,279
- My son was up for parole
next month.

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,705
He wouldn't have gotten
into a fight.

8
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,538
- There's got to be
at least 20 complaints

9
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,003
of prisoners being denied
their release date.

10
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:15,528
- And every one of them
involves injuries

11
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,591
and some kind of vague
disciplinary action.

12
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:20,620
- If our firm is in any way
associated with that case,

13
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,414
we lose a huge client.
- I'm not working on it.

14
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,308
- Then you're gonna put that
in writing.

15
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:25,643
You have nothing to do
with this case.

16
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:27,706
- My job requires
a reputation for discretion.

17
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:29,300
- He'll never tell a soul,

18
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,397
and your business
will stay intact.

19
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,260
- You lived a lie for years.

20
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:34,552
You can't keep a secret
about working one goddamn case?

21
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:36,416
- We have a job
we'd like to offer you.

22
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,379
- I don't do business
with people I don't trust.

23
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,406
- You can help these people.

24
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,533
- I want $50,000.

25
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:41,967
- Oliver, it's me. I'm in.

26
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:43,294
- What about your promise
to Harvey?

27
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:44,758
- You let me worry about Harvey.

28
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,401
- Hey.

29
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,195
Wait, you're leaving?

30
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,929
Why didn't you wake me?

31
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,348
- 'Cause you still have an hour
before your alarm goes off.

32
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:05,546
- It's 6:30.
Where are you going?

33
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:07,868
There's no way you have
something this early for Harvey.

34
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,901
- I got something
at the clinic with Oliver.

35
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,164
He needs my help with a case.

36
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,128
- Wait.

37
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,508
I was hoping we could
have dinner tonight.

38
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,169
- I probably have to meet
with Oliver tonight, too.

39
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,362
- Well, then why don't you
ask Harvey for some time off

40
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,555
to take care
of what you're working on?

41
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,119
- He's already letting me
go back and forth.

42
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,385
I don't wanna take advantage.

43
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,850
- Mike, I'm just worried
about you

44
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:33,540
burning the candle at both ends.

45
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,135
- Yeah.

46
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,135
We talked about it last night.

47
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:41,124
It's not gonna last forever.
I promise.

48
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,819
- Okay.

49
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,078

Oliver, I can't be here all day.

53
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:01,206
So let's get down to it.
What do you got?

54
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:04,036
- I've got us a meeting
in Brooklyn with Marc Stevens.

55
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,302
- Who's Marc Stevens?

56
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,295
- He is plaintiff number 18
in our class.

57
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,258
We're meeting him at nine.
- Great.

58
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,381
That'll give us time
to come up with our cover story.

59

- Mike, I know you're
not technically allowed

00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,338
to work on this, but no one
here is gonna rat you out.

61
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:18,168
- It's not a technicality.
Oliver, we've been over this.

62
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,732
Me working on this case
means the whole thing

63
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,730
could get tossed out.

64
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,354
- I get it.

65
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:24,287
There's only two people
in the loop, me and you.

66
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:26,250
- Exactly.
So if Nathan asks...

67
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,675
- Nathan asks what?

68
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,140
- Nathan.

69
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:31,203
- I was just telling Oliver

70
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,997
that if you get sick
of seeing me around here,

71
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,990
then he's gonna have
to tell you too bad,

72
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:37,123
'cause I am not gonna let
the Brooklyn Housing Project

73
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,216
keep bullying its tenants.

74
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:41,049
- You can't handle
the BHP on your own?

75
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,969
- I can, but it's nice
having Mike give me some backup.

76
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,235
- Good.

77
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:47,099
Tell you the truth,
after you made me sign

78
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,959
that conflict of interest waiver
on Oliver's prison case,

79
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,481
I didn't think you'd be
around here that much at all.

80
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:01,130
- Is there anything left for me?

81
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,323
- No, you slept in late so you
missed me making you breakfast.

82
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,117
- I see, but for the record,

83
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,180
heating up Pop-Tarts
isn't making me breakfast.

84
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:08,944
- Well, how 'bout
I make it up to you

85
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:10,309
and not take you out to lunch?

86
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,601
- I appreciate
the non-invitation,

87
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,236
but I can't today.

88
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,589
- Come on, why not?
- I have an appointment.

89
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:18,890
- Since when do you see
patients at lunch?

90
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,883
- It isn't with
a patient, Harvey.

91
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,209
It's actually with my lawyer.

92
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,912
- What do you mean, your lawyer?

93
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,269
- It's nothing.
It's a nuisance suit

94
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,832
from an ex-business partner.

95
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,198
- Well, who's handling it
for you?

96
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,823
- I hope you're not
about to suggest

97
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,128
that you handle it for me.

98
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,182
- I'm not, but I can get you
to the next best person.

99
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:35,544
- And does this person
have a name?

100
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,008
- Louis Litt.

101
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,802
- The one you punched
in the face?

102
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,067
- Paula, he's the best man
for the job.

103
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,931
I'm telling you,
Louis is a pit bull.

104
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,226
- And who says
I want a pit bull?

105
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:44,821
- Listen to me,
if whatever this thing is,

106
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:46,485
it's reached the level
of a lawsuit,

107
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:47,950
you're gonna need
a lawyer like Louis

108
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,515
whether you like it or not.

109
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,807
- Well, I appreciate
your concern, Harvey,

110
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,800
but I prefer
to handle this myself.

111
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,763
But if you still want to help,

112
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,099
why don't you buy me
a new box of Pop-Tarts?

113
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,219
Any flavor will do,
as long as it's strawberry.

114
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,770
- It was total bullshit.

115
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,174
- Are you saying you didn't
get in a fight at all?

116
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:08,769
- No, I got in a fight,

117
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,463
but it was only to stay alive.

118
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:12,755
- Just tell us what happened.
We're on your side.

119
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:13,921
- Look, I was two months
from getting out, okay?

120
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,447
I was gonna keep my head down

121
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:17,150
every single day until I walked.

122
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:19,005
Next thing I know,
some big-ass son of a bitch

123
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:21,705
is on top of me, and I'm
the one that gets extra time?

124
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:22,731
- What was his name?
- I don't know, man.

125
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,694
I have no idea.

126
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:26,388
- Look, Marc, I don't know
if you're afraid of payback

127
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,883
or something, but we need to
know everything if we're gonna...

128
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,817
- I'm not afraid
of no payback, okay?

129
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:31,112
I don't know who he was.

130
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,844
And if I knew, I would tell you.

131
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,696
Look, that place
took two years of my life.

132
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,357
Two extra years on top of
the two for stealing a few TVs.

133
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,649
If you're going after them,
then I want in on this.

134
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,175
- Then you're in,
but I was in prison

135
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,809
an even shorter time than you,
and I still knew

136
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,772
all the guys' names
on my cellblock.

137
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:50,895
So either he was new to yours
or you were new to his.

138
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,928
Either way,
I need to know what happened.

139
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,749
- That's easy. I had dinner in
a different block that night.

140
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,781
- Why did you do that?
- 'Cause they told me to.

141
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,645
- Who told you to?
- The guards.

142
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,638
Look, they would post it
on the wall whenever

143
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,601
they felt like it to keep us
from getting too comfortable.

144
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,966
- Which means
you don't know the guard

145
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,821
who decided to move you,
and you don't know the name

146
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,624
of the guy
you got in a fight with.

147
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,587
- I'm telling you guys, man,
I'm not lying.

148
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:12,979
- I don't think you are.

149
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,969
I think they set it up that way.

.

160
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,215
- Louis.
- Hold on, man.

161
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,650
- What are you doing?

162
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,945
- Playing desktop cornhole.

163
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,809
It's supposed to calm my nerves.

164
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,799
- Okay, I hate to interrupt,
but I need to ask a favor.

165
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,659
- Anything.
What do you need?

166
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,851
- You know I was seeing
a psychiatrist last year, right?

167
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,745
- Harvey, if this has
to do with your well-being,

168
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,778
I'm all ears, but as you know,

169
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm not a licensed practitioner
of mental health services...

170
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,462
- Louis, that's not it.

171
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,694
Look, my psychiatrist
is being sued.

172
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:17,757
She has her own attorney,
but I don't trust him,

173
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,711
and I want you to handle it.
- I don't understand.

174
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:21,714
If you don't trust him,
why aren't you taking it?

175
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,438
- I told you,
she's my therapist.

176
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,432
- Yeah, was.

177
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:26,796
That doesn't stop you from
helping her with a legal issue.

178
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,132
- All right, you want the truth?

179
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,787
I'm seeing her.

180
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,450
- You're dating your therapist?

181
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,343
- Look, I don't need
a lecture from you, Louis.

182
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,368
- This isn't a lecture, Harvey.
If you're dating your therapist

183
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,370
and someone finds out about it,
she could lose her license.

184
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,324
- No, she can't.

185
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,658
We didn't start dating until

186
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,652
after the official
waiting period was over.

187
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,714
- I want your word on that,
because if someone ever asks...

188
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,644
- You have my word.
I wouldn't lie about that.

189
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:53,734
- Okay, I'll go talk to her.

190
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,896
But wait a second, Harvey,

191
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:59,056
does Donna have any idea
about the two of you?

192
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,750
- No, she doesn't,

193
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:04,508
and for right now I'd like
to keep it that way.

194
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,756
- Six years for stealing
a few TVs, that's not right.

195
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:13,257
- No, it's not.
- What's our next move?

196
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,582
- We gotta figure out
who decided

197
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,346
a guy two months from parole

198
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,439
should eat
in a different cellblock.

199
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,004
- How the hell
are we gonna do that?

200
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,330
- I don't know, Oliver,
but right now you're gonna

201
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,994
have to work on that yourself.

202
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,459
- What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

203
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,283
- If I don't show
my face at work,

204
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,216
Harvey is gonna get suspicious.

205
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:32,441
- Mike, are you sure what
we're doing is worth it?

206
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:33,707
- Oliver, you're the one
that pushed me

207
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,562
to stick with this
in the first place.

208
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,624
You heard that guy,
they doubled his sentence.

209
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,384
Chris Reyes is dead.

210
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,617
Yeah, it's worth it.

211
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,466
- You must be Harvey Specter.

212
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,300
- Thanks for meeting me, Rick.

213
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:52,653
I know dominating the energy
sector is a full-time job.

214
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,655
- Get to the point,
Mr. Specter.

215
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,147
I didn't interrupt my day
just so you could kiss my ass.

216
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,573
- Then let me tell you
why you did.

217
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,203
Lockwood Energy is about
to release a solar panel

218
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,330
that looks a hell of a lot
like the one

219
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,535
you've been developing
for years.

220
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:05,129
- How did you know that?

221
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,455
- Because I didn't
spend all morning

222
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,349
brushing up
on my ass-kissing techniques.

223
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,714
- Then you also know that
Lockwood's green division

224
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,608
has only existed
for three months.

225
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,441
They stole that technology.

226
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,707
- Which is why
you should sign with me

227
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,570
so I can go get it back.

228
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:18,325
- I already have a law firm.

229
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,188
Why shouldn't
I let them handle this?

230
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:22,320
- Because you don't want
the guy who's gonna sue Lockwood

231
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,184
after they've stolen
your girlfriend.

232
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,410
You want the guy who's gonna
put them in the ground

233
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,074
before they get the chance.

234
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,137
- You're pretty
sure of yourself.

235
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,062
- You want someone
handling this who isn't?

236
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:34,160
Look, why don't you take
the week to think it over.

237
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,153
Of course,
while you're doing that,

238
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,415
Lockwood's gonna be rushing
your product to market,

239
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,137
and when they do, your
board's gonna be wondering

240
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:44,465
why you didn't hire me
when you had the chance.

241
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,454
- All right, Mr. Specter,
you win.

242
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:49,418
You've got three days.

243
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,452
Let's see if you're as good
as you think you are.

244
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,054
- You must be Paula Agard.

245
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:03,490
- I'm sorry,
but do we know each other?

246
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:06,042
- Not yet, but it is
a pleasure to meet you.

247
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:08,173
I'm Louis Litt, and I understand

248
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,569
you are looking for a lawyer.

249
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,061
- I have a lawyer,
and his name's Peter Shumpert.

250
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:14,063
- Ah, Peter will not
be joining you today.

251
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:15,420
- Excuse me?
- I mean, I'm sure

252
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,183
he's a nice guy,
but he's not a litigator.

253
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:18,717
- Well, I don't see what that
has to do with this.

254
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,242
- When an attorney
lets a client meet

255
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:21,707
with another attorney, trust me,

256
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,272
you need better representation.

257
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,036
- I already know what
an excellent attorney

258
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,999
you are, Mr. Litt.

259
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,256
Harvey said as much when
he offered your services.

260
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,254
- And why'd you turn him down?
- Because...

261
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,248
there are things
about this situation

262
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:34,942
that I'd rather
not share with Harvey.

263
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,506
- I can understand that
completely,

264
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,297
and whatever they are,
if I were your attorney,

265
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,291
there is no way in hell that
he would hear them from me.

266
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:45,945
That I can assure you.

267
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:48,176
- Okay.
Okay, Louis.

268
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,110
You can represent me.

269
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,329
- Good. So let's start by
you giving me the history.

270
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,093
- Well, that's just it.

271
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,956
We weren't solely
business partners.

272
00:09:56,957 --> 00:10:00,913
We were living together,
we had a practice together.

273
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,109
- What happened?

274
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,002
- He broke it off,
and he broke my heart.

275
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,932
I gave him everything in
the partnership that he wanted

276
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,826
just to be rid of it and of him.

277
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,590
- And then?

278
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,583
- Some of our group patients
didn't respond well

279
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:14,278
to his treatment,
so they started

280
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,041
coming to see me privately.

281
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,905
- Privately or secretly?

282
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,798
- If what you're asking
is if I knew it was a violation

283
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,164
of our agreement,
then yes, I did.

284
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,097
But these people were hurting.

285
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,549
- And you couldn't in good
conscience turn them away.

286
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,013
- No, I couldn't.

287
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:29,076
- Paula, you have my word,

288
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:33,003
this stays between you and me.

289
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:34,798
- Thank you.

290

[phone buzzes]

291
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:42,242
- Oliver, tell me
you found something.

292
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,175
- Nothing.
They've got a system

293
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,168
that randomly assigns changes
from time to time.

294
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,932
<i>- Well, what are you
calling me for?</i>

295
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,825
- Because there
might not be a link

296
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,122
<i>between our cases
and the guards,</i>

297
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:53,054
<i>but I did find one
between the fights.</i>

298
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,047
- I'm listening.
- <i>Out of the 20 cases</i>

301
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:00,768
and I got the perfect one,
JaMarcus Collins.

302
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:01,995
He's in the middle of
a ten-year sentence

303
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,997
on cellblock C,
one over from Chris Reyes

304
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,791
<i>and Marc Stevens.</i>

305
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,784
- Well, then we gotta pay
Mr. Collins a visit.

306
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:09,777
- I've already set it up.
I'll pick you up in an hour.

307
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:11,672
- Great.

308
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,670
I will see you at the Brooklyn
Housing Authority then. Okay.

309
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,793
- Whatever you're doing,
put it on hold.

00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,956
I've got a good cop/bad cop
situation and I need you.

311
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,251
- Wait, right now?

312
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,946
- No, three months
from Thursday.

313
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,650
Come on, let's go.
- Harvey, I can't.

314
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:24,676
- What do you mean you can't?

315
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,141
- I ha... I have a meeting

316
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,702
with Oliver at
the Brooklyn Housing Authority.

317
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,127
I can't leave him hanging.
- Oliver?

318
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,728
You just did a pro bono.
That's not our deal.

319
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,851
- I know that, Harvey, but I
put this in motion weeks ago.

320
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:36,844
I didn't know you were gonna
give me another pro bono.

321
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,379
- Fine, I'll handle it myself.

322
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,804
Look, whatever you're
doing with Oliver,

323
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,699
wrap it the hell up.

324
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,629
I didn't bring you back to not
be here when I need you.

325
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,625
.

326
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,009
- Dr. Lipschitz, it's Louis.

327
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,896
Um, look, there's
no two ways to say this.

328
00:11:56,897 --> 00:12:00,194
I was way out of line
the other night,

329
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,955
and I know you care about me,

330
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,871
and not just because
you have an obligation to.

331
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,567
So if it's not too much trouble,

332
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,925
I would like to resume
our sessions, please.

333
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:14,028
Please call me back.
Thanks.

334
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,910
- Louis, I need to talk
to you about Harvey.

335
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,076
- What about him?

336
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,272
- I just want to make sure
that you and he

337
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,936
are on good terms.

338
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:25,160
- Yeah, Donna,
we're on good terms.

339
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,192
- Are you sure?
'Cause we all pulled together

340
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,185
to get back on solid footing,
and I saw the two of you

341
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:31,118
huddled up in here earlier,
and I'd hate to think

342
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,942
that things are going
in the wrong direction.

343
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:34,876
- No, not going in
the wrong direction, Donna.

344
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:36,101
There is no need to worry.

345
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,494
- Well, I do worry, Louis.

346
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,856
Because I know what kind of
mental state you're still in,

347
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,759
and I know that the slightest
thing can touch you off,

348
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,483
and I know that...
- Look, Donna,

349
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,775
for your information,
we are on such good terms

350
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,177
that Harvey...

351
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,871
- That Harvey what?

352
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,764
- Nothing.

353
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,190
- Louis, what's going on?

354
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,854
- Okay, look, Donna,

355
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,848
I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

356
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,810
Harvey asked me to handle
a matter for him.

357
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:01,804
It's personal.
He trusts me with it.

358
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,067
Now, if you trust me at all,
you'll take my word for the fact

359
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:07,863
that Harvey and I
are on good terms.

360
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,786
- Okay.

361
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,880
I trust you.

362
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,795
- Harvey Specter.
We didn't have

363
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,758
a proper introduction
the last time we met.

364
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,915
Holly Cromwell.

365
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,379
- What do you want,
Ms. Cromwell?

366
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,676
- So much for formalities.

367
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,110
- I got a lot on my plate.

368
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,003
I don't have time
for formalities.

369
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,767
- If you brought me on,
maybe you would.

370
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,094
- Excuse me?

371
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,897
- Headhunting isn't cutting it
for me, Mr. Specter.

372
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,720
I want back in the game,

373
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:39,853
and since you're the reason
I'm out of the game,

374
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:42,743
you should hire me as
a full-time in-house consultant.

375
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,706
- So you want me to give you
a handout out of guilt?

376
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,331
- I don't want a handout.

377
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,724
But you made me a promise you
wouldn't ruin my reputation.

378
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:50,687
- What do you want me to say?

379
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,689
What you do is dangerous.

380
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,613
- I want you to say you make
promises you can't keep.

381
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,048
And by the way,
you wouldn't have sent

382
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,902
that Rachel woman back to me
if you didn't know

383
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:59,835
what I do is worth it.
- Okay, first of all,

384
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:01,698
I never sent anyone back to you.

385
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,722
And second, whatever job
you think you're suited for

386
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:05,286
doesn't exist in my firm.

387
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,280
- It does at Baker Simms
and Walker Stein.

388
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,282
- Yeah, well, I'm not looking
to make a spot on the payroll

389
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,674
for someone whose only
skill set is crossing lines.

390
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,634
- You mean when you cross them
so well yourself.

391
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,595
- Like I said, Ms. Cromwell,
I got a lot on my plate.

392
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,909
- Give me a Macallan, neat.

393
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,872
- The way Lockwood
stock shot up,

394
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,234
why not make it a double?

395
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,858
- I'm sorry,
I don't recognize you.

396
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:32,652
Do you work in Business Affairs?

397
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,512
- No, I work in suing your ass
for trying to pass off

398
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:37,606
Galvadyne's solar panels
as your own.

399
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,841
- I don't know who you are,

400
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,834
and I don't know
what you're talking about.

401
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,728
We developed
that technology in-house.

402
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,561
- Oh, bullshit.

403
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,485
That technology
takes years to develop,

404
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,747
and your entire division's
only been in existence

405
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,841
since last Tuesday.
- What can I say?

406
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:52,704
When you invest
in the right talent,

407
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,534
you can move mountains,
and last I checked,

408
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,757
being smarter than your
competition wasn't illegal.

409
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,889
- Well, if you're half as smart
as you say you are,

410
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,882
you'd give us
our product back now,

411
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:04,712
or we'll take your company
from you later.

412
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:07,135
- If you're here
without the FBI,

413
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,838
it means you're just
a shakedown artist

414
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,490
without a shred of evidence
to back up your claims.

415
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,416
- No, it means I'm giving you
the chance to make it right.

416
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:18,506
Because once I prove
you stole our technology,

417
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:19,741
the only thing
you'll be celebrating

418
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,835
is a felony fraud conviction.

419
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,488
- Thanks for meeting us,
Mr. Collins.

420
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,386
I'm Oliver Grady,
and this is my associate.

421
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,049
- Your associate got a name?

422
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,471
- My name's not as important
as the questions I have.

423
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,464
Like why did you incite
a brawl in the cafeteria

424
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:39,065
during lunch on November 4th
of last year?

425
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,689
- What is this?
I thought you were here

426
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,423
to talk about reviving
my shot at parole.

427
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:44,347
- We can absolutely
talk about that,

428
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,609
after you tell us why
you conspired with this prison

429
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,300
to get your fellow inmates'
sentences extended.

430
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,432
- This is bullshit.
Guard!

431
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,556
- Listen, you don't have
to talk to us.

432
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,319
But this thing comes out,

433
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,382
instead of getting out
in five years,

434
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,747
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in here.

435
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,668
- All right,
what do you wanna know?

436
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,401
- Let's start with who's
telling you to pick fights

437
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,365
with guys who are
about to get out.

438
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,389
- Nobody ever told me
to pick a fight with anybody.

439
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,620
All I know is new guy
comes into the block,

440
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,545
I'm supposed to teach him
a lesson.

441
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,377
- Well, how do you know that
if nobody ever told you?

442
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,673
- It happened, like,
two years go.

443
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,265
I got in a fight with a guy,
they dragged me away.

444
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,367
Thought they were gonna
throw me in Solitary.

445
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,589
Instead, they threw him
in Solitary.

446
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,217
I get back to my cell,
brand-new PlayStation in there.

447
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,678
- And let me guess,
you never thought to ask why.

448
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,668
- I knew why, and I'm not giving
up my goddamn PlayStation.

449
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,930
- You willing to testify
to that in court?

450
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,658
- You really gonna
get me out of here early?

451
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,448
Yeah, I didn't think so.

452
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,343
Guard!

453
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,432
- Hey, how'd it go?

454
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,534
- Well, if you're wondering
if I convinced Paula

455
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:48,527
to take me on,
the answer is yes.

456
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,252
I am her lawyer now.

457
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,985
We have a settlement
meeting tomorrow,

458
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,178
and this is the last we will
speak about it ever again.

459
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,240
- Louis...
- No, Harvey.

460
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,165
Paula is my client now,
and I don't wanna have to worry

461
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,829
about you sticking
your nose in a case

462
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,324
that you think you can
handle better than me.

463
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,256
- I don't think...
- Because if you could

464
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,583
handle it better than me,
you would, but you can't,

465
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:06,286
because you're too involved,
and you know it.

466
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,240
- You're right.
She's in good hands.

467
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,143
I'll stay out of your way.
- Ah, no. Not good enough.

468
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,834
I want your word, because
I will drop it right now.

469
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:16,462
- Okay, Louis, you have my word.

470
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,168
- Harvey. Everything okay
with you and Louis?

471
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,533
- Yeah. Why?

472
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:30,194
- 'Cause he said he was
handling a matter for you,

473
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,320
but he wouldn't tell me
what it was,

474
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,315
and five minutes ago
I saw the two of you

475
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,077
having an intense discussion.

476
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,413
- Everything's okay,

477
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,406
and it wasn't
an intense discussion.

478
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,070
It was a strategic meeting,

479
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,327
so you don't need
to get involved.

480
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,160
- I wasn't trying
to get involved.

481
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,425
I was coming to tell you
that Rick Dunn's

482
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,289
been waiting in your office
for 15 minutes.

483
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,213
- 15 minutes? Why didn't
you come and get me right away?

484
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,306
- Because I only just noticed
him when I walked by,

485
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,139
and I'm not your
secretary anymore.

486
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,332
I'm COO of this firm,
so instead of criticizing me

487
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,362
for working late, why don't
you go see what he wants?

488
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,115
- Rick, I could have
come to your office

489
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:04,108
if I'd known
you wanted to see me.

490
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,443
- Well, when someone's
avoiding me, I come to them.

491
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,099
- No one's avoiding anyone.

492
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:08,802
I was gonna give you
a call later.

493
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,696
- And if you had good news,
you'd have done it already.

494
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:12,420
So what the hell happened?

495
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,353
- What do you think happened?
They denied everything

496
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,316
and said they developed
that technology on their own.

497
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:17,972
- Well, I don't give a shit
what they said.

498
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:20,035
You said you could
get me results.

499
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:22,336
- And I will, but I didn't say
it would take just one meeting.

500
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:24,957
- Well, let me tell you what
happened after that one meeting.

501
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,050
They just announced
they're moving up their launch

502
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,252
by a month.
- Rick, listen to me.

503
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,946
They're not moving anything up.

504
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:33,170
It's a bluff,
and I give you my word,

505
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,371
they'll never go to market
with your product.

506
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,325
- Now you listen to me.

507
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:40,155
You said you wouldn't have
anything after one meeting.

508
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:42,317
Well, you sure as hell
better have it after two.

509
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:44,908
Because if you don't, I'm gonna
tell everyone in the city

510
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,903
that the only thing
Harvey Specter is good at

511
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:50,001
is making promises
he can't keep.

512
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:52,922
<i>[tense music]</i>

513
00:18:58,612 --> 00:18:59,937
.

514
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,272
- Shit.
There's no paper trail

515
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,692
proving any inmates were
rewarded for picking fights.

516
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,555
- Okay. Just because
Collins didn't talk

517
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:07,591
doesn't mean
the other three won't.

518
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:08,856
- Yes, it does, and you know it.

519
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,580
And none of them
are close to parole,

520
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,544
which means we don't even
have that to offer.

521
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:13,809
- Okay, then let's go back
through the guards again.

522
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,673
- I told you, that's a dead end.

523
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:18,564
Brunswick has a system
of randomly assigning changes.

524
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,951
- Then let's start looking
outside of Brunswick.

525
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:27,542
- Holy shit.

526
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,510
You're right.

527
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:29,735
They own eight other prisons,

528
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,529
and if they're
doing this in one...

529
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,825
- Then they're doing it
at the other seven.

530
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,190
- And maybe one of them
isn't as good

531
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:35,485
at covering their tracks.
- Bingo.

532
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:37,219
All right, let's do it.

533
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,814
'Cause I'm supposed to be
at dinner right now with Rachel,

534
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:40,539
not going through files
with you.

535
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,471
- Take your pick.

536
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,733
Wabash, Dalton,

537
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:46,896
Lambert and Blackwell...

538
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,518
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Lambert?

539
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,616
Lambert Correctional Institute
is owned by Reform Corp?

540
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:54,709
- Yeah, why?
You know someone there?

541
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,132
- No.

542
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,463
No, I know somebody
who used to be there.

543
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,456
- He the kinda guy
who'd know something?

544
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:04,686
- He's the kinda guy
that would know everything.

545
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,566
- Rachel, have you seen Mike?
He's not in his office.

546
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,429
- Uh, he left earlier
this morning for the clinic,

547
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,825
so he must still be there.

548
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,386
- Again? I told him
to wrap that case up.

549
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:19,385
- Harvey, he's working hard
to live up to your deal

550
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,641
and still come through
for his other clients.

551
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,604
- Well, right now I need him,

552
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,537
and I'm getting a little tired
of looking into his office

553
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,063
and finding it empty.

554
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,095
- Maybe there's something
I can do to help you.

555
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,357
- No, it's fine.

556
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,480
Just let him know
I'm looking for him.

557
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,340
Actually, now that you mention
it, there is one thing.

558
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,074
I heard you went back
to Holly Cromwell.

559
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,336
- Yes, Mike and I did.
Is there a problem?

560
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,532
- No, there's no problem.

561
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,057
I just want to know
if she came through.

562
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,622
- Well, she stuck it to us
on the fee a little,

563
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,356
but other than that,
yeah, she came through.

564
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,279
- Was it worth it?

565
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,043
- Let me put it this way, the
article they wrote about Mike,

566
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:51,277
it never would have
existed without her.

567
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,606
- Wow.
If it isn't Mike Ross.

568
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,297
I take it you're not here
selling Girl Scout cookies,

569
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:10,290
but if you are,
I'll take two boxes

570
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,387
of go fu... yourself.

571
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,220
- Just sit down, Gallo.

572
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:14,546
I don't want to be here
any more than you do,

573
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:16,440
but I need your help.

574
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,602
- Last time I helped you,
I got five years for my trouble.

575
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:20,466
- Well, maybe we can
do something about that.

576
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,329
- What the hell is this?

577
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,957
- That is a lawsuit
against your former prison,

578
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,581
for starting fights with inmates

579
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,376
so that they could
extend their sentences,

580
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,936
and I want you
to be an expert witness.

581
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,371
- You gotta be shitting me.

582
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,235
- Frank...
- Save your breath.

583
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:36,630
There's not a chance
in hell I'm doing this.

584
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,394
- What if I told you I could
make it worth your while?

585
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,889
- It doesn't matter
because I don't know

586
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,414
what the hell
you're talking about anyway.

587
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:43,209
- Bullshit.
You expect me to believe

588
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,370
that you own
all the guards in here,

589
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,165
but you didn't know
about a conspiracy

590
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,500
at your last prison?

591
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:50,463
- Sounds like you know
a whole hell of a lot.

592
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,426
What do you need me for?
- I need somebody

593
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,589
to tell me everything, and
in exchange I am willing to...

594
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,512
- I'll tell you
what you're willing to do.

595
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,406
What you promised to do
in the first place.

596
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,841
You're gonna get me out of here.

597
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,505
- You know I can't do that.

598
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,399
- Bullshit. That Cahill guy
owes you big time.

599
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,163
March those pretty
little feet in there

600
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,488
and say what has to be said,

601
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,282
or you won't know
anything about anything.

602
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,276
While you're at it,
next time you're here

603
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,578
bring me a goddamn cookie.

604
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:21,417
- Hope you had time to look over
the settlement offer I sent.

605
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:23,212
- To be Frank, Mr. Litt,
this number's so low,

606
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,516
we won't even be countering.

607
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,371
We're not negotiating
against ourselves.

608
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,303
- Oh, no, you want me
to negotiate against myself.

609
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:30,197
Let me tell you something,
that number should be zero.

610
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:32,758
But Dr. Agard
is willing to pay something

611
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,090
in order to put
this matter behind her.

612
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:37,482
- But she's not willing to face
me and own up to what she did.

613
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:40,043
- All she did, Dr. Manning,
was care for your patients.

614
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,369
- Which means she violated
their partnership agreement.

615
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,163
- And according
to the Hippocratic Oath,

616
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:45,295
patient care supersedes
any legal agreement.

617
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,721
- She didn't care
about those patients.

618
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,325
She just wanted
to steal my business.

619
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,080
- Really? Then why
did they contact her?

620
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,384
- You have no proof of that.

621
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:53,377
- Yes, I do.
I have phone records.

622
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,371
My client had
an ethical obligation

623
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,035
to care for those patients.

624
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,699
- And what about
her ethical obligation

625
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,061
not to sleep with a patient?
- What'd you just say?

626
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:03,414
- I know that she's been running
around with Harvey Specter,

627
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,715
and it's no surprise that it's
his partner defending her.

628
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,037
- Dr. Agard's personal life
has no bearing on this case.

629
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,702
- Oh, it'll have
plenty of bearing

630
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,396
when the ethics board learn
that she started dating

631
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,091
one of her patients

632
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,053
before the mandatory
waiting period elapsed.

633
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:17,385
- That's a bald-faced lie,
and now you're twisting facts

634
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,210
in order to blackmail my client.

635
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,644
- Blackmail is
a serious accusation.

636
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,069
My client never asked
for anything

637
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,933
in exchange for his silence.

638
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:24,969
- Well, he sure as shit
implied it.

639
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,326
- This meeting's over,
Mr. Litt.

640
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:27,660
Why don't you take
the evening to cool down?

641
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:30,252
Think of a real number.

642
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,271
- The great Harvey Specter

643
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:38,962
came all the way
below 14th Street to see me.

644
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:40,964
I'm honored.
- What can I say?

645
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,919
When I have good news, I like
to deliver it face-to-face.

646
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,881
- Does that mean
you're ready to hire me?

647
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,044
- Not yet, but if you
take care of something for me,

648
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:49,904
I just might be.

649
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,933
- Lockwood's launching
a solar panel?

650
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:55,096
Since when are they in
the renewable energy business?

651
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,588
- Since they stole
the technology from Galvadyne.

652
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,850
- No way.
They didn't steal it.

653
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:00,976
- How can you know that?

654
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:02,870
- Because there's only
six people capable

655
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,574
of that kind of work, and if
one of them did it, I'd know.

656
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,068
- Well, they got it somehow,

657
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,862
and I need to know
how they did it.

658
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,128
- That's not a hell of
a lot to go on.

659
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:11,251
- If I had more to go on,
I wouldn't need you.

660
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:14,081
- In other words, you want me
to do the impossible to audition

661
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:16,972
for a job you told me
yesterday didn't even exist?

662
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,868
- Then consider it
a magic trick.

663
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,791
You make this
information appear,

664
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,157
all of a sudden,
so does that job.

665
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,821
- Then start picking out
an office,

666
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:26,978
because the next time
you hear from me,

667
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:29,738
I'm moving in.

668
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,783
- Where the hell have
you been all morning?

669
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,118
[door shuts]

670
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,739
- I went to see Sean Cahill
at the S.E.C.

671
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,175
- I hate to break it to you,
Mike, but the S.E.C.

672
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:46,998
doesn't have jurisdiction
over private prisons.

673
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,992
- I know that. I was trying
to cut Frank Gallo a deal.

674
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,453
- Whoa.
He said he'll testify?

675
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:53,785
- Not unless he gets parole,
and Cahill said no.

676
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,706
Which means we need to go
through Gallo's files,

677
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:59,735
see if we can find another way
to get him released.

678
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:01,698
- Mike, Mike, hold up a second.

679
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,822
Gallo's files said
he got an extra five years

680
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,682
for assault with a deadly weapon
while he was at Danbury.

681
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,116
- So?

682
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,677
- So that's pretty damn close
to when you got outta there.

683
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,901
Mike.

684
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,934
Is this the guy
who tried to kill you?

685
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,690
- Oliver...
- Jesus, Mike!

686
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,384
We can't put a guy like that
out on the street.

687
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,777
- I'm not trying
to get him out now.

688
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,639
All right, I'm gonna
get him out two years early,

689
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,634
which is still
five years from now.

690
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,068
And in the meantime
if I don't do that,

691
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,659
how many guys are gonna end up
just like Chris Reyes?

692
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,753
- Right now I'm worried about
you ending up like Chris Reyes.

693
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,316
- If Gallo is gonna
come after me,

694
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:36,648
it doesn't matter if it's
in five years or seven.

695
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,641
We only have so long
before me working on this

696
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:41,632
becomes too risky, which
means this is the only way.

697
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:47,591
- Okay.

698
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:50,311
But I've seen you do things
no other lawyer could.

699
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:52,306
You're sure as shit
smart enough to convince

700
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:53,939
this guy to take
something besides parole.

701
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,633
- You don't know Frank Gallo.

702
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:56,899
- What I know
is what you taught me.

703
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,624
Everybody has
something they want.

704
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,257
Which means all you have
to do is find out

705
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,620
whatever else Gallo wants
and give it to him.

706
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:08,240
- Louis, hello.
How did it go?

707
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,835
- Listen to me,
if I'm gonna be your attorney,

708
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,698
I need you to tell me
the goddamn truth.

709
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,691
- I'm not sure I like your tone.
I told you the truth.

710
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:15,585
- Did you?
Because I need to know

711
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,548
if you started seeing Harvey
while he was still your patient.

712
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,572
- What? No.
Who told you that?

713
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,734
- Your ex, and he's threatening
to go to the board with it.

714
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:23,529
If there is
one shred of proof...

715
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,631
- There isn't any proof,
because it didn't happen.

716
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:27,524
And if you don't care
to believe that,

717
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,517
then you can turn around
and walk right out.

718
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,853
Because I don't care to be
represented by a man

719
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,776
who questions my integrity.

720
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:34,670
- Okay, I am sorry.

721
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:36,633
I just don't like
being blindsided.

722
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:37,899
- Well, I'm glad
your shock is behind you,

723
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,762
but mine isn't.

724
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,626
What do you mean
he's going to the board?

725
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:43,619
- I mean he is blackmailing you

726
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,582
with the threat
of going to the board.

727
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,442
- What?

728
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:49,699
That would ruin my career.

729
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,559
- I know, which is why
you need to tell me

730
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,792
what really happened
between you and Jacob now.

731
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,717
- Louis, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

732
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,680
- I'm sorry, Paula,
but you're gonna have to,

733
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:03,401
because the only defense
against what he is trying to do

734
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:06,392
is the truth.

735
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:07,557
- When I told you
he broke my heart,

736
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,414
I was telling the truth.

737
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,109
But what I didn't tell you
was that after that

738
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,541
he changed his mind.

739
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,190
.

740
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:25,546
- Donna, I need you
to draw up some paperwork

741
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,911
for a new employee.

742
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,771
- I'll get to it
first thing in the morning.

743
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:31,634
Wait a second,
why are we bringing on

744
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:33,498
Holly Cromwell as a consultant?

745
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:35,323
- Because she kicks ass,
and I don't want to have

746
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,956
to track her down every time
I need her help with something.

747
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,949
- Harvey, I think this
is a mistake.

748
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,614
- Well, it's my call.

749
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:42,577
- No, actually it isn't.

750
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,873
- Excuse me?

751
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,598
- I told you, I'm not
your secretary anymore.

752
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:47,500
I'm COO, and you
made me that for a reason.

753
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,560
I know people, and I'm
telling you it's reckless

754
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:52,553
to hire someone
who betrayed her employer

755
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:53,819
the first chance she got.

756
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,573
- Donna, I gave her
my word I'd do this

757
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:56,978
if she came through,
she's gonna come through,

758
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,733
and I already broke
my word to her once.

759
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,436
- Well, then maybe you
shouldn't promise a job

760
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:01,662
at a law firm to someone
who isn't a lawyer.

761
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,426
- Are you kidding me?

762
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,920
You're not a lawyer,
I just promoted you,

763
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,884
and that worked out pretty
damn well if you ask me.

764
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,770
- And you only did that after I
proved my loyalty to this firm.

765
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,534
- And she's gonna start
proving her loyalty now.

766
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,870
Need I remind you that...

767
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,391
- That you're in charge?
No, you don't.

768
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:17,856
And if you try to give me your,

769
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:19,781
"This isn't something
we vote on" bullshit,

770
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,680
I will find out where Louis is,
and I will bring him

771
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,543
down here right now
with a copy of the bylaws,

772
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:28,760
because I am betting it is
something we vote on.

773
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,493
- Okay, Donna, you win.

774
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:31,888
You don't wanna hire her,
we won't.

775
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,519
But you wanna be the one
to make that call,

776
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,812
you're gonna be the one
to tell her to her face.

777
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

778
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,549
You hungry? There's some
leftover Thai in the kitchen.

779
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,445
- Great, I'm starving.
Haven't eaten all day.

780
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:52,668
- Mike, about that,
I know I said that maybe

781
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:54,431
you should ask Harvey
for a little time off

782
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,628
to help with the clinic,

783
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:57,829
but I'm wondering if maybe

784
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,454
you should take
a little time off

785
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,417
from the clinic to help Harvey.

786
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:02,812
- Rachel...
- He was looking for you today,

787
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,305
and it was clear
it wasn't the first time.

788
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,406
And you said yourself,
he was nice enough

789
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,632
to make this deal
in the first place,

790
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:11,263
so maybe it's time
to remember that.

791
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,585
- I do remember that.

792
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,779
It's not like we work
on every case together.

793
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,283
He knows that.

794
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,636
- And I know that, too.

795
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:22,335
But he brought you back
for a reason,

796
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:24,358
and that's so that
when he does need you,

797
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,755
you'll be there.

798
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:29,381
- You're right.

799
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:33,477
I'm just... I'm working
on this Brooklyn Housing thing,

800
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:36,467
and there's a deadline.

801
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,460
But as soon as it is over,

802
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:40,623
I will take a break
from the clinic.

803
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:42,417
Promise.

804
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:44,280
- Okay.

805
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,603
- Now, did you get
the spring rolls that I like?

806
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,436
- Yes.

807
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,698
No.
Maybe?

808
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:52,293
- You ate them all, didn't you?

809
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,529
- Well, they were calling
out my name.

810
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,284
- Every time!
- You know that.

811
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,519
It's the sauce!

812
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:02,499
- Louis, we've never discussed
the specifics of a case before.

813
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,398
Why do you think this one is
so important all of a sudden?

814
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,262
- I don't know.

815
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,557
She kept telling me
all these horrible things

816
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,251
about this guy, but...

817
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,444
- But what, Louis?

818
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:16,201
- She also told me that all he
wanted to do was get her back.

819
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:18,134
She felt sorry for him.

820
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,454
I guess I felt sorry
for him, too.

821
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:24,114
- Sorry for him or for yourself?

822
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,108
- What are you talking about?

823
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:29,068
- Louis, I hate to draw
comparisons for you,

824
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,529
but is there a chance
you're putting yourself

825
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,329
in this man's shoes
because it's so similar

826
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,084
to what happened
between you and Tara?

827
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:38,514
- I didn't cheat on her.
- But you behaved poorly.

828
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:42,042
It ended the relationship,
and you wanted her back.

829
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:44,165
- And I told you
that I do not want

830
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,497
to talk about getting closure
with Tara anymore.

831
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:51,121
- I know that, Louis,
but it is my duty

832
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:52,546
to keep bringing it up to you.

833
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:57,041
Otherwise, why are we
seeing each other?

834
00:30:57,042 --> 00:31:00,330
- Okay, then, Doc,

835
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:03,359
honestly,
I don't think that's it.

836
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,382
- Then you shouldn't
have any trouble

837
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:08,244
doing what you know
you have to do.

838
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:15,389
- Holly, right?
- Yes.

839
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,989
- I'm Donna Paulsen.
Thanks for meeting me so early.

840
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,182
- No problem. We can go over
the deal points informally,

841
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,106
but I will need my lawyer
to take a look at the contract

842
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,039
before I sign.

843
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,304
- Actually, I have a few
questions for you first.

844
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:27,068
- What kind of questions?

845
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:28,194
- The kind that determine

846
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:30,487
if you're
Pearson Specter Litt material.

847
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,042
- I'm not here
for my contract, am I?

848
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:36,177
I'm here because you have
a problem with me.

849
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:37,902
- I do have a problem with you.

850
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:39,436
- I see what this is.
I should have known.

851
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:41,897
I have an MBA from Wharton,
I graduated with honors,

852
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:43,422
and you think
all I am is a high-priced...

853
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:46,352
- No, I don't give a shit what
you think about sex and men.

854
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:48,974
My problem is that you're
in the betrayal business.

855
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:51,006
You betray the men
that you prey on,

856
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:52,333
and then the only time
we had an interaction with you,

857
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,335
you turned on your employer.

858
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,996
- Well, why don't you bring
that up with your employer?

859
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:58,850
Because he's the one
who got me in that position.

860
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,982
It was the first and last time
I ever did anything like that,

861
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:02,876
and I lost my livelihood
because of it.

862
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,969
- I didn't know that.

863
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,201
- Discretion and integrity were
the foundations of my business.

864
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:09,991
Your boss knocked them down,
and I don't appreciate you

865
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:13,150
questioning whether or not they
were there in the first place.

866
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,244
- What's this?

867
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:18,941
- That is what I thought I'd be
delivering to my new employer.

868
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:20,834
- This is exactly
what Harvey needed.

869
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,199
How the hell did you get this?

870
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,063
- What I do is an art.

871
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,824
I find out what people want,
what they're afraid of,

872
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,916
what makes them tick,
and I use it.

873
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,910
And they never know
the big picture,

874
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,002
so when they give me what I
need, they think it's nothing.

875
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:34,866
- And then when you put
all the pieces together,

876
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:37,926
it adds up to exactly what
your clients are looking for.

877
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,118
- That's everything
I promised I'd get Harvey,

878
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,875
and it took me less than a day.

879
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:46,009
I kept my word.

880
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:56,851
- Where's my cookie?

881
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,744
- Brought you something
better than a cookie.

882
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,937
You were a prisoner
under Reform Corp, too,

883
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:05,162
which means you are now
a member of the class.

884
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:08,222
We win this, you're not
Brooks Hatlen bagging groceries

885
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:10,085
at the Food-Way
when you get out.

886
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:12,806
You're gonna be Andy Dufresne
sitting on a beach in Mexico

887
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,939
with a bank account
full of cash.

888
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,802
- I already make
a nice living in here.

889
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,956
- You do, but I was thinking
maybe some of that money

890
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,058
might go to your daughter.
- What'd you just say to me?

891
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,676
- I did some digging, Frank.
I know you don't talk to her.

892
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,778
And she is not doing great,
and this much money

893
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,101
could really change her life.

894
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:35,718
- If you're playing
with me on this thing...

895
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,083
- I'm not playing you, Frank.

896
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,644
And I'm not trying
to bully you with this.

897
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,768
I'm trying to help you.

898
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:51,713
- We had an arrangement.

899
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:52,949
- Brokered directly
by the prison?

900
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,669
- Not at first,
but I saw the pattern.

901
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,031
Break some skulls, get a reward.

902
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,692
So I went to the source
to get things codified.

903
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,019
- And did you?
- Yeah.

904
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,951
Found out what was what.

905
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:06,014
It was good at first,
then I realized

906
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:07,938
it was like working for the mob.

907
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:10,668
Great work while you can get it,
but you can never quit.

908
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,927
So I tried to put an end
to the whole thing.

909
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,618
That night the guards
killed the cameras,

910
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,780
and five of my so-called
friends did a number on me.

911
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:20,046
- Wait a second.
Are you saying this the deal

912
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,610
that got you to Danbury?

913
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:22,776
You already informed on
this guy?

914
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,600
- No, what are you, nuts?

915
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:27,591
No one cares how prisoners
are treated.

916
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:29,623
I informed on real guys
about real crimes.

917
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:31,018
That's how I got out.

918
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,480
- Are you willing to go on
the record with this?

919
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,875
Tell me your source?

920
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:37,766
- It's not gonna be
that easy, Mikey.

921
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,766
I'm gonna need an advance
on that settlement.

922
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:47,941
.

923
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,472
- Please, sit down.

924
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,903
- Glad to see you've come back
with a real number, Mr. Litt.

925
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:54,498
- The only number I'm back with

926
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,391
is the one that
I'm gonna do on your client.

927
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:58,285
- What the hell? You said
he was ready to cut a check.

928
00:34:58,286 --> 00:34:59,849
- Oh, well, what she should
have told you, Jacob,

929
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,874
is when you threaten
someone with blackmail,

930
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,308
you better goddamn be ready
to defend yourself.

931
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,902
- And you better watch how
you talk to my client.

932
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,865
- You client is a lying,
cheating piece of shit,

933
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:09,457
whose only motive for suing
his ex is to get revenge.

934
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,849
- She broke our agreement.
- No, you broke your agreement

935
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,383
when you had an affair
for two months

936
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:14,848
and you thought you were
gonna leave her.

937
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,742
- That has nothing
to do with this suit.

938
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,436
- It's got everything
to do with this suit.

939
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:20,698
You see, you messed up.
You changed your mind

940
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,362
and you wouldn't
take no for an answer

941
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:23,827
when she ended it,
and that's why you've been

942
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,322
stalking her for the last year.

943
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,817
- I haven't been stalking her.

944
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,309
- Bang. Signed affidavits
one and two.

945
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,402
Unlike your
bullshit accusations,

946
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:34,331
I have actual proof
from the agency

947
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,823
that you hired to follow her,
to the guy at the news stand

948
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:40,221
who says you stand there half
the day watching her building.

949
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,281
- Jacob, is this true?

950
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:46,271
- It is true.
He knows it's true.

951
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:49,300
And that is a Class D
felony, Doctor.

952
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:52,220
I should have you arrested,

953
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:54,652
or maybe I'll just
go to the board,

954
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,244
have your license removed.

955
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:03,063
- We were going
to have a life together.

956
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,685
I planned everything out.

957
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:08,614
Where we were going to live,
how many kids we'd have,

958
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:11,076
where we'd go
on our anniversary.

959
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,710
And then I make a mistake,

960
00:36:12,711 --> 00:36:15,032
and the next thing I know,

961
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:17,624
my whole life was gone.

962
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,720
- We'll be dropping the suit.

963
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:29,702
- You looking for Oliver?

964
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:31,127
- Nathan, hey.

965
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:32,761
Uh, yeah, just had some things

966
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,716
that I wanted to run by him.

967
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,745
- On the Brooklyn Housing case
or on your prison lawsuit?

968
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,169
- Look, Nathan, I had to...

969
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,634
- Mike, come on, relax.

970
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,588
I'm not angry.

971
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:48,956
Though I do wish I had a picture
of your face right now.

972
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,707
- What tipped you off?
- Come on, are you kidding me?

973
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:53,042
I mean, the second you signed
that agreement,

974
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,507
I knew you'd go back on it.

975
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:56,071
- So then why didn't
you say anything?

976
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:57,168
- Because this time
you're screwing over

977
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:59,560
Harvey Specter and not me.

978
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:00,925
Look, you're either
gonna win this thing

979
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:02,489
and we're gonna get
all the credit,

980
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,045
or you're gonna get caught
with your hand

981
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,579
in the cookie jar,
and we'll drop the case.

982
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,173
I have no downside.

983
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,037
- Does Oliver know?

984
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:10,463
- Yeah, yeah, I pretended
to be pissed at him

985
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,027
and sent him home.

986
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,960
Look, Mike,
why don't you take the night

987
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:16,521
and think about how much
respect you just gained for me,

988
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:18,575
then come back
and kill it in the morning.

989
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:20,508
- Thanks, Nathan.

990
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:22,203
- You're welcome, Mike.

991
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,594
- Donna, before you
go home tonight,

992
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,587
I need you to cut me
a check for Holly.

993
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:31,411
- What do you mean? I'm gonna
put her on the payroll.

994
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:33,075
- She doesn't want
to work here anymore.

995
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,108
Said she'd rather do
one-off jobs if at all.

996
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:37,400
Here's the amount.

997
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:39,194
- I don't understand.
I was good with having her.

998
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:42,951
- Well, whatever you said made
her not good with having us.

999
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:45,482
- Harvey, we're
a tight-knit group.

1000
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,008
We don't betray each other

1001
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,439
and we don't keep secrets
from each other.

1002
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,904
I had to find out
where she stood.

1003
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:52,528
And if the cost of that
was her not coming here,

1004
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:53,794
then I don't regret it.

1005
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,159
- I understand, Donna.

1006
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,455
I'm not coming down on you.

1007
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:57,881
I just need the check.

1008
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,385
- Harvey, is there something

1009
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:01,339
that you're not telling me
about this woman?

1010
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,441
'Cause it seems like you've
been different lately,

1011
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,334
and... I don't know.

1012
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:06,899
- It's nothing about this woman.

1013
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,424
I just thought she'd be
a good addition.

1014
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:09,958
These things happen.

1015
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,752
- It's funny.

1016
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:14,413
I love my new position,
but I miss this.

1017
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:16,936
- I miss it, too.

1018
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,735
- You want me to pour us
a couple drinks?

1019
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,390
- Maybe tomorrow night.

1020
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,293
I have something I have
to deal with right now.

1021
00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:24,917
- Okay.

1022
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,350
I'll cut you that check.

1023
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:36,328
- You were right, Doc.

1024
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:40,246
I hadn't really dealt with Tara.

1025
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:42,776
But one thing is clear.

1026
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:45,269
The situation was my doing.

1027
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,321
Which means...

1028
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:52,921
I need to keep
working on myself,

1029
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:55,343
because...

1030
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:58,203
<i>I don't wanna mess things up
with the next Tara.</i>

1031
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:01,294
- Louis, typically I refrain

1032
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:05,757
from saying things like this
to my patients, but...

1033
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:08,310
I am proud of you.

1034
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,272
- Good night, Doc.

1035
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:15,595
<i>- Good night, Louis.</i>

1036
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:23,945
- Time for one more appointment?

1037
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,706
- Hello.
What are you doing here?

1038
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,769
- I wanted to take you out
and celebrate.

1039
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,562
Louis told me what happened.

1040
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:32,187
- I just got off
the phone with him.

1041
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:33,683
He did an amazing job.

1042
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:36,543
And you did an amazing job
recommending him.

1043
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:42,203
- Why didn't you tell me
about Jacob?

1044
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,096
- I asked Louis
not to tell you that.

1045
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,621
- Louis didn't tell me.
- Well, then how do you...

1046
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:47,615
- Because I do,
and all I could think of

1047
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,713
was I wish you trusted
me enough to know

1048
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:53,574
that I wouldn't go nuts on
this guy for what he did to you.

1049
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,497
- Is that why you think
I didn't tell you?

1050
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,131
- Well, you know my history
with infidelity.

1051
00:39:57,132 --> 00:39:59,125
What else could it be?

1052
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:02,682
- Harvey, the man cheated on me.

1053
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:07,137
I trusted him,
and he cheated on me,

1054
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,728
and I was afraid
of how you'd see me.

1055
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:12,789
- Why would him cheating on you
make me see you differently?

1056
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:16,116
- Because some people
think that a woman

1057
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:20,104
who can be cheated on
can't be...

1058
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,033
loveable.

1059
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,996
- How can you know me
and think that?

1060
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:28,055
- Well, it's not about you.
It's about me.

1061
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:29,650
- And if this guy
did this to you,

1062
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:32,540
then he's an idiot,
and all he did

1063
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:35,601
is lose out on something great.

1064
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,094
Not loveable?

1065
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:42,954
- Psychiatrists don't
know everything, you know.

1066
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:45,476

00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:21,961
- Back from where?

1077
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,854
Was it the nursing home
in Brooklyn

1078
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,917
or was it
the Department of Buildings?

1079
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:29,835
Because Oliver, he couldn't
seem to decide which.

1080
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:31,897
- Rachel, I didn't...
- Mike, if you can't tell me

1081
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:32,994
what's going on,
I'm gonna start to wonder

1082
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,888
what else you've been
keeping from me.

1083
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:37,388
- I wasn't lying about
working a case with Oliver.

1084
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,913
I just didn't tell you
which one.

1085
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,907
- The prison one.

1086
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,906
- Yeah.
- You signed an agreement.

1087
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:45,500
This is a fireable offense.

1088
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,593
- Harvey isn't gonna
fire me for...

1089
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:49,886
- Okay, but maybe he should.
- How can you say that?

1090
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:51,481
- Because you're taking
advantage of his trust,

1091
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:53,483
not to mention mine.

1092
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,406
- Rachel, these prisoners are
being exploited for money.

1093
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:57,201
- And you trying
to do the right thing

1094
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,403
doesn't change the fact
that you gave your word.

1095
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:02,193
- Rachel...
- Look...

1096
00:42:02,194 --> 00:42:04,754
We've been through enough
for you to know

1097
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,748
that I'm still gonna
love you in the morning,

1098
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:08,382
but you have to ask yourself:

1099
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:11,172
What is your word worth?

1100
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:12,837
'Cause with the way
things are going,

1101
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,730
it's not gonna be worth
very much.
