1
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:08,932
No, Mike, stop.

2
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,423
Whoa.

3
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,828
Smooth.

4
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,861
You woulda made
a nice ballerina.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,265
I'm not gonna apologize
for my lithe physique, okay?

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:18,897
And, by the way,
I was on the wrestling team

7
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,168
in high school, so...

8
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,081
Is something funny?

9
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,623
I'm just trying to imagine
you fighting someone.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,896
Oh-oh-oh. I would kill you.

11
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:29,633
- You wouldn't touch me.
- Why not?

12
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,704
Because you'd be too busy
staring at me in tights.

13
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:32,905
No, I wouldn't.

14
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:34,273
You're doing it right now.

15
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:35,710
You're not wearing any tights.

16
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,081
I'm not wearing any underwear.

17
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,983
I'm... you...

18
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,827
Okay, so, Mrs. Williams,

19
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:47,562
we're gonna take you
to the deposition

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,931
as soon as Kenny Verdasco's
finished, all right?

21
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,532
You two draw the short straw?

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,167
I'm sorry?

23
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,203
You're in charge of
corralling the cancer patients.

24
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,205
It's not the most glamorous
duty in the world.

25
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:58,908
I supposed you two
don't mind working together.

26
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,676
- How long you been dating?
- Oh!

27
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,346
No, no, I'm sort of
seeing someone...

28
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,915
It's gonna happen
sooner or later.

29
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,587
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me for a moment.

30
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,189
Yes?

31
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,961
Hi, I'm sorry,
I think I'm in the wrong place.

32
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,964
Are you here for the Emerson
Petroleum deposition?

33
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,667
No, no, I'm an old friend
of Harvey Specter's.

34
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,671
This place is huge.
I always get turned around.

35
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,007
Maybe you can point me
in the right direction.

36
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:19,342
Uh, no problem.

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,743
You just see
those doors right there?

38
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:21,645
Go through to the elevators,

39
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,080
then up two floors,

40
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,684
and then you're gonna
take a right,

41
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,852
and down the hall,
and you'll see Donna.

42
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,954
Donna. Great, thanks.

43
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,256
Travis Tanner.

44
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:29,724
Mike Ross. Good to meet you.

45
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:30,893
Pleasure to meet you too, Mike.

46
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,197
Take care.

47
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,667
My wife Emily and I,
we saved every dollar

48
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,136
I made in the army,

49
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:39,206
and we moved here from
Apple Creek, New York,

50
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:40,608
six years ago.

51
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,278
We bought a brownstone,

52
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,713
and planted a tomato garden.

53
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,082
We had barbecues
with the neighbors.

54
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,086
It was... it was
a dream come true.

55
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,757
After being diagnosed
with lung cancer,

56
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,292
I couldn't work anymore.

57
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,927
I mean, there's times
I have difficulty

58
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:56,962
even going up the stairs
to my daughter's room.

59
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,032
You attended Apple Creek
High School, is that right?

60
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,600
All four years.

61
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,903
Your high school was built
in 1985.

62
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,672
What was there before?

63
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,407
An oil well,

64
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:10,444
owned and operated
by Emerson Petroleum.

65
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:14,081
Now, Kenny, why was
the high school shut down?

66
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,849
Because 200 people
who taught at

67
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,684
or attended Apple Creek High
were diagnosed

68
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:20,053
with some form of cancer.

69
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,623
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

70
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,426
That's for you, Larry.

71
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,361
Trust me, it's good. Use it.

72
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:27,663
How do you know my name?

73
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,099
It's all in there, Larry.

74
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,604
Hey, are you Donna?

75
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,139
Yeah, can I help you?

76
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,908
Yeah, Mike Ross
told me to find you.

77
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,876
We were in the library and
one of the plaintiffs fainted,

78
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:40,178
hit their head. Oh, my gosh.

79
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,714
Okay, I'm on it. Thank you.

80
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,116
You're welcome.

81
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,824
Wrong office.

82
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,326
Harvey, I have to admit,
great job making Kenny Verdasco

83
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,161
the face of your
class action suit.

84
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,898
I don't know
who Kenny Verdasco is.

85
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,366
Oh, well, you better find out.

86
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,234
How 'bout for starters
you introduce yourself

87
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,070
or I'm calling security. Donna!

88
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,374
Relax, relax.
Name's Travis Tanner.

89
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:10,745
You're Travis Tanner?

90
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,214
You've heard of me.

91
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,316
No.

92
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:16,118
I'm a senior partner
with Clyde-MacPhee.

93
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,422
- We're based in Boston.
- So are the Red Sox.

94
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,690
I don't give a shit
about them either.

95
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:20,791
That's funny.

96
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,293
You know what's not funny,

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,028
is what's happening
to Kenny Verdasco.

98
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,164
At this moment, they're
asking him about his parents,

99
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:29,234
both heavy smokers.
Nasty habit.

100
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,437
Yes, a pack a day each.

101
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,272
I lived with them
till I was 18.

102
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,308
And then they'll ask
how in the army

103
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,045
he was exposed to nickel.
Chromium, and hydrocarbons.

104
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:40,881
I was an infantry soldier.

105
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:43,350
I didn't have much choice
in the matter.

106
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,520
Not to mention
the frivolous lawsuit

107
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:49,024
he filed ten years ago against
the Shriver Grocery chain.

108
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:50,459
It wasn't frivolous.

109
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,396
I slipped and shattered
my elbow.

110
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,498
If they're doing such
a great job down there,

111
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,367
what are you doing
up here in my office?

112
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,169
'Cause I gave them all that.

113
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,038
And when they walk
out that door,

114
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,107
I'm gonna be the one
who fires their asses.

115
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,176
So you coming to me
for a pep talk?

116
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,045
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

117
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,413
No, you see, Emerson Petroleum

118
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,115
was gonna lose this case.

119
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,217
So they called me in
to fix the situation.

120
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,453
And when I beat
Pearson Hardman,

121
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,289
I don't want anyone saying
it was because

122
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,824
they didn't send in their best.

123
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,392
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

124
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,527
but Jessica Pearson's
handling this case herself.

125
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,229
And if you think
that she's not the best,

126
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,897
why don't you take
a run at her and find out?

127
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,399
All right, look,
I hear what you're saying,

128
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,101
but here's the thing.

129
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,002
I know that you know who I am.

130
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,872
And I also know
that during your senior year

131
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,141
you missed out on playing
in the state championship

132
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,876
because of your shoulder.

133
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,011
You can't pitch
with a bad shoulder.

134
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,213
And what do you know,

135
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,915
they won without you, Harvey.

136
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,152
Now ask yourself something.

137
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,054
Are you gonna let
Jessica Pearson

138
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,121
play the big game for you, hmm?

139
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,226
What's so funny?

140
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,927
I'm just thinking
about how I'm gonna enjoy

141
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,095
kicking your ass.

142
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,431
I'll see you in court.

153
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,449
everything I care about.

154
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,051
I told you this was coming.

155
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,853
They're just trying
to rattle you.

156
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,521
Yeah, well, they're doing
a hell of a good job.

157
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,357
Kenny, you're our
lead plaintiff.

158
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:47,892
You've got to keep
your composure.

159
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,327
I don't care about composure.

160
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,828
I want to make a settlement.

161
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,263
That's exactly what they want.

162
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,698
Kenny, I'd like you to meet
Harvey Specter.

163
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,133
He's my right hand.

164
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,401
Can your right hand
please tell me why

165
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,936
we shouldn't ask
for a settlement?

166
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,238
I'm not against
settling one bit.

167
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,439
But if we go to them,
we're weak.

168
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:01,741
They come to us, we're strong.

169
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,376
Harvey's right.

170
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,011
They came after you because
they're running scared.

171
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,714
Trust me, they'll come
to us soon enough.

172
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,483
Okay.

173
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,318
One more thing,

174
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm gonna postpone
the rest of the depositions.

175
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:16,756
Don't tell the rest of the
plaintiffs what happened.

176
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,893
What the hell was that?

177
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,861
I need you to let me
take over this case.

178
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,896
The guy that came into
my deposition.

179
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,798
- He called you out?
- Yeah.

180
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,132
- He's good.
- Yeah.

181
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,967
You think I can't take him?

182
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,368
He brought up
the state championship.

183
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,738
- Oh, shoulder.
- Yeah.

184
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,474
Oh, take him.

185
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,911
- Be careful.
- I will.

186
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,512
Bringing up
state championships,

187
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,514
that's just... that's wrong.

188
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,083
Nothing I wouldn't have done.

189
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,751
♪ ♪

190
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,291
Thanks.

191
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:54,260
I need you to dig into
Travis Tanner.

192
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:55,761
Find out where he's worked,
where he's gone to school,

193
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:57,095
what cases he's won.

194
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,196
Why, you thinking
about starting

195
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,065
a Wikipedia page for him?

196
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:01,933
I don't know anything about
how this guy operates.

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,401
And before I make a move,
I need to know everything

198
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,069
about how this guy operates.

199
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,271
Right, for his Wikipedia page.

200
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,039
You think the Mavericks
didn't watch game film

201
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,274
on Lebron before
they played the Heat?

202
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:11,842
You're Harvey Specter.

203
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,543
You don't need
to watch game film.

204
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,279
Do you know who's watched
more game film than anybody?

205
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,314
- No. Who?
- Michael Jordan.

206
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,883
What? How do you know that?

207
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:23,355
You don't believe me?
Let's call him.

208
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:25,425
You have Michael Jordan's
phone number.

209
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:26,993
Yep.

210
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:28,428
If I hit this button
right here,

211
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:30,030
I call Michael Jordan?

212
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:32,233
That's kinda how a phone works.

213
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,568
Speed dial 23.

214
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,270
- I'm doing it.
- Go for it.

215
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,172
I'm gonna ask him
about baseball.

216
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,874
Do not ask him about baseball.

217
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,542
Ahh! Wrong... wrong number.

218
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,511
You're kidding me.

219
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,013
Oh, my God.

220
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,149
Who are you?

221
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,318
Everybody stop
what you're doing,

222
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,322
stand up, and follow me
in the library.

223
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,257
Mike, that goes for you too,
up and at 'em.

224
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,925
Uh, yeah, Louis, I'd love to,

225
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:57,960
but I have some work
to do for...

226
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,395
His majesty can wait.

227
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:00,896
All associates
in the library now.

228
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,866
Let's go.

229
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:06,269
Let's go.

230
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:07,837
Rumor is we're getting
our annual raises early.

231
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,338
People are freaking out.

232
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,340
That's great, Harold.

233
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,941
I'm thinking about
getting a tattoo.

234
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,077
You need a raise for that?

235
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,512
I'm really overpaying
for my apartment.

236
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,147
Good morning, everyone.

237
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,615
Many of you seem to think

238
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,984
this is about
getting your raises early.

239
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,952
- It isn't.
- Suck.

240
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,188
We've discovered a breach
at the firm.

241
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,558
A confidential witness list
was leaked to a rival firm,

242
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,460
Wakefield-Cady.

243
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,028
Now it's entirely possible

244
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,996
that this was
an honest mistake.

245
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,598
If so, we urge
the responsible party

246
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,233
to come forward.

247
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,536
If not, we'll find out
soon enough.

248
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,373
Either way, we will get
to the bottom of this.

249
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,876
Louis.

250
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,119
Jessica seems to think
a mistake's been made.

251
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:59,454
I don't believe so.

252
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,257
I also don't believe
this is a matter of ethics.

253
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,693
It's a matter of loyalty.

254
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,429
Someone in this room
has betrayed us all,

255
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:10,232
and it makes me sick.

256
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,769
The fact that it went to those
holier-than-thou pricks

257
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:17,606
at Wakefield-Cady, you know
what, that makes me sicker.

258
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,575
Now, you all work together,

259
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,677
in the trenches,
shoulder-to-shoulder,

260
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:25,214
which means one of you
must know who did this.

261
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:27,616
Now if y'all harbor knowledge
of the perpetrator

262
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:29,651
and do not turn him in,

263
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,553
you're as bad
as the perpetrator himself,

264
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,454
you along with the perpetrator
will be fired.

265
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,556
He's doing George W. Bush.

266
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,391
You're either with us
or against us, folks.

267
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,360
He sounds like Bush,
but he looks just like Cheney.

268
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:45,065
You got something
to tell me, Harold?

269
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,533
- Uh-uh.
- No?

270
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,268
Not that dermatological problem

271
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,669
that you were talking
about earlier in my office?

272
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,271
No, not that one? No.

273
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:53,606
To show you how serious I am,

274
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,441
I have an incentive.

275
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,643
Whoever turns this traitor in

276
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:01,980
receives $10,000.

277
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:05,250
You're welcome.

278
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,785
Feel free to go back to work.

279
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,954
$10,000, that's a big tattoo.

280
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:13,291
Yeah, it'd be huge.

281
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,327
Why?

282
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,629
- Louis, there was a...
- I don't care.

283
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,231
Tell me what you learned
about Travis Tanner.

284
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,733
It's all in there.

285
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,401
Travis Tanner went to Yale,

286
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,170
undergrad in law,
honors in both.

287
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,139
He was a junior tennis champion.

288
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,141
Tennis. Just like Louis.

289
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,610
Yeah, he played in college too.

290
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,412
- Oh, my God.
- More importantly,

291
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:34,348
he was the youngest senior
partner at Clyde-MacPhee.

292
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,216
This guy's record
is off the charts.

293
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,784
Really?

294
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,686
He specializes in breaking
class action lawsuits.

295
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,354
Harris Tobacco, Bell Pesticide,

296
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:43,523
Gravtech Securities,
he broke 'em all.

297
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,259
How come I've
never heard of him?

298
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:48,327
Evidentially, he doesn't
like to take public credit.

299
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,097
Stays off the radar,
he avoids the press.

300
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,533
I only found this stuff by
looking through court records.

301
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,069
Now it makes sense.

302
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,504
What?

303
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,105
Why he thinks I know him.

304
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,874
I know those other attorneys.

305
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,609
He thinks they've
told me about him.

306
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:02,844
- They never did?
- No.

307
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,880
- Why not?
- Because he beat them.

308
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:07,383
This guy's kind of a badass.

309
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,751
You want me to get you
an autograph?

310
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,454
No, I'm just
respecting our foe.

311
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,390
- Foe?
- It's from <i>The Art of War.</i>

312
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,658
No?

313
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:16,360
No, look, I need to know

314
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,162
how those other cases
are different from ours.

315
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,531
Well, those other cases
were spread out

316
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,800
geographically,
economically, socially.

317
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,568
Ours is in a single town,

318
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:28,538
a single school with
a single cluster of plaintiffs.

319
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:33,043
That tennis-playing douchebag
Travis Tanner's on the phone.

320
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,478
You know I listen.

321
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:40,717
Travis, what can I do for you?

322
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,686
Yeah, I'm happy
to discuss the case,

323
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,588
on one condition.

324
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:47,391
You're gonna meet me
at Apple Creek High School.

325
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,193
See you in an hour.

326
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,694
Why do you want to meet there?

327
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,529
Because that's ground zero.

328
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,430
And I want the emotion
of that school under my feet

329
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:55,832
when I negotiate.

330
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:57,667
I thought you were
against emotions.

331
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,101
I'm against having emotions,

332
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,769
not against using them.

333
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,604
Come on, I thought
we were homies.

334
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,573
Jimmy, I didn't leak anything.

335
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,241
You know, I remember you said

336
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,942
you hated Louis Litt
and you were second-guessing

337
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,544
your decision
to become a lawyer.

338
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,646
I told you that in confidence
over six cosmopolitans.

339
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,682
It doesn't mean
you're not the guy.

340
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,750
Harold, really?
You drink cosmopolitans?

341
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,319
Stop doing that
unless you're with girls,

342
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,654
which you never are.

343
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:19,622
And, Jimmy, are you kidding me,

344
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,157
going after Harold?

345
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,425
What, how do you know
he didn't do it?

346
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,560
How do we know
you didn't do it?

347
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,228
Maybe you're the guy.

348
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,730
Oh, my God, guys,
this is ridiculous.

349
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,365
All right, has it occurred
to any of you

350
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,967
that maybe this is all
just a big test?

351
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,702
Wow, wow, spoken like a person

352
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,537
with something to hide.

353
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,606
Louis was talking
about loyalty.

354
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:37,808
Maybe this is just some test
to see how loyal we are

355
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,277
by not turning on each other.
Are you kidding?

356
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,378
Jessica would never play along
with something like that.

357
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:42,979
Even if it's not a test,

358
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,413
this is a law office,
not <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

359
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:47,149
Everybody get back to work.

360
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:53,088
Are these the Galusska briefs?

361
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,859
You guys, Louis has been
hounding us for these.

362
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,829
Why hasn't anyone
taken them to him?

363
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,698
Are you serious?

364
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:05,503
Wow. You're scared of him.

365
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,338
He's Louis Litt,
he's not Darth Vader.

366
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,874
This is what courage looks like.
Jimmy, pay attention.

367
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,743
Please.

368
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,345
Louis, the Galusska briefs.

369
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,213
Sorry they're late.

370
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,783
Hmm, only two days late.

371
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,999
- Sure you're ready for this?
- I'm here, aren't I?

372
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,434
I've been looking into you.
You're an elusive man.

373
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,002
Yeah, well,
when you're number one,

374
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,937
you don't need to broadcast
your victories, Harvey.

375
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,739
That's funny.
Where I come from,

376
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,841
number one doesn't usually
challenge number two

377
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,743
to a fight.

378
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,911
This school
was Apple Creek's pride.

379
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,947
Parents felt safe sending
their children here,

380
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,048
and teachers felt safe
teaching here.

381
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,351
You know what Apple Creek
High School is now?

382
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,286
A bunch of trailers
on the outskirts of town.

383
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,055
All because 30 years ago
your clients failed

384
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,890
to cap an oil well
and gave them all cancer.

385
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,625
You see all these
power lines around here?

386
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,493
They crisscross
the entire town.

387
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,495
Two miles down that road,
paint factory.

388
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,030
You got a microwave tower.

389
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:14,732
And all this grass
that you see?

390
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,533
It's been treated
with pesticide every week

391
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,302
for 20 years.

392
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:20,270
You say it's our fault.
I say you're wrong.

393
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,373
That office, Mitch Rosewall,

394
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,443
soccer coach, brain cancer.

395
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:27,978
Library, Monica Dodd,
volunteer.

396
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:30,981
She ran it for years.
Stomach cancer.

397
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,882
They both died last month,

398
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,484
and they sure as hell didn't
die from pesticide.

399
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:36,019
- Can you prove it?
- If we go to trial,

400
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,622
it won't be
about proving anything.

401
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,326
It'll be about Monica,
Mitch, and Kenny,

402
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,295
and you won't stand a chance.

403
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:47,866
Ah, this is fun, Harvey.

404
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,968
I'm just sorry to say

405
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,337
that we won't get
to do this in court.

406
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,806
Against my advice,
Emerson wants to settle.

407
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,341
You're kidding me.

408
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,043
After all this,
you want to settle.

409
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,313
No, I don't,
but those are my instructions.

410
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,749
Call it a draw.

411
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,760
Mike, get over
to Kenny's house.

412
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,429
Tanner's gonna try
and make him cave.

413
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:31,959
I came as soon
as I got the message.

414
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,195
Kenny.

415
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:36,231
It's Harvey Specter.

416
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,668
Was Travis Tanner here?
I was just with him.

417
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,603
He couldn't have beaten
me by much.

418
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:42,037
Sweetie, why don't
you go inside, okay, baby?

419
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,140
Okay.

420
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,008
No, it wasn't him.

421
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,210
It was someone else.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

422
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,211
He said he was
with Pearson-Hardman,

423
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,279
so I let him in.

424
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,114
Did he mention Tanner's name?

425
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:53,315
No, but it was obvious
that's who he worked for.

426
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,583
He said me
and the other plaintiffs

427
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,251
were gonna get
a settlement offer soon.

428
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,986
- What else?
- He said if we don't take it,

429
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,354
that they're gonna go after us.

430
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:00,988
That they have dirt
on everyone.

431
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:01,956
He mentioned
Eva Williams' arrest

432
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,458
for public intoxication,

433
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:04,559
Bernie Rutherford's
shoplifting arrest

434
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:05,827
when he was in college.

435
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,396
That's criminal intimidation.

436
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:08,597
If they want
to go after me, that's fine.

437
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,232
I can handle it.

438
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,668
But the others,
I don't know if they can.

439
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,137
You have to stay strong, Kenny.

440
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,205
You cave,
everything falls apart.

441
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:17,907
One more thing,
what did this guy look like?

442
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,609
I don't know,
he was average height,

443
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,378
brown hair, brown eyes.

444
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,280
Thanks.

445
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,281
Want me to start figuring out
who this guy is?

446
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,784
No. We'll never find him.

447
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,994
How'd you know Tanner
was going after Kenny?

448
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,195
'Cause if I was the type
to go out of bounds,

449
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:43,430
that's exactly what I'd do.

450
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:45,566
- You're not?
- No.

451
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:47,401
So what's our next move?

452
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:48,502
I'm calling in reinforcements.

453
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,171
What do you mean?

454
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:52,440
If Tanner sent a guy
to intimidate Kenny,

455
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:54,042
he's got something else
up his sleeve,

456
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,011
and I want to know what it is.

457
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,780
What?

458
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:00,517
Nothing, you guys are like
two sides of the same coin.

459
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,619
What are you saying,
he's another me?

460
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,787
No one is another me.

461
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,589
I mean, you told Donna
I was another you.

462
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,357
I never said that.

463
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,425
You said you were looking
for another you,

464
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:13,094
and then you hired me.

465
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,663
So see how that works?

466
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:18,299
Logic.

467
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,138
Mike, let's go.
In my office now.

468
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,409
Oh, damn, Mike.

469
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,645
Tell me you didn't
leak the documents, man.

470
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:33,180
Are you our Benedict Arnold?

471
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:34,781
Benedict Arnold,
nice reference.

472
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,116
You helping your
high school girlfriend

473
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:37,117
with her homework again?

474
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:38,586
Okay, not cool, Mike.

475
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,687
You know Darla's
in community college.

476
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,057
I don't even know why
you laughing, Harold.

477
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:46,059
You don't have a chick.

478
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,294
She's of age.

479
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,601
I am so very proud
of you, Mike.

480
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,804
Wow, I really wish you
weren't touching me right now.

481
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:59,373
You are what loyalty
looks like.

482
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,409
You rooted out
the person responsible

483
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:04,245
for leaking the witness list
to Wakefield-Cady.

484
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,548
Louis, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

485
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,016
It was almost cute
how you hid the evidence

486
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,585
in the Galusska briefs.

487
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,053
Like you didn't want
to take the credit.

488
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,655
What?
Louis, I didn't hide anything.

489
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:15,191
Don't worry, no one's
gonna label you a snitch.

490
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,793
Snitch?

491
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,561
We didn't even think
to check the fax machines.

492
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,430
That was brilliant.

493
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:23,466
The list was sent from
right here in this firm.

494
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,735
This is a copy
of a fax submission form

495
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,536
sent from three days ago.

496
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:29,138
This doesn't implicate anybody.

497
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,107
That's the confidential
employee code.

498
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:33,442
She must not have known
that the machine recorded it.

499
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,710
She?

500
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,145
Wait, why am I being suspended?

501
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:37,579
I didn't leak any documents.

502
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:41,183
Who told Louis I did this?

503
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,384
Get your arms...
No, no, no, Louis.

504
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,821
You have to stop this.
I didn't turn Rachel in.

505
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,556
That's so sweet
how you didn't really mean

506
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,092
to hand someone in.

507
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,193
Wait, Mike, stop.

508
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,162
You did a great thing.

509
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,899
And because
of that great thing,

510
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,369
$10,000, and don't spend
it in one place.

511
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,242
You say, "Thank you, Louis."

512
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,344
And then,
"You're welcome, Mike."

513
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,678
- Rachel.
- I don't want to talk to you.

514
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,614
- Hey, come on.
- You want "Come on"?

515
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,616
Why would you do that to me?
I didn't do anything to you.

516
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,784
I didn't fax that goddamn list.

517
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,352
And I didn't turn you in.

518
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,787
Then why was I just
suspended, Mike?

519
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,722
All I know is that I gave
Louis a stack of briefs

520
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,224
and there was some fax with
your confidential code on it.

521
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,826
Do you think that if I was
gonna leak firm documents,

522
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,894
I'd be dumb enough to fax
them with my own code?

523
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,630
No, I don't,
but whoever did this

524
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,764
must have framed you.

525
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,232
Yeah, well, it worked.

526
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,600
Rachel, look, you just...

527
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,235
they're gonna investigate this.

528
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,603
They're gonna clear your name,
you know that.

529
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,304
I've worked there
for five years,

530
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,273
and this is how they treat me?

531
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,175
I'm suspended, Mike.

532
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,309
I'm probably gonna be fired.

533
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:40,745
I should sue them.

534
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,514
Okay, let's not
do anything rash, okay?

535
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,549
It's not rash.
It's standing up for myself.

536
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,384
Rachel, you...

537
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,988
you're over-react...

538
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,969
Excuse me.

539
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,338
You wouldn't happen to know
what sort of wine

540
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,172
pairs well with
a Duck I'Orange, would you?

541
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,874
Try something
with a full fruit flavor,

542
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,243
like a cabernet sauvignon.

543
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:13,813
Eh, sauvignons are a little
bit oaky for my palate.

544
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,782
This article right here

545
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,385
is all about the resurgence
of Pinot Noir.

546
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:27,728
You know, you could just pay me
right out in public.

547
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,430
But then I wouldn't
feel like James Bond.

548
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:30,731
Oh, who's that make me?

549
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,466
Pussy Galore.

550
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:33,868
Octopussy?

551
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,204
That's enough, Harvey.

552
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,638
What do you have for me?

553
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:40,441
Nothing.
On paper, Tanner's clean.

554
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,777
He may break the rules,
but he covers his tracks.

555
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:45,446
You've never come up
empty for me before.

556
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:47,014
I didn't this time either.

557
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:48,616
Tanner booked a conference room

558
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,584
at the Waldorf
tomorrow at noon.

559
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,687
Divide and conquer.

560
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,588
He's gonna gather
my plaintiffs,

561
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:58,459
scare them, and then
give them a lowball offer.

562
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:01,562
And that's illegal.

563
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,997
What?

564
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,466
You've used me
for a lot of things.

565
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:06,701
You've never asked
me to investigate

566
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,369
another attorney before.

567
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:10,872
This guy's good.

568
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,541
If he called your plaintiffs,

569
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,809
I can get his phone records
to prove it.

570
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:15,611
He didn't make
those calls himself.

571
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,683
He's not gonna be
at the Waldorf either tomorrow.

572
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,218
But I will.

573
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:29,342
Donna, can you tell me

574
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,110
about these confidential
employee codes

575
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:33,264
that Louis says Rachel used
to fax the witness list

576
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,328
over to Wakefield-Cady?

577
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,163
I have a thousand things
to do before lunch.

578
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,865
Hold Mike's hand
while he crosses the street,

579
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,233
not one of them.

580
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:41,002
Donna, this one's for Rachel.

581
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,904
What do you need?

582
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,206
I know we use the billing
codes to charge the clients,

583
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,808
but what do we use
the employee codes for?

584
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,309
They're special codes
for when you need to use

585
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:48,511
the firm's resources
for personal reasons.

586
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,113
We can do that?

587
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,581
- You can't, but Rachel can.
- Why?

588
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,416
Because a fifth-year paralegal

589
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:55,551
is more valuable to the firm
than a first-year associate.

590
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,586
Okay, so do you have
a personal code?

591
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:00,255
- I have two.
- So where do you get them?

592
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:02,290
They're generated
by the I.T. Department.

593
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,025
We have an I.T. Department?

594
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,960
The computers
don't run themselves.

595
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,596
At least until Skynet
goes active.

596
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,364
Sarah Connor.

597
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,034
No.

598
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,437
- No, I'll work on that.
- Really bad.

599
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:17,371
Yeah.

600
00:22:24,112 --> 00:22:26,281
What?

601
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:35,390
Uh, hi, excuse me.
I'm looking for Benjamin.

602
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,992
You found him.

603
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,160
Oh, great, I'm Mike Ross.

604
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:39,895
We just spoke on the phone.

605
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:42,165
Man, this place is like
<i>Battlestar Galactica.</i>

606
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,866
Where do you guys
keep the Cylons?

607
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,302
What do they pay you guys?

608
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:46,503
Pearson-Hardman
takes care of us

609
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:48,071
because we're on call 24/7.

610
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,239
If a server goes down

611
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:51,041
or a partner's computer crashes,

612
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,410
people die.

613
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,078
That's a little dramatic,
don't you think, Ben?

614
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,080
It's Benjamin.

615
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:58,514
I'm sure you don't like it
when people call you Mike.

616
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:00,116
Actually, I prefer Mike.

617
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:02,652
Well, Mike, six months ago

618
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
I was at Connolly White,
the network went haywire,

619
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:07,022
and we were in a breach
of contract litigation

620
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,291
worth $400 million.

621
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,892
They needed it fixed
in an hour.

622
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,394
No one thought
it could be done.

623
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,396
I had the network up and
running again in 23 minutes.

624
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,499
Is that dramatic
enough for you?

625
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:18,401
Wow, you're like
a regular Zuckerberg.

626
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,603
Z-zuckerberg?

627
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:24,474
Zuckerberg couldn't code
his way out of a paper bag.

628
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,376
You called about
the employee codes.

629
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:28,712
You're a first year.
You can't have one, sorry.

630
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,081
Okay, well, I don't need one.

631
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:32,616
I just want to know
if it's possible

632
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,586
for someone to gain access
to somebody else's code.

633
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:37,354
Sure. For one person, me.

634
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:39,357
I have access
to all of the codes.

635
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:42,459
Okay, so in your short
tenure here,

636
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,928
has anyone ever
asked you for access

637
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:47,131
to someone else's code?

638
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,266
Once. Last week.

639
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,601
- Who?
- I can't tell you that.

640
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,102
Why not?

641
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,470
I.T. Officer/client privilege.

642
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,106
Does that even exist, Ben?

643
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,641
It does in here.

644
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:06,149
All right, Ben,
why don't we make a bet?

645
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:08,585
I think you mean a wager,
Michael.

646
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah, sure.

647
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:13,156
I'm gonna tell you every single
number on this piece of paper,

648
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:15,958
and you're gonna
give me that name.

649
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:18,060
And if you can't?

650
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:22,598
Then I'm gonna give you
this check for 10 grand.

651
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,601
You get one number, one comma,
one decimal point wrong,

652
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,204
and that money is mine.

653
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:30,940
Oh, and when I win,

654
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,241
I'll also take
one of those computers.

655
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,676
And for the record,

656
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:37,346
there's not
a single comma on there.

657
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,448
You ready?

658
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,022
Rachel, it's Mike.

659
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,159
I figured out who leaked
the list to Wakefield-Cady.

660
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:52,695
It was Louis. Call me back.

661
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,443
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.
I'm here for my job interview.

662
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,312
- Welcome to Wakefield-Cady.
- Thank you.

663
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:17,686
Okay, as soon as we get inside

664
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:20,156
I need you to find
every plaintiff you interviewed

665
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:22,358
and tell them they're here
under false pretenses.

666
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:24,060
- Done.
- Kenny's meeting us here.

667
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:26,796
We need him to identify
the man who came to see him,

668
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:28,164
and we're gonna wait
for that guy to approach

669
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:29,666
any of our plaintiffs.

670
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,234
And if we connect
that guy to Tanner,

671
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:33,270
then we have him
on criminal intimidation.

672
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:35,372
And Emerson Petroleum will
have no choice but to settle.

673
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,640
Hey, Kenny. Good to see you.

674
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,241
This is gonna be fun.

675
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:43,312
You were right,

676
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:45,614
he called every one of them.

677
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,982
You see the guy?

678
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,317
No.

679
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:51,385
Start looking.

680
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,789
Mrs. Williams,
do you remember me?

681
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,090
I'm Mike Ross, from the office.

682
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:57,859
I remember you.

683
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:00,362
Do you mind if I ask you
what you're doing here today?

684
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,197
We were invited to come
and hear a settlement offer.

685
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,433
Really?

686
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,637
Um, excuse me
just for a minute.

687
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,141
He came here himself.

688
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,710
Big mistake.

689
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,311
Sorry to ruin
your little brunch,

690
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:17,713
but I think you know damn well

691
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:20,315
that you can't legally
address my clients.

692
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:23,484
Hey, I just came for the juice.

693
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:24,518
Mmm.

694
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:26,320
Pulp free.

695
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:29,123
I know I can't talk
to your clients directly.

696
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,157
But thank God
you're here, Harv.

697
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:35,362
Because what I can do
is I can talk to you.

698
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,298
Harvey, Emerson Petroleum

699
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:42,369
is offering $25,000 to each
and every one of your clients.

700
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,904
They don't take that,

701
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,872
this trial stretches out
for years.

702
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,274
Cross-examinations
will be brutal.

703
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:50,143
You take our settlement,

704
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,880
and this whole thing
will be gone tomorrow.

705
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:56,650
Now if any of your clients

706
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:58,486
want to get in touch with me,

707
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,222
here's my number.

708
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:07,163
Mr. Ross.

709
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,433
Harvey.

710
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,802
Erase that number.

711
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,404
You're not gonna get away
with what you're doing.

712
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:16,072
You know that, right?

713
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,707
What?

714
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:19,443
I just addressed you
with a raised voice.

715
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:21,345
Sometimes my ears
aren't so good.

716
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:23,580
If other people heard me,
I apologize, Harvey.

717
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:24,915
I'm just glad
you were smart enough

718
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:26,316
to figure out
I booked the Waldorf.

719
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,955
Mmm, I think I need
to take this.

720
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:33,790
I'm guessing
it's one of your clients

721
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:35,825
wanting to take
my settlement offer.

722
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:37,927
Hello.

723
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:42,097
Tanner. I'm coming after you.

724
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:44,066
Oh, I got your number.

725
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,623
Plaintiffs are scared.

726
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:03,827
They're talking about accepting
Tanner's lowball offer.

727
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,430
Those floodgates open
and we're done.

728
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:07,564
That's why I went
to go see Clarkson.

729
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:08,966
The legal finance guys?

730
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,401
If we can get
our plaintiffs a loan

731
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:12,102
against a future jury award,

732
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,870
it'll close the floodgates
and buy us more time.

733
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:15,606
Those loans
aren't cheap, Harvey.

734
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:17,040
Well, it's better than settling

735
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:19,509
for pennies on the dollar.

736
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,511
- Then do it.
- I tried,

737
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:23,647
but they won't give us anything
without collateral.

738
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:26,049
They don't think you can win.

739
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:27,517
They're wrong.

740
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:29,752
That's what I like to hear.

741
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,421
I need a million dollars
to get that loan.

742
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:33,889
Are you talking
about firm money?

743
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:36,092
- Yeah.
- No way that happens.

744
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,560
You don't think I'm a good bet?

745
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,827
That has nothing to do with it.

746
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:39,828
This was your case.

747
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:41,663
And I gave it to you to win.

748
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,865
Which I will do if you just
show some faith in me.

749
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,433
You can have my faith,

750
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,103
but you're not
getting my money.

751
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,770
♪ ♪

752
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:00,113
What are you doing here?

753
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,082
I left you three messages.

754
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,817
Louis framed you.
We can take him down.

755
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:05,585
I don't want
to take him down, Mike.

756
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:06,787
Why not?

757
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:08,655
Because I want a fresh start.

758
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:10,657
So you don't wanna work
at Pearson-Hardman anymore?

759
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,492
I applied for a job
at Wakefield-Cady.

760
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,660
They offered it to me
in the room.

761
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,028
I start Monday.

762
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,597
You took a job at the company

763
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:17,831
that ended up
with the leaked list?

764
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,132
Do you know
what that looks like?

765
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,567
I don't care
what it looks like.

766
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,069
I'm not guilty,
and I need a job.

767
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,071
So the going gets rough,
and you just quit?

768
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,640
No, I'm not quitting.
I was fired, remember?

769
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,975
No, you were suspended,

770
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,577
and you could still
save your job.

771
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,545
If Louis wants me gone,
I'm gone.

772
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:32,613
Rachel, Louis tried
to frame me once,

773
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:33,981
and I fought back.

774
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:35,082
Why aren't you doing
the same thing?

775
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,850
Because except for you,

776
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,952
no one from Pearson-Hardman
has contacted me at all.

777
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,088
Why would I fight
to stay there?

778
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,190
They're accusing me
of spilling secrets?

779
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,491
I'll show 'em spilling secrets.

780
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,727
I'll tell
Wakefield-Cady everything.

781
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:49,962
I may not have
a photographic memory, Mike,

782
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,032
but I sure as hell know a lot.

783
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,434
Rachel.

784
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,842
Moneypenny.

785
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,544
- Don't call me that.
- Why not?

786
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:07,079
Because she had
a thing for him.

787
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:08,446
This is the other way around.

788
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:10,282
You don't like me?

789
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,616
Like you enough
to give you this.

790
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,751
What's that?

791
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,087
I tapped the phones
at Emerson Petroleum.

792
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,789
This is a conference call
between Travis Tanner

793
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:20,658
and several high-ranking
Emerson executives.

794
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,593
I hope they're talking about
more than just the weather.

795
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,561
They're talking about Tanner
intimidating your client.

796
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,096
Both you and I know
that without a warrant

797
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:28,098
this recording's
not admissible in court.

798
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,701
It is if you testify that you
don't know where it came from.

799
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:33,837
Why'd you do this?

800
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:37,708
Because you need it.

801
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:41,578
I'm not gonna commit perjury
to win a case.

802
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,086
Oh, weird, look what I found.

803
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,655
Oh.

804
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:55,724
You are a prince among men.

805
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,326
I don't understand
why you use skim milk

806
00:30:57,393 --> 00:30:59,995
and then put whipped cream
and sugar in it.

807
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:02,263
Because I use skim milk,

808
00:31:02,331 --> 00:31:04,866
I can put whipped cream
and sugar in it.

809
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:07,935
Ah.

810
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,537
What's wrong?

811
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:12,740
- Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

812
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:16,711
Last week Louis got
Rachel's confidential code

813
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,079
from the I.T. Department.

814
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:20,015
And?

815
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,951
And it's a smoking gun.

816
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:24,020
He's the one that set her up.

817
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,855
Why would Louis
betray the firm?

818
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:27,724
I don't know,
maybe he's still upset

819
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,326
that he got passed over
for senior partner

820
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:30,994
and leaked the list
before he jumped ship.

821
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,029
Mike, Louis is a lot of things,

822
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:34,931
but he's not a traitor.

823
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,733
That man bleeds
Pearson-Hardman.

824
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,967
He's probably wearing
Pearson-Hardman underwear

825
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,369
right now.

826
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:40,938
I went to the tennis club
with him.

827
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:42,205
Trust me, he doesn't
wear underwear.

828
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,974
I care about Rachel too.

829
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:47,244
Louis didn't do this.

830
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:50,714
Okay.

831
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:52,316
And if you ever mention.

832
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:54,118
Louis' underwear situation
to me again...

833
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,687
You're the one
that brought it up.

834
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:58,557
- Go.
- Okay.

835
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,261
74 plaintiffs.

836
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,831
I can't believe they're willing
to cave for $25,000.

837
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,299
Slow down.

838
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,301
We need to figure out
how to beat Tanner.

839
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:10,737
Guy's been a step ahead of me
this entire time.

840
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,273
- It's pretty obvious why.
- Why?

841
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,041
You told me that you knew
he'd go to Kenny

842
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:16,642
because that's what you'd do,

843
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,344
if you were willing
to go out of bounds.

844
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:22,581
You anticipated him by
thinking about what you'd do.

845
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,183
And?

846
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,750
And that's exactly
what he's doing to you.

847
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,686
Maybe the only way
to get ahead of this guy

848
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:30,989
is to, I don't know, think
about what you wouldn't do.

849
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:33,925
Surprise myself. I like that.

850
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,393
You're welcome.

851
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:36,995
You wanna tell me
what you're doing?

852
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,664
Nope.

853
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:39,865
Doesn't seem fair to the person

854
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,267
whose idea it was.

855
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,036
You're gone.

856
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,409
- You wanted to talk, talk.
- I did.

857
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:52,079
I want to put
this competition aside,

858
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:53,680
call it a draw.

859
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:55,715
Tapping out, Harv?

860
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,150
This isn't about that.

861
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:58,951
This is about real people.

862
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,686
You make them
a reasonable offer,

863
00:33:00,754 --> 00:33:02,154
I'll get them to take it.

864
00:33:02,222 --> 00:33:04,023
Real people?

865
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,758
You're standing there
in a $12,000 suit

866
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:07,793
asking me not to do my job.

867
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,929
You care so much
about those real people,

868
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:11,797
I suggest you give them
your lunch money

869
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,131
but don't ask me for mine.

870
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:23,043
Vanessa, I'm gonna need
that wiretap after all.

871
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,743
- Is there any more of that?
- Last cup.

872
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:29,483
- Did you make...
- Nope.

873
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,252
Dude, that's common courtesy.

874
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,954
You finish a pot,
you make another one.

875
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:36,256
You gonna turn me
into Louis if I don't?

876
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:39,026
Hmm? Get me fired too?

877
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:42,395
Michael.

878
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,232
Benjamin,
you got something for me?

879
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,033
Wager's a wager, fair is fair.

880
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:49,135
Here's your GX-9000.

881
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:50,469
You're a good man.

882
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:53,105
Use it for porn, and I'll know.

883
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:54,607
Weird.

884
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:58,512
Hey, Louis, how you doing?

885
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,482
Why did Benjamin
just call you Louis?

886
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,017
I don't know. Made a mistake.

887
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:09,124
Oh.

888
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:12,094
No, he didn't.

889
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:16,198
He called you Louis because
he thinks you are Louis.

890
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:19,301
Because you posed as Louis
to get Rachel's employee code,

891
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:22,137
didn't you?

892
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:24,639
Look, Mike,
it's not what you think.

893
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:28,708
It's exactly what I think.

894
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,643
Go on. Start talking, Jimmy,

895
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,311
or I'll get get Benjamin

896
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,246
and we can all go see
Jessica together.

897
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:37,382
Listen.

898
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,817
Wakefield-Cady offered me
a junior partnership

899
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:41,586
if I leaked the witness list.

900
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:45,256
No, no, listen, Mike.
I have huge law school debts.

901
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,625
Okay? I mean, don't you?

902
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:49,627
I can't wait
for Pearson-Hardman

903
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:51,162
to make me a partner.

904
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,633
So what are you still
doing here then?

905
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,702
After I gave them the list,

906
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,304
they reneged on the offer.

907
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,739
Big surprise.

908
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,740
I didn't see that one coming.

909
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:07,078
Just don't turn me in, Mike,
please.

910
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,248
I came from nothing.

911
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,750
I worked my ass off
to get into Harvard Law

912
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,719
and become an associate here.

913
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:17,188
You know who else
worked their ass off?

914
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:20,091
Rachel Zane,
the paralegal who got fired

915
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,527
because of what you did.

916
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:23,729
I didn't know it was her code.

917
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,264
I just needed
some numbers, man.

918
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,633
I didn't think
I was gonna get caught.

919
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,037
Look, Mike, I made one mistake.

920
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:31,839
Okay?

921
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:34,208
I mean, haven't you
ever cut some corners?

922
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,911
Done some things you regretted?

923
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,387
Jimmy, I like you, man, okay?

924
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,455
But to clear Rachel's name,

925
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:51,425
they have to know
she wasn't the one.

926
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:54,227
If you come forward,

927
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:56,296
maybe they fire you.

928
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,465
If I turn you in,

929
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:02,102
it's gonna follow you
for the rest of your career.

930
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,538
It's up to you.

931
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,648
Harvey, I'm gonna
do you a favor.

932
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:15,050
Why don't you tell Mike Ross
to take a hike?

933
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:17,420
He can stay.

934
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:21,422
Okay.

935
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,791
You see, 95 of your plaintiffs

936
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:26,327
have already called me
about the settlement.

937
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,595
It's just a matter of time

938
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:29,062
before the rest of them
see the light.

939
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,597
I win.

940
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,065
I don't know
the last time you checked,

941
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,567
but as of this morning

942
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:35,735
all 200 of my plaintiffs
are staying with me.

943
00:36:35,803 --> 00:36:37,436
Bullsh...

944
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,805
I got them an advance
against their settlement.

945
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:40,306
No finance company
in their right mind

946
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:42,441
will back your suit.

947
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,244
I don't know if they
taught you math at Yale,

948
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,812
but that's 5 million.

949
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:48,214
$25,000 a plaintiff.

950
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,817
Exactly what you tried
to buy them off for.

951
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:53,653
You know what this means?

952
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:55,956
I'm gonna hammer them all
one by one,

953
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:58,325
break them down,
and it's gonna get ugly.

954
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:00,595
No, you're not.

955
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:02,664
What the hell is that?

956
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:05,834
It's a conversation between
you and Emerson Petroleum

957
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:09,071
discussing how you sent a man
to intimidate Kenny Verdasco.

958
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,873
Take a listen.

959
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:12,842
Don't worry,
it's not gonna give you cancer.

960
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,712
No matter what that is,
it's not admissible.

961
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,581
Unless of course you had
a warrant, which you didn't.

962
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,885
Showed up on my doorstep.

963
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:24,787
And I declared that
in this affidavit

964
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:28,457
which I'm about
to send to court.

965
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:29,926
Hmm.

966
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:32,162
So you're gonna
perjure yourself

967
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,730
just to win this case?

968
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,233
No, I'm not gonna
perjure myself.

969
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,401
Even if I were, it wouldn't be
just to win this case.

970
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,837
It'd be to get your ass
thrown in jail.

971
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,973
See, you have
power of attorney,

972
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,475
and you're gonna accept
this settlement,

973
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,210
$2 million a plaintiff.

974
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:47,678
You're gonna take it.

975
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,480
And you and that
shit eating grin

976
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:50,914
are gonna fly back to Boston

977
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,382
and never come back
to my town again.

978
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:04,761
You can use mine.

979
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:24,816
Told you I'd get his autograph.

980
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:27,419
I can't believe you.

981
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,988
You were gonna perjure
yourself just to win.

982
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:30,857
I thought you didn't
cross lines,

983
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:32,859
that that's the difference
between guys like you and him.

984
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:35,895
I had no intention
of submitting this affidavit.

985
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:37,664
I'm not gonna perjure myself,

986
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,933
but Tanner doesn't know that,
and he never will.

987
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,802
How do you know?

988
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,403
Because a man who's willing
to break the rules

989
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,838
can't imagine
someone else wouldn't.

990
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,073
You said that
you took my advice

991
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,975
and that you
surprised yourself.

992
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:49,476
I did.

993
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,045
That loan I got
for the plaintiffs,

994
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:54,014
I put up a million dollars
of my own money to get it.

995
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,851
If that's not having emotion,
I don't know what is.

996
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,987
- Get out.
- That seemed a little angry.

997
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,923
Feeling good? Satisfied? Happy?

998
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,224
All right.

999
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,627
Emotional.

1000
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,702
Okay, maybe a little happy.

1001
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,975
$2 million?

1002
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:23,977
Didn't I tell you
he was my right hand?

1003
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:26,412
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

1004
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,681
Tell me what it's like when you
deliver this news to everyone.

1005
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:31,150
Thank you.

1006
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,555
Told you I'd win.

1007
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,958
And it's a good thing too.

1008
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:41,927
Because if you hadn't, oh...

1009
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:44,663
What, oh?

1010
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:46,999
There's no way we're gonna
cover that million dollars.

1011
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:49,435
- None of it?
- Nope.

1012
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,303
Hey, how's your shoulder?

1013
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:53,706
Amazing.

1014
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:06,652
You called me?

1015
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,255
Sure did.

1016
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,291
Have a seat.

1017
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,594
I prefer to stand.

1018
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,630
Fair enough.

1019
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:21,401
Uh, I made a mistake.

1020
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,603
You were unfairly punished,

1021
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,371
and I would like to officially

1022
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,473
just welcome you back.

1023
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,942
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1024
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,479
Are you kidding me?

1025
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:34,781
You think I'm gonna make it
that easy on you?

1026
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,586
I want a raise.

1027
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,522
- 3%.
- 10%.

1028
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,959
- 7%.
- 10%.

1029
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,727
Fine.

1030
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:49,095
And Pearson-Hardman
pays for law school

1031
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,730
when I decide to go.

1032
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,099
Agreed.

1033
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,735
And one more thing.

1034
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,937
This shoulda been the first
words out of your mouth

1035
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:00,172
when I walked in here.

1036
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,043
You need to apologize to me
right now

1037
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,811
or I'm gonna file a lawsuit

1038
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,379
against you
first thing in the morning.

1039
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:10,382
You're right.

1040
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,417
I should have apologized.

1041
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:16,587
But don't you threaten me.

1042
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:18,822
I followed procedure
to the letter,

1043
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,891
and you have no basis
for a lawsuit.

1044
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,427
No, I don't.

1045
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,428
Not about this.

1046
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,498
But if you don't think
I have a basis

1047
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:31,002
for all the shit you've pulled
over the years I've been here,

1048
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,637
think again.

1049
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:38,109
I'm sorry.

1050
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,544
Okay?

1051
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,492
How'd it go?

1052
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:53,726
I don't know if you
had plans tonight,

1053
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:54,994
but you're gonna cancel
and help me put

1054
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,496
my office back together.

1055
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:58,030
Sure thing.

1056
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,465
So long as you don't quit
halfway through.

1057
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:02,401
Thank you, Mike.

1058
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:05,804
Yeah, sure thing.
