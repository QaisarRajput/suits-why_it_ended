164
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,879
Louis, I got your note,

165
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,680
And I know that norma's
still out,

166
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,249
But I really
don't have time to...

167
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,618
Norma's dead.

168
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,786
What?

169
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,721
She died this morning
taking care of her sister.

170
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,891
Oh, louis, I'm so sorry.

171
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,058
You don't need to fake it,
donna.

172
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
I'm not faking it.

173
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,194
She was a sweet woman.

174
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,129
She was a frickin' battle-ax
is what she was.

175
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,331
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't want to rip out

176
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,367
One of her varicose veins
and strangle her with it.

177
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,768
Okay, I don't think
you're in touch

178
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,437
With how you're really feeling
right now.

179
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,439
How I'm feeling
is that she left me high and dry

180
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,606
Just like she always did.

181
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,408
You expect her to keep working?

182
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,010
Look at this.

183
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,745
It's her entire estate
laid out on paper.

184
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,079
She couldn't manage my calendar,

185
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,282
But this crap fest she plans
within an inch of her life.

186
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,283
And you want me to make sure

187
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,517
These things
are bequeathed properly?

188
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,920
You can stuff them in
a giant piñata for all I care.

189
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,154
I have to go find
the perfect urn

190
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,722
To throw her ashes
off the top of the building.

191
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,757
She requested that?

192
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,425
No, she wanted them
to be in here with me,

193
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,793
But like hell I'm gonna do that.

194
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,862
Okay, louis, I will
take care of this for you,

195
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,031
But you're not throwing
her ashes anywhere without me.

196
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,332
Okay, fine.

197
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,834
Do you want me to smooth things
over with harvey for you?

198
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,702
No.

199
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,505
Harvey will be just fine
on his own.

200
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,311
I know who you are,
and I'm not interested.

201
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,613
Just 'cause I got
a bad reputation?

202
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,048
Because I'm not accepting
a drink

203
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,649
For putting your rival
behind bars.

204
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,151
You got the wrong idea, pal.

205
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,854
I didn't buy you that
for putting my enemy away.

206
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:12,123
I bought you that
for<i> how</i> you put my enemy away.

207
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,692
Okay, you got me.

208
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,461
[chuckles]
what are you talking about?

209
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,463
You.

210
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,998
You've got something special.

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
And I want people
with something special

212
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,068
Working for me.

213
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,135
Why exactly would I want
to work for you?

214
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,704
I can think of
a million reasons,

215
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,839
'cause that's the signing bonus
I'm gonna give you,

216
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,040
And that's a hell of
a lot more money

217
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,408
Than you're ever gonna make
as a lawyer.

218
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,410
And what if I told you

219
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,811
I don't practice law
to make money?

220
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,014
Then I'd ask you,
what do you practice it for?

221
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,083
To bend people to my will.

222
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,520
Then bend people to your will
for me

223
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,922
And make a lot of money
on top of it.

224
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,591
Well, here's the thing,
mr. Forstman.

225
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,993
Not that
it's any of your business,

226
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,162
But I'll be making 1/2 million
a year in no time.

227
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,931
1/2 million a year is dick.

228
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,966
My gardener makes that.

229
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,434
Then go offer your gardener
a job,

230
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,169
Because I'm not interested.

231
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,873
Just so you know, if you change
your mind and come back to me,

232
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,409
It's not gonna be
the same conversation.

233
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,812
Thanks for the drink.
Good luck, mr. Forstman.

234
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,752
Okay.

235
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,719
What are you doing?

236
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,221
What do you think I'm doing?

237
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,490
If forstman gave the money
to someone woodall's close to,

238
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,792
We need to start
by compiling a family tree.

239
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,528
I meant why aren't you
at school today?

240
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,165
Because I'm gonna prove
to harvey that I exist.

241
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay.

242
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,135
Now that you mention it,
what was that last night?

243
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,503
Ever since you came back,

244
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,838
It's like you and harvey
speak this secret language,

245
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
And I'm not a part of it.

246
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,374
Rachel, come on.
We have history.

247
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,677
I'm not talking about history.
I'm talking about respect.

248
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,011
Okay, you don't know
what you're talking about

249
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,346
If you think
harvey doesn't respect you.

250
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,480
Are you gonna tell me
that last night

251
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,715
He didn't give you a look
that said,

252
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,317
"you don't need to tell her
the full story

253
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,718
Because she doesn't need
to know"?

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,086
Rachel, he didn't give me
that look

255
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,321
Because he doesn't respect you.

256
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:53,124
He gave me that look
because he's ashamed.

257
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,593
What are you talking about?

258
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,395
[sighs]

259
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,930
Let's just say that
I'm not the only one

260
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,231
That charles forstman duped.

261
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,701
- Harvey got taken by forstman?
- Yes.

262
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,102
And he only told me
because he had to

263
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,104
When we were in the middle
of that takeover battle.

264
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,774
That's why harvey's so slow
to care about anybody.

265
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,677
Forstman used somebody
he cared about.

266
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,879
Holy shit.
I never even thought about that.

267
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,081
Who do you think it was?

268
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,284
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good guess.

269
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,720
Well, what do you think?

270
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,855
I think this place is a dump,
and I'm busy,

271
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,191
So why don't you tell me
why we're here?

272
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,525
I want to open
a restaurant here.

273
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,427
Marcus, there's already
a restaurant here.

274
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,996
And it isn't working.

275
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,665
Which is why they're gonna
lose their lease.

276
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,133
Take a look.

277
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,302
I've got a chef.

278
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,737
I've got a liquor license.

279
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,271
I've got renovation plans.

280
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,041
I have everything I need.

281
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,276
Except the money.

282
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,678
I need $150,000.

283
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,346
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, harvey.

284
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,648
This is my dream.

285
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,982
I know I can make this work.

286
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,083
And I'm not saying you can't,

287
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,118
But I don't have
that kind of money.

288
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,220
What are you talking about?

289
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,622
You're the big-time lawyer who
just got his name in the paper.

290
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,392
My name in the paper
doesn't pay me extra money.

291
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,427
I make $50,000 a year.

292
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,362
And you said you were gonna be
a corporate lawyer.

293
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,464
Yeah, and when I am,
I can help you, but right now...

294
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,867
I don't give a shit
about right now.

295
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,669
I give a shit about when
you were supposed to be

296
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,003
My big brother, but instead,
what did you do?

297
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,138
I know what I did.

298
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,806
Then you know
I can never get a loan

299
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,241
For as long as I live.

300
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,542
Marcus, when are you gonna
take responsibility

301
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,777
For your own shit?

302
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,779
What the hell does it look like
I'm trying to do?

303
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,654
I came to you first because
I know you'd want me to,

304
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,424
But if you don't come through,

305
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,925
I'm gonna go to mom.

306
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,226
You don't mean mom.

307
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,628
You mean him.

308
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,563
And you're not taking
a nickel from that man.

309
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,198
Taking his money
isn't gonna make

310
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,833
What he did to dad any worse.

311
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,668
That's bullshit,
and you know it,

312
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,770
And I'm not gonna let you do it.

313
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,472
Hey, harvey.

314
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,574
How the hell
are you gonna stop me?

315
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,882
(harvey) am I crazy,

316
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,484
Or is that the same dress
you were wearing

317
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,186
The last time I saw you?

318
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,253
You must be crazy,

319

Because I don't wear
the same dress ever.

320
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,691
Then you must spend a fortune
on wardrobe.

321

But I have to say,
it's worth it.

322

this isn't just a drop-by.

Harvey, we have a deal.

325

I put myself on the line
for you,

326
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,572
And our deal
is not going to change.

327
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,240
I could just pay you
the money back and move on.

328
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,309

you wouldn't be here

How much money
did marcus lose this time?

331
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,014

He wants to start a restaurant.

332

he has a problem,

And he's looking
to get money from you.

from me.

344

a bad reputation?

It's all gonna come
tumbling down.

find the money,

to cut a deal.

Why, because of his brother?

Yes, because of his brother,
or because he's ashamed.

it's a possibility.

He doesn't need me
to tell him about it.

more than ever.

- Oh.

That I have been wondering
for the last ten hours

Yeah, you did.

Mm-hmm.

474
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,065
And you think
this is his way out?

475
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,067
I know it is.

476
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,969
Hmm.

477
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,737
We're not a good fit,

478
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,539
'cause restaurants fail,

479
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,209
And when this one does,
you'll leave.

480
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:35,780
So you might as well leave
right now.

481
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,948
Then how about we bet on it?

482
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,449
You're gonna gamble on something

483
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,585
To get your brother
out of a gambling problem?

484
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,621
- I didn't say I had a problem.
- I think maybe you do.

485
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,591
When you always win,
it's not a problem.

486
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,860
[chuckling]

487
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,330
I think I might like you, pal.

488
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,472
Louis.

489
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,907
I got your message.
What's going on?

490
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,542
What's going on is,
they're trying to screw me,

491
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,543
And I need you to be bad cop.

492
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,545
What?

493
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,045
(man)
have you made a decision, sir?

494
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,249
No, I haven't made a decision,
you shyster dealer of death.

495
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,451
Okay, I think maybe
we're gonna need another minute.

496
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,752
No, we don't.

497
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,053
I don't need another minute
to see

498
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,722
That this looks like a pot
from home depot,

499
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,124
This looks like a lamp
from motel 6,

500
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,592
And this looks like
a goddamn howitzer shell.

501
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,461
You are lucky that I don't take
this mockery

502
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,930
Of a final resting place
and shove it up your ass.

503
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,865
- Louis, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough.

504
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,867
I've been handling this bullshit
for two days

505
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,236
For a woman who's supposed to be
handling things for me.

506
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,471
Louis, this isn't about the urn.

507
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,406
Oh, please don't give me
that touchy-feely shit.

508
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,641
And why the hell
are you not being bad cop?

509
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,042
Because that's not
what's needed.

510
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,644
Oh, bullshit
it's not what's needed.

511
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,145
- Louis.
- You don't care about me.

512
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,713
You never cared about me.

513
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,183
All you care about
is yourself...

514
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,119
And your stupid sister
and your hummel figurines

515
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,787
And your<i> murder, she wrote</i>
reruns.

516
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,489
Louis, I'm not norma.

517
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,826
She's gone...

518
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:56,994
And it's gonna be okay.

519
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,996
She was a battle-ax!

520
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:09,173
[crying]
but she was my battle-ax.

521
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,876
I know. I know.

522
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,878
Oh, she didn't just leave me
high and dry.

523
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,479
She left me for good.

524
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,281
I'm so sorry.

525
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,483
It's okay.

526
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,554
- [clears throat]
- both of you?

527
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,755
We both work for you.

528
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,157
Which is why we're both here
to say

529
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,460
Maybe it's time
we explore other options.

530
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,462
You got to be kidding me.

531
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,495
You spent two days on this,

532
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,030
And you're ready
to throw in the towel?

533
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,498
We've spent two
of our five days on it,

534
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
And we still don't have a name,

535
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,835
So we think
it's time to consider...

536
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,837
What?

537
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,838
Going after forstman

538
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,406
For whatever he did to you
12 years ago.

539
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,910
- You told her?
- Yes, I did.

540
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,912
Because like I said,
we both work for you.

541
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,313
Which means
we both want to help.

542
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,382
You think I haven't wondered
how to go after forstman

543
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,717
100 times
in the last dozen years?

544
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,851
Then why don't you?

545
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,286
Because I'm not the only one
at risk.

546
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,022
(mike) you mean your brother.

547
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,257
Yes, I do.

548
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,725
And I'm not gonna bring him
into this,

549
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,293
Because he didn't do
anything wrong.

550
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,861
Harvey, I'm not saying...

551
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,963
Did you hear me?

552
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,632
He doesn't just have a gun
to my head, okay?

553
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,733
He's got one to my brother's.

554
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,067
And how many times
have you told me

555
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,636
That when someone has
a gun to your head,

556
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,637
You figure a different way out?

557
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,438
This is charles forstman.

558
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,274
- There is no other way out.
- Harvey, there's...

559
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,542
I gave you a job to do.
Now do your goddamn job.

560
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,189
Well, that was a bust.

561
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,291
- We had to try.
- Did we?

562
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,525
I told you he'd be pissed off,
and he was.

563
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,060
Yeah, and you also told me
he needed to hear things

564
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,061
That he didn't want to hear.

565
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,462
Okay, well, now all he heard is,

566
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,464
Not only can't he trust me,
he can't trust you either.

567
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,066
That's not what he heard,
and you know it.

568
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,968
What he heard was that
you're the closest person

569
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,002
In the world to me,

570
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,470
I am never gonna
keep things from you,

571
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,172
And I'm not the only one
in his corner.

572
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,274
I'm the closest person
in the world to you.

573
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,309
Of course you are.
How can you even...

574
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,443
I'm not questioning it.

575
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,179
I'm the closest person
in the world to you,

576
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,349
And I wouldn't be
on your family tree.

577
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,350
You're talking about woodall.

578
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,718
Yes, I'm talking about woodall.

579
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,553
Woodall's married.
We checked his wife. Nothing.

580
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,088
That's the thing.
We're not married.

581
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,589
Okay, I really don't think this
is the time to bring that up.

582
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,957
I'm being serious.

583
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,492
We've exhausted every person
that's related to him.

584
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,195
Maybe it's time
we found someone who isn't.

585
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,966
- That's genius.
- Thank you.

586
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,503
Now I really don't understand
why harvey doesn't respect you.

587
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,538
It's too soon.

588
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,474
It's too soon for that joke.

589
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,975
Too soon.

590
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:28,145
[power tool whirring]

591
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,015
I can have any one?

592
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,550
Take your pick.

593
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,452
It doesn't matter,
'cause you're gonna lose.

594
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,553
That's funny.

595
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,355
I look at it like
I'm gonna win twice.

596
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,558
I get to drive a badass car,
and I get to kick your ass.

597
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,460
Cocky. I like that.

598
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,261
A guy like you,
I'm surprised you could stand

599
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,497
Working for cameron dennis
in the first place.

600
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,332
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't like cocky.

601
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,634
Take, for instance,
what's-his-name... dupont?

602
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,269
What's he up for?
Tax evasion?

603
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,738
- Insider trading.
- Yeah, whatever.

604
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,674
The point is, after
what you did the other day,

605
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,075
Why aren't you leading that?

606
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,377
Because this is cameron's case.

607
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,146
If I were him, it'd be yours.

608
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,882
Harvey, you are his star player,

609
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,184
And he's not even putting you
in the game.

610
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,186
And on top of that,
he didn't have the balls

611
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,689
To announce whether
he's going after dupont or not.

612
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,224
Don't you worry
about cameron dennis.

613
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:17,595
Dupont's gonna get
what's coming to him.

614
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,430
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

615
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,932
What are you talking about?

616
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,100
Well, you're loyal to the guy
you work for.

617
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,169
I like that.

618
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,704
So you were just
talking shit about him

619
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:27,805
To see if I'd jump on board?

620
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,641
And you didn't...

621
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,577
Which is why
we don't have to race anymore.

622
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,645
You're saying I got the job?

623
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,848
I'm saying welcome to the team.

624
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,717
Well, that's all
well and good, charles,

625
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,485
But we're still racing.

626
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,720
We sure as hell are.

627
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,889
We just have to find
something else to bet on.

628
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,125
Hey, sean.
Good to see you.

629
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,427
Don't give me that shit.

630
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,495
Did you confront eric woodall
yesterday morning

631
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,497
At his supermarket?

632
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,098
I ran into him by accident.

633
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,499
I like the produce there.

634
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,067
I'm not in the mood, harvey.

635
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,904
Did you approach the subject
of an sec investigation

636
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,673
With the express purpose
of intimidating him?

637
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,775
I approached him
with the express purpose

638
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,010
Of hiring me as his lawyer.

639
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,178
Why the hell would you do that?

640
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,512
You're supposed to be
helping me.

641
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,281
And if he's willing to
admit what he did,

642
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,283
That is helping you.

643
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,583
And instead, he's claiming that

644
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,418
I sent you there
to intimidate him.

645
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,086
Then I guess
that's the way it's breaking.

646
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,488
What the hell
are you talking about?

647
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,023
He's either gonna buy
what I'm selling

648
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,357
Or cover his tracks.

649
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,360
And if he covers his tracks,
you need to be there.

650
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,929
Are you asking me to follow him?

651
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,697
No, I'm telling you
to follow him.

652
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,599
I can't do that.
I don't have authorization.

653
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,267
Didn't stop you following me.

654
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,169
Enough.

655
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,139
He's filing charges
of harassment against me.

656
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,740
We do this, nothing sticks.

657
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,076
Then we might not get him,
because I have nothing.

658
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,978
Well, let me give you
a little extra motivation.

659
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,746
Remember,
woodall knows all about

660
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,882
Louis litt's
little forstman transgression.

661
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,284
So if he gets exonerated,

662
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,488
Who do you think's gonna be
the first person he goes after?

663
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,623
So, instead of going to jersey
for your produce,

664
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,291
Go get me something I can use.

665
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,373
You're having a drink
by yourself?

666
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,609
What's going on?

667
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,077
What's going on is,

668
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,315
I just finished having them
scrape jeff's name off his door.

669
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,351
So why don't you tell me
why you're here, harvey?

670
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,186
Cahill's having trouble
getting evidence

671
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,420
Against forstman and woodall.

672
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,722
I'm aware of that.

673
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,024
Then you should also be aware
that if woodall keeps his job,

674
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,392
He's likely to go after louis.

675
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,828
I could've done that math,
and so could you, so...

676
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,865
I might be able to
help them get forstman...

677
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,334
On something else.

678
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,869
Does this have something to do

679
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,305
With when he offered you
that job 12 years ago?

680
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,741
Yes.

681
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,910
[scoffs]

682
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,211
I told you that man was trouble.

683
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,747
And I told you
I wouldn't abandon marcus

684
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,149
And you were wrong about him.

685
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,851
So this has something to do
with marcus.

686
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:57,521
Yes, it does.

687
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,491
Well, if you are asking me
to choose

688
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,127
Between your brother and louis,
you know who I'm choosing.

689
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,795
I'm not asking you to do that.

690
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:05,829
Then what are you asking?

691
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,667
I want your help
to get my mind right.

692
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,671
Here's the thing, harvey.

693
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,507
Jeff's gone,

694
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,510
And he's gone
because of the choices I made.

695
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,848
So I'm not sure if I can
help you get your mind right,

696
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,151
'cause right now...

697
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,353
Mine's not right.

698
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,028
Hang on a sec.

699
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,030
Hey.

700
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,432
Hey.

701
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,934
You didn't come down here
just to give me my start date.

702
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,235
I came down here to tell you

703
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,704
I think
you have something special,

704
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,772
And I'd love nothing more
than to have you on my desk,

705
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,176
But I'm leaving the da's office.

706
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,244
Does this have something to do
with that forstman guy

707
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,646
Buying you a drink
the other night?

708
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,348
I thought you didn't know
who he was.

709
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,515
[scoffs] well, I looked him up

710
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,151
Because I thought
I was gonna be working for you.

711
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,487
And I'm telling you, he's shady.

712
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,855
Because he's got
a bad reputation?

713
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:08,125
I don't care
what his reputation is.

714
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,462
You don't know this about me
yet, but I know people...

715
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,197
Usually better
than they know themselves.

716
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,300
And the same way
I know you are a good person,

717
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,535
I can tell you that man
is rotten to the core.

718
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,937
You're just trying
to get me to stay

719
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:20,938
So you can work at my desk.

720
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,972
[chuckles]

721
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,841
Listen to me.

722
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,844
I don't care whether
I work on your desk or not.

723
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,979
You're making a mistake
if you take a job with that man.

724
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,347
Then I guess
I'm making a mistake,

725
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,349
Because I already did.

726
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,152
It was nice knowing you, donna.

727
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,461
So you're keeping her here
after all.

728
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,965
[chuckles]

729
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,500
Yeah, I couldn't throw her
off the roof

730
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,567
After you got me to cry.

731
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,136
I'm glad.

732
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,504
Donna, I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

733
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,573
Oh, you're welcome, louis.

734
00:27:56,575 --> 00:28:00,377
The truth is, I needed this
more than you know.

735
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,146
Well, I get it.

736
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,213
You needed a distraction

737
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,616
After everything
you just went through.

738
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,218
Uh, yeah.
Something like that.

739
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,688
Truth is,

740
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,990
I could use a distraction
myself.

741
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,925
Well, there is one thing
that you still need to do.

742
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:19,096
You need to start thinking
about a new secretary.

743
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:22,599
Donna, I know
I've asked you this before,

744
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,868
But we're so much closer now
than we were then, and...

745
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,603
Louis, I work for harvey.

746
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,138
You know
I can't be your secretary.

747
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,443
But we have this bond...

748
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,211
You and I.

749
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,880
Shakespeare, the gun club.

750
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,049
We've always spoken the same
language, and you know it.

751
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,517
Louis, I can't.

752
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,119
I get it.

753
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,690
We're better as friends.

754
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,526
Hey.

755
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,563
How about I set up
a little farewell for norma

756
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,833
As my last official act
as your interim secretary?

757
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,337
Thank you, donna.

758
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,552
Are you sure
we've got the right address?

759
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,054
I'm positive.

760
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:18,122
(woman) I'll be right back.

761
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,456
Can I help you?

762
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,625
Uh, yes, is there
a mary ann mcgrath here?

763
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:22,893
Who can I say is asking?

764
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,261
We're with pearson specter litt.

765
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,463
We'd like to speak with her
in regards to an ongoing case.

766
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,998
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

767
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
You just said she was here.
I don't understand...

768
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,102
Mary ann has
advanced alzheimer's.

769
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,670
But she's 55.

770
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,673
It's early onset, and hers is
particularly aggressive.

771
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,741
I'm sorry.

772
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,876
Can I ask how long
she's been a patient?

773
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,344
We're not supposed to
disclose any...

774
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,447
Please.
It's really important.

775
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,349
She was moved her
about a year and a half ago.

776
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:46,351
And before that?

777
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,285
I don't really know,

778
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,888
But I don't think
she was getting the best care.

779
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,690
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

780
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:04,434
My mother's 55.

781
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,870
You know, and if she's only here
because forstman pays for it...

782
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:07,872
I know.

783
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,239
Harvey wants us to find

784
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,641
The person woodall's close to.

785
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,643
That's all we can do.

786
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,910
Well, "all we can do"

787
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,845
Is gonna send her back
to some horrible facility.

788
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,580
- We don't exactly know that.
- Yes, we do.

789
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:20,350
Rachel, it's terrible.

790
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,752
I don't like it
any more than you do,

791
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,987
But it's not up to us.

792
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,790
I know.

793
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,360
It just sucks.

794
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,263
(harvey) you goddamn liar.

795
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,265
Oh, don't be mad.

796
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,534
Yeah, conchita tells everybody
I'm not home.

797
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,102
You know what I'm talking about.

798
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,238
Dupont investments
dropped through the floor today,

799
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,506
And you sold short

800
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,275
Based on something
that I told you in confidence.

801
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,311
I don't recall you telling me
anything at all.

802
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,445
You son of a bitch.

803
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,180
You made over $100 million
on that trade.

804
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,748
Yeah, I did.

805
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,517
Welcome to the real world, pal.

806
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,153
My real world doesn't involve
befriending young attorneys

807
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,754
To get inside information.

808
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,157
Maybe you're not the right man
for me after all.

809
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,125
You think I still want
to work for you after this?

810
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,827
You wanted competition
and money.

811
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,730
You got the competition.

812
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:07,898
Here's your money.

813
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,033
You can shove that $1 million
up your ass,

814
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,236
Because I'm not only
not taking your job,

815
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,470
I'm gonna prosecute you.

816
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,606
Then you might as well
add your name to the indictment

817
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,774
Since you've already
shared in the profits.

818
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,243
What are you talking about?

819
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,744
Take a look at this check.

820
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,646
It's not $1 million.

821
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:25,449
It's 850,000.

822
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,285
Bet you can guess where
the other $150,000 went.

823
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,287
What did you do?

824
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:32,055
You know what I did.

825
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,924
Marcus had nothing to do
with this.

826
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,059
He wouldn't have had you said
yes right away.

827
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,094
But you didn't.

828
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,996
We're giving you the money back.

829
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,931
You're gonna break
his little heart.

830
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,866
He thinks that money
came from you.

831
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:46,270
And you snatch cash out
of an addicted gambler's hands,

832
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,838
Take away his dream,

833
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,673
Only one way that story ends.

834
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,643
So you can either
pout about it...

835
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,746
Or you can embrace it and
prove to everyone I was right

836
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,982
When I said I saw
something special in you.

837
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,985
Someday the shoe's gonna be
on the other foot, charles.

838
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,755
Words spoken by every loser
I've ever met.

839
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,924
See you around, pal.

840
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,434
It's woodall's first wife.

841
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,369
Her name's mary ann.
They grew up together.

842
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,505
They got married
when they were 21

843
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,040
And had it annulled
six months later.

844
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,042
And what's the money for?

845
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,010
- She has alzheimer's.
- Don't tell me.

846
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,412
He moved her
to a high-end facility

847
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,846
And pays
for round-the-clock care.

848
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,448
And the problem is,
we called the company

849
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,650
That handles the billing, and...

850
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,084
And everything's in cash
up front,

851
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,752
Probably paid five years
in advance.

852
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,889
And mary ann couldn't tell you
because she doesn't speak.

853
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:43,026
Which mean we don't have
any proof.

854
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,161
Where are you going?

855
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,064
I'm gonna go get us some proof.

856
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,131
You did this?

857
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,299
Mike and I both did.

858
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,767
Then why isn't he here?

859
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,069
You know why.

860
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,771
Because it was more you
than him.

861
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,853
You did a good job, rachel.

862
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,513
Shopping, renting videos.

863
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,049
You must be going stir-crazy.

864
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,851
That's all right.

865
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,654
My suspension
is about to expire.

866
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,189
(harvey)
yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

867
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,557
We found mary ann.

868
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,625
I'm told she's doing well
at the new facility...

869
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,627
You know,
the one forstman's paying for.

870
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,134
You son of a bitch.

871
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,136
I'm not here to exploit
your tragedy, eric.

872
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,504
I'm here to tell you it's over.

873
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,638
Well, if this were over,

874
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,941
You'd be with sean cahill
right now,

875
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,010
Which means you're still looking
for me to cut a deal.

876
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,911
I'm looking for you
to turn on forstman.

877
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,980
You accost me
for the second time

878
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:39,616
In three days
and throw mary ann's name around

879
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,551
Like a bargaining chip,

880
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,520
And you think
I'm gonna help you?

881
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,522
Drop dead.

882
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,926
Eric, please.

883
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,129
The reason I knew to look
for someone that you cared about

884
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,497
Was that forstman did
the same thing to me.

885
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,500
He finds your weakness
and presses down

886
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,769
Until you don't have
the will to stand up to him.

887
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,838
With you, it was an ex-wife
with alzheimer's.

888
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,741
With me...

889
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,811
It was a little brother
addicted to gambling.

890
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't care.

891
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,348
You don't have proof,

892
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,316
And you're not gonna get it
in the next 24 hours.

893
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,384
You're right. I don't.

894
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,319
But here's the thing.

895
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,322
Cahill may have a deadline,
but I don't,

896
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,924
And I don't care
how long it takes,

897
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,559
Because I'm gonna find
that proof

898
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,127
If you don't turn on forstman.

899
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,044
(louis)
a lot of you don't know this,

900
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:44,381
But the truth is, I hated norma.

901
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,184
I hated her clogs,

902
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,186
Her mustache,

903
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,955
Her stupid seasonal sweaters.

904
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,925
But the thing
I hated most about her

905
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,827
Was her favorite story

906
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,864
About how abe vigoda asked her
to marry him in 1975.

907
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,299
I mean, we get it.

908
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,800
You were hot.

909
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,001
You turned him down,

910
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,970
And it was the biggest regret
of your life.

911
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,372
And like everything
you ever said,

912
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,541
I couldn't stand it at the time.

913
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,011
But now that you're gone,

914
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,515
I understand what you meant.

915
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:22,619
Don't let the moment pass.

916
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,554
Don't let the people you love
walk by you

917
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,224
Without letting them know
how you feel about them,

918
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:30,560
Because life slips by,
and then it's over.

919
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,896
And I'm not gonna let
another minute pass me by

920
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,266
Without letting you know
how much you mean to me.

921
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,706
I love you, norma.

922
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,213
Thank you, louis.

923
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,115
That was a lovely ceremony.

924
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,100
That was beautiful, louis.

925
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,535
I couldn't have done it
without you.

926
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,803
- Oh, that's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

927
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:17,807
I couldn't even see how I felt
without you showing me.

928
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,909
And the truth is, donna,

929
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,979
You know me better
than I know myself.

930
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:27,951
Like I said, harvey has no idea

931

How lucky he is to have you.

I supposedly gave eric woodall?
