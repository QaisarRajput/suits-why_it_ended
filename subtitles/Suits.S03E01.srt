00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,426
- Merely a gesture.
- Ah.

324
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,710
Heck of a gesture.

325
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,662
How would you propose
to a woman?

326
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:26,880
A woman?

327
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,549
I think we both know that--
Yes, we do.

328
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,685
[Laughs]
Anyway...

329
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,520
It is shaping up
to be a lovely day.

330
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:34,938
Oh, I wish
I could say that same.

331
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,607
I assume you know
about the latest goings-on

332
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,008
with Hessington Oil.

333
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,027
I wouldn't be much
of a partner if I didn't.

334
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,230
Now they've decide to take on
Ava Hessington personally.

335
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,449
- Who is they?
- The U.S. government.

336
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,401
I've decided to let Harvey
handle it.

337
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,620
- Why?
- Why not?

338
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,854
It's not a good time.

339
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,906
He's still digesting
the merger.

340
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,791
- Meaning?
- He's acting out.

341
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,326
Well, he may be
acting out,

342
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:59,296
but I understand he just got
his client triple the money.

343
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,965
By taking a huge risk
he didn't have to.

344
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,834
This case,
he may have to.

345
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,036
So that's why Harvey.

346
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:09,256
And this case is more
important to me than just money.

347
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,508
And why is that?

348
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,061
Because it is.

349
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,547
What if I said no?

350
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,216
[Laughs]
I'm afraid that's not an option.

351
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,819
So I guess
that sign

352
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,022
really doesn't mean 50/50
after all.

353
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,691
I did say
it was merely a gesture.

354
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,827
Hmm.

355
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,863
You keep showing up
to surprise me,

356
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,564
people are gonna
get the wrong idea.

357
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,084
People are going to think
what they're going to think.

358
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,703
I'm here to bury the hatchet.
And what prompted that?

359
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:42,039
Darby found out what you did
with Deron Williams.

360
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,740
Don't tell me.
He was impressed.

361
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,575
He was pissed.

362
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:46,743
Thinks you're trying
to get fired.

363
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,628
And you told him
how smart he was.

364
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,964
I told him
you said it wasn't true

365
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,549
and that I believed you,

366
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,218
and then I fought to give you
a chance to prove it.

367
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,587
Ava Hessington.

368
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:58,588
I got you on it.

369
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,756
What does that matter
to me?

370
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:00,857
Harvey,

371
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,259
I know you and I
have had our problems,

372
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,312
but this is a chance
for us to move past it.

373
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,563
Let's take it.

374
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,482
You really do
wanna make up.

375
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,484
I never wanted to be at odds
in the first place.

376
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:14,237
Neither did I.

377
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,540
Are we good?

378
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,159
Don't you wanna tell me
I better win this goddamn case?

379
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:20,944
I didn't think
I had to.

380
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,556
Never stopped you
from saying it before.

381
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,499
Well, I'm learning
to let go.

382
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,835
Oh, Harvey,
there is one more thing.

383
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,589
You better win
this goddamn case.

384
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,977
I know
it's not my place,

385
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,997
but you really suck
at quitting.

386
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,148
I can explain.

387
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,585
No need.
It was just a suggestion.

388
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:02,919
Rachel, I tried to do it,
but--

389
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:06,322
But then Jessica
gave you this office to stay?

390
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:07,824
Actually,
she gave me this office

391
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,962
before I could even
bring it up.

392
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:13,046
Well, aren't you

393
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,297
just the luckiest person
in the world?

394
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:15,665
Rachel--

395
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:17,517
You came to me,
you were petrified

396
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,502
of being exposed,
and I gave you a way out.

397
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,973
And now, 12 hours later,
you're in a brand-new office

398
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,274
with a diploma on the wall
that, for all I know,

399
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,609
came from Kinko's.

400
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:27,811
What do you want me to do?
Everyone hangs one.

401
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:32,182
No, Mike,
everyone doesn't just hang one.

402
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,650
So that's
what this is really about.

403
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,685
You're damn right
it is.

404
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:39,573
I've been trying to earn one
for as long as I can remember.

405
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:42,125
And you have one and everything
that goes with it,

406
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,628
and you didn't do
a single thing to deserve it.

407
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:45,745
You have no idea
what I have or haven't done

408
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,330
to get where I am.

409
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:49,666
And that's
the whole problem.

410
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:52,135
I have no idea
who you are.

411
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:30,915
Harvey, I'm just in the middle
of a little afternoon crossword.

412
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,083
Are you a puzzler?

413
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,718
Don't you have work
to do?

414
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,285
My dear fellow,
if I have to do work,

415
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,254
then I'm not doing my job.

416
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:38,255
What can I do
for you?

417
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,640
Jessica told me

418
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,509
that you agreed to let me
be lead on Ava Hessington.

419
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:42,893
I wanted to thank you.

420
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:45,295
- You're welcome.
- There's just one problem.

421
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:48,065
You didn't agree to anything.
You demanded it.

422
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,934
And you let Jessica
play good cop

423
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,320
because you didn't wanna
undermine the chain of command.

424
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,271
That's quite
the conspiracy theory.

425
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,806
Well,
here's the good news.

426
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:57,808
My plate's a little full
right now.

427
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:00,611
And since you didn't want me
on this case in the first place,

428
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,479
why don't you let
somebody else handle it?

429
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:04,582
Good luck.
I hear it's a tough one.

430
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:07,484
What do you want?

431
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,253
I want out.

432
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,421
I win this,

433
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,790
you tear up my noncompete,
and you fire me.

434
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:15,159
You hate this merger
that much.

435
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,827
I had an agreement
with Jessica,

436
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:18,095
and I honored it.

437
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:20,831
Then she accused me
of trying to get fired.

438
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,350
Then she lied to me

439
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,968
by claiming
that she fought for me

440
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,302
to be on this case.

441
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,522
She really does wanna
make up with you, you know.

442
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,191
Funny way
of showing it.

443
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,642
Ironic.

444
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,728
Her belief that you wanted
to be fired

445
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,230
led you to wanting
to be fired.

446
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:39,150
Do we have
a deal or not?

447
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:43,537
[Inhales]
It appears we do.

448
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,330
Oh, hey.
Uh, go ahead.

449
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:55,499
No, that's all right.
You were here first.

450
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,867
Why are you being
so polite?

451
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,135
Come on, you have
one stupid copy.

452
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,587
You could've finished it
already.

453
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:02,089
[Sighs]
Louis, I--

454
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:05,226
A letter of resignation?

455
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,260
Why?

456
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,262
It's complicated.

457
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:11,816
Well, simplify it for me,
Mike.

458
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,352
Harvey.

459
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:16,687
He's the one
who hired me.

460
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,222
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

461
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,556
What are you talking about?
He just gave you a new office.

462
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,192
No, Jessica gave me
a new office.

463
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:26,063
If it was up to Harvey,
I wouldn't even have a cubicle.

464
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:28,866
What happened?

465
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:32,236
All that matters is that,
uh, I can't fix it.

466
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,090
You know, when we were
in the bullpen,

467
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:39,093
Harvey was like Superman.

468
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,045
And then, one day,

469
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:43,047
Hardman decided to just
knock him down a peg.

470
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,682
Gave him
this bullshit assignment,

471
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:46,550
undoable workload,
unwinnable case.

472
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,185
And I took it
as a chance

473
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,604
to break down his walls
and offer my help.

474
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:51,889
And I just thought,
this just might be

475
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,257
the chance
that we could become--

476
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:55,943
- Friends.
- Yeah.

477
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:59,480
And he looked at me--
how dare I?

478
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:00,981
I get it.
He's alone.

479
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,616
He always has been.
He always will be.

480
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,652
Always was.

481
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,371
Harvey is
not Superman anymore.

482
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:12,576
He's Batman.

483
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:14,462
And Batman needs Robin.

484
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,780
And I just need
to remind him of that.

485
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,415
What's the one thing
that Harvey values

486
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,583
over everything else?

487
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:20,718
- Winning.
- Yeah.

488
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,919
You help him win,

489
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,954
he'll remember
why he needs you.

490
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,056
I have to figure out
what cases he's working on.

491
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:27,558
The I.T. Department
has access to every computer

492
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,894
in the entire firm,
syncs up every night.

493
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:32,396
So all I have to do is get
access to Harvey's hard drive.

494
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,464
That place is a fortress.

495
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,686
Both: Benjamin.

496
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,321
[Clears throat]

497
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:41,856
It's you.

498
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,574
Aw, that's sweet.
You remember me.

499
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:44,808
Oh, yes.

500
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,810
I remember everyone
who's ever bamboozled me

501
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,645
into giving them
a top-of-the-line laptop.

502
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:50,147
Their names
are Michael Ross.

503
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:52,166
I didn't bamboozle you,
Benjamin.

504
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,650
I won it
fair and square.

505
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:56,170
And I've been tracking
every Internet move you've made

506
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:59,173
for the past ten months,
waiting for the slipup.

507
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:01,759
Bet you thought you had me
at teenybikini.com.

508
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,711
No.
No, no.

509
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:05,212
Because I cross-referenced that

510
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,998
with your workplace
harassment case, and I knew.

511
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,967
But don't think I'm not aware
that you went home for dinner

512
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,469
and used your personal computer
to go back there.

513
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,438
Okay,
that's not actionable,

514
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,524
but hacking
my personal computer is.

515
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:19,360
Good luck proving that.
Now, what do you want?

516
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,345
- I want access to a hard drive.
- No way.

517
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:22,696
Not only that,
I want you to give me

518
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:24,532
whatever I want
whenever I want it

519
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:25,699
for the rest
of your life.

520
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:27,067
And why would I
do that?

521
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:28,536
Oh, right.

522
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,022
Because I just recorded you
admitting to violating the law.

523
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:35,125
- The XJS-5000.
- Mm-hmm.

524
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:36,744
- You--you set me up.
- Yep.

525
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:38,796
You knew that I would
track your home computer.

526
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:40,297
And after
you've been convicted,

527
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:43,801
you'll be lucky to be hired
as a network administrator...

528
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,053
At a high school...

529
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:48,005
In Jersey.

530
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,090
How long are you gonna
keep at this?

531
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:52,142
Until I find out
what I just got myself into.

532
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,761
I mean, look at this stack
of papers.

533
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:56,764
It's 1/5 of the files
we have on Ava Hessington.

534
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,400
- You need a shortcut.
- Well, I'm not going to Mike.

535
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,852
I'm not talking
about him.

536
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,738
Ava Hessington
started in the London office.

537
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:08,325
It's too late.

538
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,078
No, it's not.

539
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,283
You gotta be
kidding me.

540
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:18,335
How did you get
through security?

541
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,454
Charm and this smile.

542
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:21,705
You bought a ticket,
didn't you?

543
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:23,540
Trinidad-Tobago.

544
00:23:23,592 --> 00:23:25,909
First-class?
You're not even going.

545
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:28,679
I prefer to not travel
in style.

546
00:23:28,746 --> 00:23:30,214
I'd prefer to be alone
right now.

547
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:32,683
Scottie,
I need your help.

548
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,184
I'm sorry,
I have a plane to catch.

549
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:35,686
A plane, by the way,
that you put me on.

550
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:38,105
After I saved your job,
which you accepted.

551
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:39,756
So now we're both working
for the same firm.

552
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,591
Oh, I guess now I'm just
one of the many partners

553
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:42,776
who gets to work with you

554
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:45,029
and yet wants nothing to do
with you.

555
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,981
Scottie.

556
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:49,766
Please!

557
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:51,568
You once helped me
without me asking.

558
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,488
Well, now I'm asking.

559
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:56,707
Then tell me something.

560
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,626
Something what?

561
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,661
Just...

562
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:05,416
Something.

563
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,885
I remember the first time
I ever saw you.

564
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,753
Con Law.

565
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:12,089
You threw me some line, and I
gave you shit about your hair.

566
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,974
No, it was two weeks
before that

567
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,559
outside Langdell.

568
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,794
You were wearing a blue dress.
The wind was blowing.

569
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:20,564
When I saw your face,
it stopped me dead in my tracks.

570
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,350
That's not enough.

571
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:25,069
Well, I'm not finished.

572
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:27,154
The next time I saw you
was Con Law.

573
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,573
You answered the first question
that Dyson asked,

574
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,693
and I knew that that face
that blew me away

575
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:35,195
was your second best asset.

576
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,498
Look, you mean
something to me.

577
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:39,416
You've always meant
something to me,

578
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:44,338
and you always will mean
something to me.

579
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,678
You are such a dick.

580
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,298
What do you need, Harvey?

581
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:55,966

[Clears throat]

584
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:01,338
Well, this is gonna
take a while.

585
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:05,309
So you're gonna
buy me a drink,

586
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,029
and I'm gonna take that ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

587
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,431
Okay, Norma,
it's been 24 hours.

588
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:19,438
If you can't get me Barbara lL.
Tottingham on the phone,

589
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:20,823
well, then guess what,
you don't get--

590
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:23,909
Oh.
It's you!

591
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,411
Well, you tell Norma if I don't
have a package of uni-balls

592
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:26,745
on my desk by noon,

593
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,614
she can kiss her trip
to Dollywood good-bye.

594
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:29,965
Now, why don't you
get the hell out of here,

595
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,085
so I can fix myself
a raspberry Bran bar in peace?

596
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:36,055
What are you looking at?

597
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,514
Looking for this?

598
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,850
It's the last one.

599
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,302
Not today.

600
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,304
You're Barbara L. Tottingham.

601
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:54,690
I hardly made it difficult
to figure out.

602
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,975
Barbara L. Tottingham.

603
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:00,979
B.L.T.
Which is a sandwich.

604
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,865
And what does one put
on a B.L.T.?

605
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:04,366
Mayonnaise,
invented by the French.

606
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:06,619
Which points directly
to another French sandwich.

607
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,120
Of course, the monte cristo,
as in the Count of Monte Cristo.

608
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:09,338
How did I not see that?

609
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:10,422
It was staring me
right in the face.

610
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,490
Indeed it was.

611
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,625
The count returned
from the dead,

612
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,043
as I am now returned

613
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:16,128
from the banishment
to which you sentenced me...

614
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:17,630
As quartermaster.

615
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,264
I would ask you
how you did it,

616
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,667
but I know you wouldn't tell me,
because I wouldn't tell you.

617
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:22,851
What I will tell you is

618
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:24,019
that during my time
in the wilderness--

619
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:26,472
- It was three days.
- And nights.

620
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,690
I endeavored to discover

621
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:30,025
what perquisites
you value most in this firm--

622
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,444
your beloved Bran bars.

623
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:33,612
You're never going
to have them.

624
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,030
I can buy them myself.

625
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,956
Even if you were willing
to buy them yourself--

626
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:38,784
which we both know
you aren't--

627
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:41,036
you'll never eat them
on Pearson Darby grounds.

628
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,037
You didn't.

629
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,740
I did.
They're banned.

630
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:49,495
Wait a second.

631
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:52,798
You're telling me that
Barbara L. Tottingham is Nigel?

632
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,166
No.
Stay with me.

633
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:57,636
B.L.T., mayonnaise,
monte cristo sandwich.

634
00:26:57,704 --> 00:26:58,921
Oh, my God,
I'm so hungry.

635
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:00,222
- Donna.
- What?

636
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:02,174
What do you want from me, Louis?
I'm busy.

637
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,710
So you can't have your pens
or your Bran bars, big deal.

638
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,095
Donna, listen.

639
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,479
When I was in ninth grade,

640
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:09,067
there was this wrestler
Randy Cusumano.

641
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,899
And one day after school
in the locker room,

642
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:12,735
he pinned me down, and he taped
my butt cheeks together.

643
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,520
Wait a second, is this the
story from <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

644
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,071
I'm not familiar
with that song.

645
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,774
Never mind.

646
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:20,109
Look, I swore
that I would get him back

647
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,561
no matter what it took.

648
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:24,663
What did it take?

649
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:25,864
Ah, you don't really
wanna know.

650
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,199
Thank you.

651
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,734
The point is
if I'm Nigel and Nigel's me,

652
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:31,453
he's not gonna stop
at Bran bars and pens.

653
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:34,123
I gotta take care of Nigel
once and for all.

654
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,377
You need to get rid of him
as quartermaster.

655
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:39,628
Miss Hessington,

656
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:41,714
first of all, I want you
to familiarize yourself

657
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:42,881
with this man.

658
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,550
U.S. attorney
Richard Jensen.

659
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,218
He's one of the best
there is,

660
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,553
and he's
who we'll be going up against.

661
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:49,021
Well, that's all
well and good, Mr. Specter,

662
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,639
but I have one question.

663
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,808
Why should I hire you?

664
00:27:52,892 --> 00:27:54,226
Because you trust
Edward Darby.

665
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:56,395
I'm afraid that only gets you
in the room.

666
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:58,430
This civil servant

667
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,115
seems to have
a personal vendetta against me,

668
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,483
and I don't even know why.

669
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:02,601
Well, I do.

670
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:03,935
He needs a head
on a platter.

671
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:05,320
Why mine?

672
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:07,539
You've been skirting
environmental laws for a decade.

673
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,625
He's got a chance to nail you,
and he's gonna take it.

674
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,110
This isn't
an environmental allegation.

675
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:14,279
No, it's a bribery charge,

676
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,498
it's got teeth,
and it's coming your way.

677
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,468
Don't sugarcoat it,
Mr. Specter.

678
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:21,386
Give it to me straight.
Okay, I will.

679
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:23,472
Because when he digs
a little deeper,

680
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:24,790
he's gonna find evidence

681
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,559
of the spill your company
covered up in 2008,

682
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:29,895
the whistle-blower
you bought off in 2010,

683
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:33,732
and the environmental impact
study you doctored in 2006.

684
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,851
So it's not gonna be hard
to convince a jury

685
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:38,270
that you're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

686
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:40,072
to get your pipeline.

687
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,574
And what are you going to do
to stop him?

688
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:46,478
Bury evidence,
contact witnesses,

689
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,997
or sleep with your rival
pitcher's girlfriend

690
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,200
the night
before the big game?

691
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:52,918
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

692
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,253
I got it.

693
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,872
I looked into you.
You looked into me.

694
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,423
I actually prefer it
that way.

695
00:28:58,491 --> 00:28:59,825
And why is that?

696
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,126
Because you know
what I'll do to win.

697
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:02,937
Saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

698
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,713
And I won't have
to explain to you

699
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,331
what I did to win
that pipeline.

700
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:07,633
You bribed them.

701
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:09,468
Guilty as charged.

702
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,019
And I don't care
what Richard Jensen says.

703
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:12,805
Every company with a pipeline
over there

704
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,439
did the same thing.

705
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:16,508
- Is that your defense?
- It's the truth.

706
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,193
It would be nice
if we only found oil

707
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:21,146
under Texas ranchers
or North Sea fishermen.

708
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,564
But in the real world,

709
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:26,151
we find it in nasty places
under nasty people.

710
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:28,237
And any executive worth a damn
does what's needed

711
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,655
or goes out of business.

712
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:33,041
- Good. We're done.
- Excuse me?

713
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:34,886
I just needed to know
what I was dealing with

714
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:36,328
before I make
my next move.

715
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,330
- And what is that?
- I'll let you know.

716
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:40,916
I haven't officially
hired you yet.

717
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,168
Yes, you have.

718
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:52,394
How long
you been waiting here?

719
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,263
Since I found out
what you need.

720
00:29:54,347 --> 00:29:56,148
What I need is for you
to leave me alone.

721
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:58,934
No, what you need is
information on Ava Hessington.

722
00:29:59,018 --> 00:30:01,570
In 2008, her company tried
to destroy evidence--

723
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:03,889
Of an oil spill?

724
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,858
Okay, well,
in 2010, they--

725
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,492
They bought off
a whistle-blower.

726
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,111
And if the next thing
you're gonna tell me

727
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:12,164
is about an environmental
impact study in 2006,

728
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,198
don't.

729
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:14,900
You think
you're not replaceable?

730
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,668
I got all that
from an associate

731
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,203
I picked at random.

732
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:20,122
I've been doing this
before I met you,

733
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,908
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

734
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,343
You had enough?
No.

735
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,678
No, you know what, I haven't,
because you haven't.

736
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,096
Excuse me?

737
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,431
You haven't said whatever
you have to say to rip me

738
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:30,682
to shreds enough so that
you can start to forgive me.

739
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,267
So go ahead.

740
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,468
Whatever it takes,
I can take it.

741
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:35,520
Go!

742
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:37,189
Harvey, I'm sorry,
all right?

743
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:38,473
But I need you
to listen to me now.

744
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,275
Listen to you?

745
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,027
You know when I would've
listened to you?

746
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:43,195
That night.

747
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:46,932
- Jessica threatened me.
- I don't care.

748
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:48,200
Anyone comes at you
with any threat at all,

749
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,618
you come to me.

750
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:51,069
I don't give a shit
if it's the Queen on England.

751
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,121
You come to me.
You tell me!

752
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,823
You tell me everything!

753
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,042
That's what
goddamn loyalty is.

754
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,281
[Sighs]

755
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,625
[Knocking on door]

756
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:14,843
Okay, you're right.

757
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,094
You don't know
who I am

758
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:17,625
or what I've done
to deserve anything.

759
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,765
So here's what's gonna happen.
I am gonna tell you.

760
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,350
I am gonna tell you
everything,

761
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:22,901
and when we're done,
either we're gonna be finished,

762
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:24,903
or we're gonna go back there
and we're gonna do exactly

763
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:27,239
what we should've done
the other night.

764
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:29,358
Okay.

765
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:35,671
Okay, one more time.
I'm gonna show you.

766
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,621
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

767
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:37,622
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

768
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:38,623
Okay.

769
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:40,425
So I was here.
Mmhmm.

770
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:42,344
Yeah? And I was running
down here.

771
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:44,646
And the cops,
they were back here.

772
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,516
So I am running--
let's see, where is it?

773
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,101
Oh, yeah,
it was down here.

774
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:51,069
And I run into here,

775
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:53,155
and then Donna,
she was right here.

776
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:56,024
- Okay.
- So she let me in...

777
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:57,993
Here.

778
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:00,745
And then Harvey,
he was right down--

779
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:01,780
No!
[Laughing]

780
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:02,981
What?

781
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,316
Harvey is not getting
anywhere near there.

782
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,252
Oh, no one is ever
getting anywhere near there.

783
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,587
Oh, you think
you're that good, do you?

784
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,956
It's one
of my many gifts.

785
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,767
Being that good
or thinking you're that good?

786
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,460
Do you want a replay?
'Cause I will go right now.

787
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:17,929
- Like you could.
- I could!

788
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,215
Soon... ish.

789
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,000
Do you have, like,
an energy drink or something?

790
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:24,102
- Oh.
- Come on! We were up all night.

791
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,503
You kept me up
all night.

792
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:28,506
<i>You</i> kept me up all night.

793
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,869
I can't tell you
how it feels

794
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,687
that you know.

795
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:44,689
Mm, well, who knew

796
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,459
that honesty
was the best policy?

797
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:50,579
Oh, wait.
Everyone knew that.

798
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:51,630
[Laughter]

799
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:53,031
[Murmurs indistinctly]

800
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,550
- [Laughing]
- What?

801
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:58,136
[Muffled chatter,
laughter]

802
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:05,177
Can I help you?

803
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,396
Louis Litt.

804
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,015
Oh, I know
who you are.

805
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:12,434
Freshly minted
senior partner,

806
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:14,736
expert in matters
of corporate finance,

807
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,222
and the man responsible
for the superb training

808
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:18,356
of the associates.

809
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:20,108
[Chuckles]

810
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:22,277
You've looked into me.
Mmhmm.

811
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:25,280
I've looked into you.

812
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:27,199
Tarte au chocolat
from Cafe Pouchkine.

813
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,567
The best patisserie
in Paris.

814
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:31,286
A steeping cup
of da Hong pao.

815
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,371
The most expensive tea
in the world.

816
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,373
Two of my favorite things.

817
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:39,044
What better to enjoy
after signing this order...

818
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:40,345
Making me quartermaster?

819
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,713
Pity you don't have
a Montblanc pen

820
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:42,964
for me to sign it with.

821
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,767
With cobalt ink.

822
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:47,385
We already have
a quartermaster.

823
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:48,853
Sir, I know...

824
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:50,972
That this is
Nigel's position

825
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:53,308
and him losing it
would not be easy for him.

826
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:55,110
But let me
just assure you,

827
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:58,113
I'm not just prepared
for this position...

828
00:33:58,197 --> 00:34:00,565
I was born for it.

829
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:03,568
I have PhDs
in chemical engineering

830
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,120
and petroleum exploration.

831
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:07,789
I've made it to the top
in a field dominated by men,

832
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:10,242
and I'm facing
a prison sentence

833
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,410
for an allegation
which any man in my position

834
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:13,778
would be fined for.

835
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:15,914
Every similar case
has been settled with a fine,

836
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:17,132
not prison.

837
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,337
That's what we're proposing.

838
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:20,418
Well, there's just
one problem.

839
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,887
I'm not charging you
because you're a woman.

840
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:24,472
I'm charging you
because you're the one I caught.

841
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:27,008
Ava, can you give us
a minute?

842
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:35,433
[Door closes]

843
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:37,936
Okay, she's gonna
write you a check.

844
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:39,271
Let's talk about how much.

845
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:41,489
I'm sorry, Harvey.

846
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:43,525
Not this time.

847
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:47,145
Is that what I said to you
on Hazelton?

848
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:48,863
That was
a long time ago.

849
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,116
We're not at the D.A.'s office
anymore.

850
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,985
I didn't realize our bond
had an expiration date.

851
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,820
It doesn't, but...

852
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:59,090
you want to deal on this,
I need jail time.

853
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,294
You're running for office?

854
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:03,762
What if I am?

855
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:06,431
You need a scalp.

856
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:07,932
I can think of four people
off the top of my head

857
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,480
that make her look like
Mother Teresa.

858
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:11,720
Harvey, I can't afford
to horse trade on this.

859
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:12,804
You've done it before.

860
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,806
And I'll do it again,
but... not today.

861
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:17,559
Richard, you are singling out
this woman, and it's wrong.

862
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:20,145
That's not my problem.

863
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:21,563
What if I told you
I need this one?

864
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:25,283
Then I'd have to tell you...
I'm sorry.

865
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,403
Not gonna forget this.

866
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:29,821
Harvey, look.

867
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:32,457
If our bond can't survive
me telling you no,

868
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:34,192
then...

869
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:37,162
It didn't mean much
to begin with.

870
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:48,506
- Hey, Rach.
- No time, code two!

871
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:49,891
Richard Gere's
in the lobby?

872
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,394
- Leaving now, let's go.
- Relax.

873
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:55,397
We have trained for this.
Okay.

874
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,881
[Laughter]

875
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:58,883
Wait!

876
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,066
Congratulations.

877
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:18,569
Your writing implements
and nourishment of choice.

878
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:19,754
Mm.

879
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,758
Yeah, I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

880
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:26,010
- Please don't do this.
- [Chuckling]

881
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,096
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

882
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,598
You're not gonna trick me into
letting you stay quartermaster

883
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:32,133
just so you can take away
what's most dear to me

884
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:34,602
little by little.

885
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:38,306
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take it away all at once.

886
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,192
What are you
talking about?

887
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,062
I took you for a bylaws man.
It seems I was wrong.

888
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:45,596
At Darby International,

889
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,148
one cannot be in charge
of both the animate

890
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:49,734
and the inanimate
at the same time.

891
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:55,156
Your beloved associates
are mine.

892
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,491
You set me up.

893
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:57,909
What better way
to catch a rat

894
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,661
than with
quartermaster cheese?

895
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:00,962
What are you gonna do,

896
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:04,082
beg Darby to undo
what you just begged him to do?

897
00:37:06,302 --> 00:37:08,887
Hold on.

898
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:12,257
Nigel, the associates
are my life.

899
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,626
So please don't do this.

900
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,679
When I was
at preparatory school,

901
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:20,432
like you,
I was bullied again and again.

902
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:23,268
It was painful,
but I always saw them coming.

903
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:24,802
But with you,
I didn't.

904
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:28,189
So it wasn't a stab in the back,
it was a stab in the heart.

905
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,942
And I just gave you
the opportunity to take it back,

906
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:32,577
and you passed.

907
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:36,865
So no, quartermaster Litt,
I won't forgive you.

908
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:44,155
Nice office.

909
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:45,924
Thanks.

910
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,209
Do you mind
if I ask you a favor?

911
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,377
Yeah, anything.

912
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,179
I have
a ton of old files

913
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,131
that I need organized
and shipped to storage,

914
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:56,334
and I was wondering if you
could maybe do that for me.

915
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:57,835
I

916
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,354
Because I figured if you were
suddenly doing things for people

917
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,306
that they don't need you to do,
didn't ask you to do,

918
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:04,976
and don't want you to do,
then maybe I'd get in on that.

919
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,949
I put that on Harvey's desk
for him, not you.

920
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:13,234
Maybe.

921
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,019
But I know
what you don't seem to get.

922
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,855
Harvey didn't value you
for your help on cases.

923
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:20,358
He valued you for your loyalty,
which he told you last night.

924
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:21,576
Yeah, I know that.

925
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,820
And I'm trying
to get it back,

926
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,028
and this is
the only way I know how.

927
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,363
By sending Rachel
to distract me

928
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:26,831
and sneaking
into his office?

929
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:28,500
Oh, by the way, you think
I don't know about you two?

930
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,201
Took me one look.
Donna, come on.

931
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:33,221
You wanna know how
to get Harvey's loyalty back?

932
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:35,723
Get in a time machine and undo
what you did with Jessica.

933
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,708
Oh, shoot,
you can't do that.

934
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,311
You know what, I figured
you'd bring this file back.

935
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,347
There's also one
in your bottom drawer.

936
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:46,017
You might wanna grab that too.

937
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,185
And just in case of that,

938
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:49,938
I put seven other copies
in his office.

939
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:51,489
'Cause whether
he forgives me or not,

940
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:54,025
he's still gonna need it.

941
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:56,361
Some random associate
gave him all that information

942
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:58,913
on Ava Hessington?

943
00:38:58,998 --> 00:38:59,948
No way.

944
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,500
It was Scottie.

945
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,735
Yeah, I found the ticket
to Trinidad-Tobago.

946
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:06,004
It's not a giant leap.

947
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:08,706
The only problem is
Scottie's not here.

948
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:10,124
She's in London.

949
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,743
And Harvey--
he is still gonna need this.

950
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:16,798
This file doesn't lead
to Harvey forgiving you.

951
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:18,299
Donna...

952
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:20,268
Please could you just separate
our relationship

953
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:22,153
from yours and his
for just, like, one second?

954
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:23,555
Are you kidding me?

955
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,223
Do you think I'm mad
just because of him?

956
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:27,191
You did this
to me too.

957
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:28,726
And whether you appreciate it
or not,

958
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:30,478
I've had your back
since the day that you got here.

959
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:33,064
Yes. Yes, you have.
But what about last year?

960
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,449
When I had your back,
you ignored me,

961
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:36,200
and it almost cost him
his license.

962
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:38,870
The difference is
I did what I did for him,

963
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,455
not for me.

964
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,607
And I didn't get
a brand-new office for it.

965
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:44,876
I got fired.

966
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,997
Yum.

967
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:58,200
Oh, what do you want, Michael?
Please.

968
00:39:58,251 --> 00:39:59,734
I'm just trying to eat
my egg McMuffin

969
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,036
while I'm still off-line,
okay?

970
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,755
I thought
you were never off-line.

971
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,791
Five minutes a day.

972
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:08,293
Listen, Benjamin,

973
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:11,046
I don't wanna hold what's
on this dictaphone over you

974
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:12,214
for the rest
of your life.

975
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:14,633
Why not?

976
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:16,218
I don't need
any more enemies.

977
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:18,553
I'd rather have a friend,
but...

978
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:20,522
I do need a favor.

979
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:22,224
And if I don't
give it to you,

980
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:26,228
then what do you do
with the dictaphone?

981
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:27,863
It's the only copy
there is.

982
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,064
Go on, erase it.

983
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:31,149
Then I'll ask you
my favor.

984
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:34,035
How do I know
that this is the only copy?

985
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:36,488
Because I'm giving you
my word.

986
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:41,660
[Beep]

987
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:42,827
What do you need?

988
00:40:42,912 --> 00:40:47,082
I need you to build me
a time machine.

989
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:50,502
And a bite
of the sandwich.

990
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:53,121
Come on.
That's not sanitary, Michael.

991
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:55,974
Come on,
just a little.

992
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,894
You can have
the rest.

993
00:41:00,846 --> 00:41:02,630
- How did it go with Richard?
- It didn't.

994
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:04,465
- He didn't budge.
- Why not?

995
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,801
Says he's running for office,
but it doesn't make sense.

996
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:09,604
Yeah, it does.

997
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,308
Son of bitch!

998
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,475
He looks me in the eye,

999
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:15,927
and he feeds me
a bullshit sandwich.

1000
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,979
He's obviously not
the same man he used to be.

1001
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,248
Yeah, well, I am.

1002
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:22,284
Wait a second.
Let me guess. Mike?

1003
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:23,535
Just because you use it

1004
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:24,652
doesn't mean you have
to forgive him.

1005
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:26,654
You're right.
I don't.

1006
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,998
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

1007
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,334
Hessington Oil's
number one competitor

1008
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:42,270
also happens to be your biggest
campaign contributor?

1009
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:43,555
Which has nothing to do
with the fact

1010
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,723
that your client
broke the law.

1011
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:46,007
You don't want a deal.

1012
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:48,109
What you want
is a long, drawn-out trial

1013
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:50,111
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

1014
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,314
You think I wasn't
gonna find that out?

1015
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,698
I mean,
I gotta hand it to you.

1016
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:54,849
You set it up perfectly

1017
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,117
to shield yourself
from prosecution.

1018
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:58,954
To shield myself
from breaking the law.

1019
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:01,373
Richard Jensen:
Prosecuting the competition.

1020
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:03,124
It's a hell
of a campaign slogan.

1021
00:42:03,192 --> 00:42:06,077
Harvey,
your client did this.

1022
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,029
I'm not going
after an innocent person.

1023
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,881
And you know
that if I win this election,

1024
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,416
I will do good things.

1025
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,635
You know what, you sound
just like Cameron Dennis.

1026
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:14,919
You remember?

1027
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:17,305
Always a reason,
always out for the greater good.

1028
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:19,591
But in the end,
it's all about him.

1029
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:21,760
Look, I've never claimed
to be out for the greater good.

1030
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:24,679
So cut me a deal
and find yourself another donor.

1031
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,849
Harvey, it's too late.

1032
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,485
Please.
I need this.

1033
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,440
Well, that's not
my problem.

1034
00:42:36,558 --> 00:42:39,411
Send Carolyn my love.

1035
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,249
You wanted to see me?

1036
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,118
I know why you care so much
about Ava Hessington.

1037
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:48,169
Well, it's no secret.

1038
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,838
Her father
was my first client.

1039
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:54,509
I think he was
a little bit more than that.

1040
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:56,077
It was a different time.

1041
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:58,463
Does she know?

1042
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,099
She knows
that I care about her.

1043
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:03,024
I'm sorry, was there
something else you wanted?

1044
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:04,269
Just to let you know
that if I could figure that out,

1045
00:43:04,353 --> 00:43:05,970
Harvey can figure that out.

1046
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:07,722
And why would that
be a problem?

1047
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:09,224
Because it's one thing
for Harvey to know

1048
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:10,725
that this case
is important to you,

1049
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:14,029
another to know
how important.

1050
00:43:14,096 --> 00:43:16,614
Are you telling me
you don't trust him?

1051
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,033
I told you

1052
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,269
he's having a difficult time
digesting this merger.

1053
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,907
I don't want him using this
as leverage to leave.

1054
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,709
At the end of the day,

1055
00:43:27,776 --> 00:43:31,046
I don't believe
Harvey really wants to leave.

1056
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:33,715
Harvey...

1057
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:34,999
What a coincidence.

1058
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:37,952
Cameron.
You grew the mustache back.

1059
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:39,838
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

1060
00:43:39,922 --> 00:43:42,640
It wasn't a success
the first time.

1061
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:44,125
What are you doing here?

1062
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:45,894
Ah, Richard told me
that you mentioned me

1063
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:47,395
at your last meeting.

1064
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:50,231
It's funny,
'cause he called me

1065
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:52,800
after your first meeting,
wanted my advice.

1066
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:54,602
So I guess
you're here to tell me

1067
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:56,271
he's not gonna give me
a deal.

1068
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:58,306
I'm here to tell you he's
recusing himself from the case.

1069
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:00,275
He didn't want the appearance
of a conflict

1070
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:02,360
to damage the workings
of justice.

1071
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:04,312
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

1072
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:07,148
Lucky for me,
I've always been special.

1073
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:08,833
No, you've always been
a corrupt prick.

1074
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:10,618
It just took me a while
to realize it.

1075
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:12,153
And it took me a while
to realize

1076
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:14,456
that you don't have a speck
of loyalty in your entire body.

1077
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:17,425
Loyalty is a two-way street,
and you ran me off the road.

1078
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,344
So what
are you gonna do?

1079
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:21,513
You gonna let Jessica fight your
fight like you did last time,

1080
00:44:21,597 --> 00:44:22,830
or you gonna run away

1081
00:44:22,882 --> 00:44:24,132
like you did when you left
the D.A.'s office?

1082
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,134
Neither one, Cameron.
But thank you.

1083
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:27,802
For what?

1084
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:30,838
For reminding me
that I don't run from a fight.

1085
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:34,809
What was so important
that I had

1086
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,728
to come down here
right away?

1087
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:39,948
Don't tell me
you want a bigger office.

1088
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:41,783
You told me
that I can think of this office

1089
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,235
as a reminder
of what I did to Harvey

1090
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,739
or as a symbol
of what I can do at this firm.

1091
00:44:47,823 --> 00:44:49,991
But the thing is
I don't wanna be here

1092
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,026
if I'm not solid
with Harvey.

1093
00:44:52,077 --> 00:44:54,529
Well,
that's between you and Harvey.

1094
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,500
It's between you and me.

1095
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:01,336
You put yourself between us
when you blackmailed me.

1096
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:03,254
Well, the word
you're looking for is extortion,

1097
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:04,756
not blackmail,

1098
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,258
and I'm not going to comment
on that accusation.

1099
00:45:07,343 --> 00:45:10,178
But as for your choices,

1100
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,213
you made those
all by yourself.

1101
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:13,515
So don't come crying
to me.

1102
00:45:13,566 --> 00:45:15,433
[Clears throat]

1103
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:18,052
This is a copy of the letter you
wrote to the district attorney

1104
00:45:18,103 --> 00:45:20,438
when you threatened
to expose me.

1105
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:22,524
Expose you?
For what?

1106
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:23,855
I never wrote
a letter like that.

1107
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:26,327
I'm not recording you.

1108
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:27,779
I don't need
to record you.

1109
00:45:27,863 --> 00:45:30,532
This letter was printed
from your hard drive,

1110
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,401
which has your computer's
digital signature.

1111
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:38,873
What do you want?

1112
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:40,375
I wanna know,
if you had the chance,

1113
00:45:40,426 --> 00:45:41,742
would you have traded
that car

1114
00:45:41,794 --> 00:45:43,211
to get your parents
back together?

1115
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:44,345
[Scoffs]

1116
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:45,847
That's a stupid
goddamn question,

1117
00:45:45,914 --> 00:45:47,131
and you know it.

1118
00:45:47,216 --> 00:45:49,684
I never had that chance,
so what does it matter?

1119
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,103
Because I do.

1120
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:55,723
What do I want?

1121
00:45:55,774 --> 00:45:57,976
I wanna give
this office back.

1122
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,562
I didn't earn it,
I don't want it,

1123
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:02,693
and if there's a chance
it'll help Harvey forgive me,

1124
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:04,699
I'm gonna take it.

1125
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:10,655
Oh, and, uh,

1126
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,875
if you ever do
send that letter,

1127
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:16,878
you're in the same boat
as me.

1128
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,292
Harvey,
you're looking determined.

1129
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:33,928
- I am.
- What can I do for you?

1130
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:36,981
Look, I know
we had an arrangement,

1131
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:38,316
but I came here
to change it.

1132
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,317
Change it?

1133
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:41,069
But you might not even win.

1134
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:43,738
I've just heard about
this new special prosecutor.

1135
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:45,940
Relax, the case
was always gonna be hard.

1136
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:47,242
It just got
a little harder.

1137
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,576
Because you made it
that way.

1138
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:49,911
That's my problem.

1139
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:52,113
And now you're using
that increased difficulty

1140
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:53,814
to renegotiate our deal.

1141
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:57,752
That's your problem.

1142
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:01,089
We both know
how important Ava is to you.

1143
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:03,875
What do you want?

1144
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:05,793
I don't wanna run
from a fight.

1145
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:07,428
Meaning?

1146
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,429
I win,

1147
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:10,965
you don't fire me,

1148
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:14,502
you back me
for managing partner.

1149
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:18,005
You want
to take down Jessica.

1150
00:47:18,057 --> 00:47:19,797
Yes, I do.

1151
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:24,798
