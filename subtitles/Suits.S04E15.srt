1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,103
Just wanted to tell you
that I appreciate you

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,337
Patching things up with him.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,008
I would do anything
for the woman that I love.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,542
They are gonna come at us
any way they can,

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,077
And when they do,

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,479
It's not gonna be
about heat sensors,

7
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,147
It's gonna be about you.

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,483
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

9
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,284
That knows
those sensors are faulty.

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,652
I'm sorry, what is it
you need again?

11
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,389
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

12
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,624
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

13
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,261
Have you heard of the national
transportation safety board?

14
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,531
(evan) that's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,402
Which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

16
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,571
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

17
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,075
Your whole story about how
louis got his name on the door

18
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,176
Is bullshit.

19
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,377
Jeff.

20
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,447
It's over, jessica.

21
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,449
We're done.

22
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,159
I can't believe you actually
got them to admit what they did.

23
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,161
You better believe it,
because it's happening,

24
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,564
And it wouldn't be
happening without you.

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,433
You mean without me
being greedy.

26
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,201
Joe, that's not
what I was gonna say.

27
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,203
No, no, no, I know that
you don't think I care

28
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,106
About these people, but I do.

29
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,474
But I'm also a working stiff.

30
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,277
I go paycheck to paycheck
for my whole life,

31
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,478
And then a thing like this...

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,413
Could turn your
whole life around.

33
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,185
Guy like you might not be
able to understand that.

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,188
I understand.

35
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,856
So it's a done deal?

36
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,558
Might take a few
days to finalize,

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,293
But yeah.

38
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,861
It's happening.

39
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,163
You have my word.

40
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,465
You're all right, mr. Ross.

41
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,806
Harvey, you know the only
times you've been here at night

42
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,341
Were the god-awful
dinner party...

43
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,343
And the other time.

44
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,810
Well, this isn't that.

45
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,312
I want to know why liberty rail

46
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,280
Has a video of you
in their file room.

47
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,515
What are you talking about?

48
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,283
I'm talking the fact
that our smoking gun

49
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,485
Just became inadmissible.

50
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,420
- Harvey...
- How'd you get those documents?

51
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,288
Are you asking
if I did something illegal?

52
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,456
Because I didn't.

53
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,524
Well, they went to the d.A.,

54
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,226
Which means they think you did,

55
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,861
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

56
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,596
How did you get
in their file room?

57
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,598
By walking through the
door they buzzed open.

58
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,133
And why would they do that?

59
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,267
Because I'm me.

60
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,169
What the hell does that mean?

61
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,204
It means that I led
the woman to believe

62
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,672
That I was an official
from washington.

63
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,307
Led them to believe it,

64
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,675
Or flat out told them?

65
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,511
Because one kills our case

66
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:29,848
And the other puts you
in a world of shit.

67
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,216
Harvey, I'm not an idiot,

68
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,885
And I don't appreciate
being treated like one.

69
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,287
I told you I didn't do
anything illegal, and I didn't.

70
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,555
Not an idiot?

71
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,657
What the hell were you doing
there in the first place?

72
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,425
- Harvey.
- It was mike's idea, wasn't it?

73
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,929
No, he didn't even
know about it.

74
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,664
- Where are you going?
- To see mike.

75
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
I told you, he didn't even
know I was going to do it.

76
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,402
I don't care, because he
sure as hell knew after.

77
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,603
Let's go.

78
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,238
[engine turns over]

79
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,617
I am so proud of you.

80
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,453
I've done that before.

81
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,557
I'm not talking about that.

82
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,225
I'm talking about your case.

83
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,393
Ah.

84
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,928
You believed in it,
and you fought for it,

85
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,298
And I...
I love that about you.

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,535
And I love that you
love that about me.

87
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,205
When a person gives you
a compliment like that,

88
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,207
You're supposed
to give one back.

89
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,508
But I just did.

90
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,443
I said that you love
that I love that about me.

91
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,413
About you?

92
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,614
How would that make you feel?

93
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,250
So tired.

94
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,453
Well, we both know
why you're so tired.

95
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,988
Yeah, because I'm so good.

96
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,623
Don't you love that about me?

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,495
[knocking on door]

98
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,600
You knew donna bullshitted
her way into that company

99
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,302
And you let us use
those work orders?

100
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,503
How did you find out?

101
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,938
It doesn't matter
how I found out.

102
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,340
Answer my question.

103
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,908
Yes, I knew, but what
difference does it make? We won.

104
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,376
We didn't win,

105
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,312
Because evan smith has video
of donna in their offices.

106
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,547
- What?
- She know about this too?

107
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,349
Harvey, she's just
trying to strong-arm us.

108
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,550
Are you listening to me?

109
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,385
They have the opposing
counsel's secretary

110
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,420
Poking around
in their goddamn file room.

111
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,489
If I were the d.A.,
I'd sure as hell look into it.

112
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,358
- The d.A.?
- Yeah, the d.A.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,659
Harvey, they let her in.

114
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,594
According to you,
but they're gonna claim fraud

115
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,463
Or theft
or any number of things.

116
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,031
What are you gonna do?

117
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,533
I'm making a deal to drop this
case, that's what I'm gonna do,

118
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,935
And you're gonna file
the paperwork as soon as I do.

119
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,436
So you're just gonna
let this woman

120
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,638
Blackmail you without a fight?

121
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,905
You're damn right I am.

122
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,508
There is no case,

123
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,377
And I wouldn't give a shit
about it if there was.

124
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,645
I care about donna.

125
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,647
And you think I don't?

126
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,680
You care so much for her?

127
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,948
Then draw up those papers,

128
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,417
Because I'm letting
evan know it's over.

We have a situation.

140
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,365
Is the fate of the firm
hanging in the balance?

141
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,667
- No...
- Then I don't give a shit.

142
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,036
You told malone, didn't you?

143
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,375
I didn't get a chance
to tell him,

144
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,876
Because he had already
figured out

145
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,878
That I had been lying to him
this whole time.

146
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,083
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry.

147
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,085
This morning I thought
I was going away with him

148
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,619
For two weeks.

149
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,987
Now I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see him again.

150
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,589
He quit?

151
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,092
He didn't get around
to giving me his career plans.

152
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,993
You want me to talk to him
for you?

153
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,996
No, this is my mess.

154
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,832
And I will take care
of it myself.

155
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,066
You can take care of it
tomorrow.

156
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,135
Right now,
I'm making you a drink.

00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,077
Zipadeedoodah or grab my sack?

158
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,679
- What?
- Messenger service.

159
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,713
Which one do we use?

160
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,881
- I-I...
- You know what?

161
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,616
Use whoever you want.
Just take care of it.

162
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,151
Louis, don't you have
your own secretary?

163
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,153
Oh, you mean norma,
who I can't find anywhere,

164
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,821
Who is probably taking
the day off again?

165
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,023
Last year, she tried to get
arbor day off,

166
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,626
And I told her to blow a goddamn
tree and get her ass in here.

167
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,727
You know what, louis?

168
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,597
Norma has taken 4 days off
in the last 36 years.

169
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,998
Why don't you back
the hell off of her.

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,733
What the hell is the matter
with you?

171
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,869
You usually jump on
the norma bashing train

172
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,937
Like a hobo in a 1940s
action movie.

173
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,039
- I'm sorry; I just...
- What?

174
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,611
I bullshitted my way
into liberty rail

175
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,745
To get some documents.

176
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,880
They caught me on video,

177
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,748
And now they're threatening
to press charges.

178
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,053
You're not saying anything.

179
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,089
It's nothing.
It's fine.

180
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,892
Then why did you look
so concerned?

181
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,161
I was concerned,
but they're threatening charges,

182
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,762
Which means they want something,

183
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,898
And I know harvey,
and whatever it is they want,

184
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,633
He'll find a way
to give it to him.

185
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,134
Okay.

186
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,136
Thanks, louis.

187
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,571
I'll take care of your stuff.

188
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,939
No, no.
You have enough on your mind.

189
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,608
I'll take care of it myself.

190
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,615
Mr. Specter,
don't tell me.

191
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,018
You're here to talk
about ms. Paulsen.

192
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
I'm here to tell you
you made your point.

193
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,755
(evan) and what point is that?

194
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,623
If you drop any charges
against donna,

195
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,991
We'll drop the lawsuit
against you.

196
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,127
Well, that's not
a very even trade.

197
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,764
I'm giving your client the
chance to get away with murder.

198
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,066
Last I checked, my client wasn't
being charged with murder,

199
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,801
And I don't need you
to drop your suit,

200
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,002
Because you have no case.

201
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,137
No case?

202
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,806
Your client put a faulty train
on those tracks,

203
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,042
People died, and they knew
it could happen the whole time.

204
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,109
And you have no proof.

205
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,611
And where I come from,

206
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,746
You cut a deal with me
to make sure I stop looking.

207
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,583
Then I guess we come
from different places,

208
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,785
Because I didn't give that video
to the district attorney

209
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,820
To leverage you into a deal.

210
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,723
I did it to blow you out
of the water.

211
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,025
This is a person's life.

212
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,027
Maybe you should have
thought of that

213
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,663
Before you sent her
to rob my client.

214
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,701
Evan, I care about this woman.

215
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,969
Look, I understand.

216
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,671
She's probably worked for you
for a long time.

217
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,206
Maybe you sleep together
once in a while.

218
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,775
But my job is to defend
my client

219
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,944
To the best of my abilities,

220
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,947
And that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

221
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,663
Holy shit.

222
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,766
You can't possible have
a check already.

223
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,770
I don't have a check, joe.

224
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,171
We have to drop the case.

225
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,740
What the hell are you
talking about?

226
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,774
We had drinks last night.

227
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,643
Yeah, we also had proof
last night,

228
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,777
And now we don't.

229
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,178
- Why not?
- It's complicated.

230
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,047
You know,
it's a lot of legal rigmarole...

231
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,917
But I'm also
not gonna stand here

232
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,184
And explain civil procedure.

233
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,086
Maybe I don't understand
civil procedure,

234
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,189
But I know enough to understand
when something doesn't add up.

235
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,225
We got the evidence
the wrong way.

236
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,760
Well, get it the right way.

237
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:22,727
Subpoena it or something.

238
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,995
I can't.

239
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,697
What do you mean, you can't?

240
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,032
That money was gonna
change my life.

241
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,800
And if you want to go to
a different law firm,

242
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,168
I understand.

243
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,104
You know as well as I do nobody
else is gonna take this case.

244
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,774
You told me you cared
about these people.

245
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,042
You gave me your word.

246
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,945
Yeah, and I wish I could
keep it.

247
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,080
I want those bastards
as much as you want this money,

248
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,181
But I've got no proof,

249
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,749
And you're not
a credible witness.

250
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,651
- Oh, that bullshit again.
- That's not bullshit.

251
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,653
If you had been straight with me
from day one,

252
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,188
We wouldn't even be in
this mess.

253
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,659
How much did they give you
to dump the case?

254
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,728
Had to be something.

255
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,730
Otherwise,
you wouldn't sell me out.

256
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,603
I'm sorry, joe.
It's over.

257
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,074
You're sorry?

258
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,914
[knocking]

259
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,917
Jessica.

260
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,919
Do you need something?

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,187
I came by earlier,
and you weren't in.

262
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,222
I had a meeting, and I
really didn't think you wanted

263
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,890
To be looped in on my schedule.

264
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,759
I don't,
and I'm not checking up on you.

265
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,195
I just didn't know if you
were coming in.

266
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,931
You mean you weren't sure
if I was ever coming in again.

267
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,166
You wouldn't be the first person
to leave a job

268
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,668
For personal reasons.

269
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,670
It sounds to me like you have
an agenda.

270
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,073
- I don't.
- Well, that's a first.

271
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,111
Are you saying that I came here
to push you out?

272
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm saying that I've never known
you not to know what you want.

273
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,682
What I want is to talk about us,

274
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,050
But you don't seem to want
to do that,

275
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:56,021
So I'm focusing on this.

276
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,789
I'm not resigning
my senior partnership

277
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,791
The day after
what happened happened,

278
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,192
If that's what you're asking.

279
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,829
I'm asking if you plan
to resign it at all.

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,132
And I can't tell you that
right now, because I don't know.

281
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,433
Well, when will you know?

282
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,769
Look, jessica,
you're the managing partner,

283
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,071
So if you want to push me out,
push me out,

284
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,073
But if you're asking me
what I want to do,

285
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,676
I'm telling you
that I haven't decided.

286
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,688
How did it go?

287
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,456
Never mind how it went.

288
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,425
Where's mike.
Did he file those papers?

289
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,060
I-I-I don't know.
He's not even in yet.

290
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,728
Well, you tell him
not to file anything,

291
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,697
And you tell him to do
whatever he has to

292
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,798
To stick it to that woman.

293
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,932
Why?

294
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,701
Because it didn't work.

295
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,036
What didn't work?

296
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,106
I tried to make a deal with evan
to trade the case.

297
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,775
You mean you offered to drop
the case in exchange for me.

298
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,943
Yes.

299
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,813
And now what are we gonna do?

300
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,980
(harvey)
you're not gonna do anything.

301
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,382
I'm gonna do whatever I have to

302
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,084
To get terrance wolf
to back off.

303
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,487
Harvey, there's no way the d.A.
Handles a case like this himself

304
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,022
Just because I work for you.

305
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,091
Whether he handles it himself
or not doesn't matter,

306
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,493
Because this case won't even
exist in another hour.

307
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,202
How did it go?

308
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,803
I just told a man
that everything

309
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,871
I promised him was bullshit.

310
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:20,939
How do you think it went?

311
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,073
Oh, mike, I'm sorry.

312
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,076
Oh, you should have seen
his face.

313
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,811
That money was gonna change
his life,

314
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,980
And then I dangled it in front
of him and ripped it away.

315
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,182
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

316
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,117
You did everything you could.

317
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,785
He accused me of selling out.

318
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,853
You know you didn't do that.

319
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,020
Didn't I?

320
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,022
We gave up because...

321
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,757
Of me?

322
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,927
That's not what I was gonna say.

323
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,995
Yeah, it was.

324
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,396
No, I was gonna say
because of harvey.

325
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,498
What are you talking about?

326
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,099
Harvey never wanted
to take this case,

327
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,534
So he put a clock on it
to get me to drop it.

328
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,202
That's why we're where we are
right now.

329
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,071
Listen to me;
harvey is out there right now

330
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,773
Busting his ass
to fix everything.

331
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,074
No, donna.

332
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,976
He doesn't give a shit about
this case, and he never did.

333
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,511
Then why did he send me here
to tell you to do

334
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,946
Everything you can to stick it
to evan smith?

335
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,948
She didn't take the deal,
did she?

336
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,984
No, she didn't.

337
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,085
(mike) donna, I'm sorry.

338
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,820
I didn't realize
that you were still...

339
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,021
On the hot seat?

340
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,091
Like I said, harvey's
busting his ass to fix it,

341
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,093
Which means he's gonna fix it.

342
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,563
Now, finish what we started
and figure out a way

343
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:22,033
To win this case.

344
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,908
Harvey specter.

345
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,476
I was wondering when you
would show up.

346
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,944
That's funny;
I was wondering why

347
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,245
You never sent me
a christmas card.

348
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,947
Ha-ha.

349
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,448
You don't seem
the least bit worried

350
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,918
About the pending charges
against your secretary.

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,886
I'm not,
because she did nothing wrong.

352
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,154
Well, you know what I think?

353
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,857
I think you wouldn't be here
if she did nothing wrong.

354
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,092
Listen to me.
She didn't steal anything.

355
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,829
She got those documents by
convincing them to let her in,

356
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,831
And that is not a crime.

357
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,498
And the last time
you were in my office,

358
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,534
You told me you hadn't committed
a crime to get the job done.

359
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,503
After I told you
you had an innocent man,

360
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,940
And all you cared about
was procedure.

361
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,975
All I cared about was the law.

362
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,477
Well, if you're so concerned
with people breaking the law,

363
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,279
Why don't you take a look
at those documents?

364
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,216
Because they prove liberty rail
actually committed a crime,

365
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,218
Unlike donna, whose only crime
is working for me.

366
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,253
I'm not investigating her
for working for you.

367
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,589
I'm investigating her
for felony fraud.

368
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,891
What the hell are you
talking about?

369
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,064
The woman that let her in
swears your secretary told her

370
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,067
She was with the national
transportation safety board.

371
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,236
That's a federal agency,

372
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,505
Which makes what she did
not a trick.

373
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,242
It makes it felony fraud.

374
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,648
My office.
Now.

375
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,153
Close the door.

376
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,155
Harvey, what happened?

377
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,556
What happened is,
you lied to me.

378
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,924
What are you talking about?

379
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,959
You told their secretary
you were with the ntsb?

380
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,962
- That's not what I said.
- Bullshit.

381
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,963
I know when I've been lied to.

382
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,098
Come clean right now.

383
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,499
I...

384
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,269
- Right the hell now.
- I never said I was with them.

385
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,570
I said, "have you ever heard of"

386
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,639
The national transportation
safety board?

387
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,107
How is that any different?

388
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,042
- I'm sorry, I...
- You're sorry?

389
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,278
Harvey, I swear I didn't know
that that made it a crime.

390
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,979
You knew when I point-blank
asked you,

391
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,547
And you lied to me about it.

392
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,117
Well, I thought that you
would take care of it.

393
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,552
How can I take care of it if you
don't tell me the goddamn truth?

394
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,588
Do you think that I didn't want
to tell you the truth?

395
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,257
- Then why didn't you?
- Because I was ashamed.

396
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,161
I know that it sounds stupid,

397
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,697
But you and mike and everyone
pull these rabbits

398
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,999
Out of your hats all the time,
and I just sit outside,

399
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,135
And I answer the phones.

400
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,638
And then I got those documents,
and people said I saved the day.

401
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,107
And the next thing I knew,
you were on my doorstep

402
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,109
Coming at me like I was
some sort of criminal,

403
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,480
And I panicked, and I lied.

404
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,983
- Donna...
- I'm sorry, harvey.

405
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,419
I know you are,
but this just got

406
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,587
1,000 times harder for me
to get out of.

407
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,156
[scoffs]

408
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,657
You mean for you
to get me out of.

409
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,293
Donna, you of all people
should understand by now

410
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,728
That to me
they're the same thing.

411
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,506
What are you doing here?

412
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,575
I went to see you at work.
They said you called in sick.

413
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,277
I said, what are you doing here?

414
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,512
I wanted to tell you
the good news.

415
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,114
I'm not dropping your case
after all.

416
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,049
Good for you.

417
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,085
Hey, joe.

418
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,553
I know you've been
jerked around,

419
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,055
But things are gonna change.

420
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,490
Gonna change?
Really?

421
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,259
I thought you said you got
the evidence in the wrong way.

422
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,562
Well, and you said we should
get it in the right way,

423
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,464
So that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

424
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,233
Like I said, good for you, but
you're not gonna do it with me.

425
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,035
Hey, joe.

426
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,005
I can't subpoena those records
without the legitimate client.

427
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,074
I have no basis and no standing
to move forward if I did.

428
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,544
Oh, now you have time to explain
procedure to me, right?

429
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,147
Okay, fine.
I deserved that.

430
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,150
But, joe, this case cannot
move forward without you.

431
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:03,121
You should have thought of that
before you cut me loose.

432
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,522
They got to you, didn't they?

433
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,092
They gave you a few dollars
to shut you up,

434
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,560
And then they sealed
the agreement

435
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,762
With no admission of guilt.

436
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,096
You know what?

437
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,232
I can't comment on that,
and you know why,

438
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,267
But let's get
one thing straight.

439
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,703
They didn't shut me up;
you did.

440
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,071
And if I took anything,

441
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,672
It was because I had
no other choice.

442
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,207
Joe, listen to me.

443
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,309
If the check hasn't cleared,
we can still get out of it.

444
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,811
Don't come by here anymore.

445
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,515
So much for really caring
about those people.

446
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,552
Go to hell.

447
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,529
I thought nobody puts baby
in the corner.

448
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,730
Since when am I "baby"?

449
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,365
Since you're sitting
in the corner.

450
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,267
You're usually a power table
kind of girl.

451
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,536
Well, I'm not tonight.

452
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,639
Jessica, what's going on?

453
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,840
[sighs]

454
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,476
It's over between me and jeff.

455
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,278
What?
What happened?

456
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,080
It's not important.

457
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,549
One day the man is calling me
about taking you to paris,

458
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,750
And the next it's over,

459
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,552
And the reason for all that
isn't important?

460
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,820
No, it isn't, because right now,

461
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,855
I have to decide whether
he should stay at the firm.

462
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,757
Well, then I'd say the reason
that you broke up is important.

463
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,425
And I don't want to get into it
right now,

464
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,360
Because it's not going
to change.

465
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,831
Wow, heard that before.

466
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,868
Leah, I'm not like dad,
and I'm tired of hearing it.

467
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,837
I know you always say
you're not like him,

468
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,506
But here you are scrubbing up
for the next surgery

469
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,475
Instead of fighting for the man
that you love.

470
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,543
You know what?

471
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,247
Most sisters would say,
"I'm sorry, jessica,"

472
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,482
And then give me a hug.

473
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,684
Jessica, I am sorry
that you're hurting,

474
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,319
And if you want something
sugarcoated,

475
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,422
I'll order you dessert, but that
is not how we show support.

476
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,691
You're right.

477
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:51,762
We show it by telling each other
what we think, so...

478
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,532
And what I think is,

479
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,468
Two days ago,
this man loved you.

480
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,804
So unless you cheated on him,
stole from him,

481
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,641
Or killed somebody,
it seems to me the two of you

482
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,810
Should be able to get past
whatever it is you did do.

483
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,520
Joe henderson backed out.

484
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,725
Harvey, did you hear me?

485
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,593
They paid him off.
We have no case anymore.

486
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,795
And right now,
I have a bigger problem.

487
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:25,797
Donna lied.

488
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,532
What do you mean, she lied?

489
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,334
I mean she didn't just bullshit
her way into that file room.

490
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,703
She used the words "national
transportation safety board."

491
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,338
In what context?

492
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,841
In the context of committing
a crime to help you.

493
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,577
Are you accusing me of knowing
that she did that?

494
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,712
If you didn't know, it's because
you didn't want to know.

495
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,447
Harvey, she told me
she didn't steal those things.

496
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,916
I believed her
the same way you did.

497
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,484
And you lied just like she did.

498
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,818
I did not lie.

499
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,621
Then how come when I asked you
where those documents came from,

500
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,356
You didn't say one word
about donna?

501
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,525
Because you wouldn't have
listened to another word

502
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,561
I said after that, and I was
trying to get the job done.

503
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,362
Well, you got the job done
by risking her.

504
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,665
And how is that different than
all the times you risked me?

505
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,533
Because she's different.

506
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:14,712
Harvey, I swear I didn't know.

507
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,415
Well, like I said, right now,
I've got a bigger problem.

508
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,784
Donna's gonna be charged
with felony fraud,

509
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,886
And she's guilty.

510
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,726
- Five elements.
- What?

511
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,628
Proving fraud consists
of five elements.

512
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,763
Okay, I'm aware of that,
and they have all of them.

513
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,565
What about injury?

514
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,867
How did donna injure
liberty rail?

515
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,570
- You know how.
- I know, and you know.

516
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,439
But evan smith isn't gonna sit
in front of a jury

517
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,574
And explain why
those documents have value

518
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,410
Without exposing her client
to criminal charges.

519
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,578
And without damages,

520
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,281
What donna did is trespassing
at the worst.

521
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,549
What do you want me to do?

522
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,883
I want you to stay
on the civil case.

523
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,385
Harvey, the lawsuit is dead.

524
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,620
We don't have a plaintiff.

525
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,455
Then get another one,
because I'm not letting

526
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:02,460
This woman get away
with a goddamn thing.

527
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,696
(wolf) all right,

528
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,365
I'm paying you the courtesy
of a meeting.

529
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,699
What's on your mind?

530
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,468
(evan) well, based on his
reputation, I would say that

531
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,370
He's going to try to weasel
his way out of this.

532
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,672
(harvey) what I'm going
to do is save mr. Wolf

533
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,607
From being embarrassed
in open court.

534
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,976
And I'm sure there's no side
benefit to you in the process.

535
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,612
On the stand, right?

536
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,581
So do you; that's why you
had her come down here.

537
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,750
And did she tell you
what donna actually took?

538
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:28,352
You told me what donna took.

539
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,622
And I also told you that it
proves they committed a crime,

540
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,359
But she can't say that,
which means all donna stole

541
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,861
Was a meaningless stack
of papers,

542
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,596
And without actual damages...

543
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,730
I know the law.

544
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,465
Then you know you've got
a shitty witness.

545
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,605
Well?

546
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,573
I can't get into the details
of those documents,

547
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,475
But that doesn't mean
that they don't have value.

548
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,477
Of course they have value.
The saved you ass.

549
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,813
They're confidential.
They have trade secrets.

550
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,581
The only secret that is in there

551
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,849
Is that your trains kill people.

552
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,718
(wolf) all right, enough.

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,690
Ms. Smith,
if you can't show damages,

554
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,358
I have no case.

555
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,459
You don't need damages.

556
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,560
You have intent.

557
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,529
And if you really knew
my reputation,

558
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,397
You'd also know
that I used to work here.

559
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,567
And I can tell you they've never
gone after anyone for intent

560
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,969
In the history
of the d.A.'s office,

561
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,670
And they're not gonna start now.

562
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,405
It was good doing business
with you, evan.

563
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,517
Hey.

564
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,586
Hey.
How are things?

565
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,421
You mean the things
that you said that harvey

566
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,522
Would take care of?

567
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,391
Yes, those are exactly
the things I mean.

568
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,826
Well,
those are exactly the things

569
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,728
That harvey just took care of.

570
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,762
He did?

571
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:49,900
He did.

572
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,636
[exhales]

573
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,473
Louis, what's wrong?

574
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,774
Nothing's wrong.

575
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,944
It's just...
I know it wasn't gonna happen,

576
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:04,915
But when you first told me
they might press charges,

577
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,451
The thought of you
behind bars...

578
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,554
Oh, come on.

579
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,557
It just would have been
some cushy, white-collar resort.

580
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,593
I could have finally gotten
my yoga certification...

581
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,729
It wouldn't have been.

582
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,664
But it doesn't matter,
because I was right.

583
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,733
Harvey did whatever it took.

584
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,771
Thanks, louis.

585
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,673
God, he doesn't even know
how lucky he is to have you.

586
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,743
Norma's still out, isn't she?

587
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,612
Her goddamn sister tripped
and fell in the tub,

588
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,880
And she went to help.

589
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,549
It's like she doesn't even care
about me at all.

590
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,519
[laughter]

591
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,593
[laughs]

592
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,996
[exhales]

593
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,132
But you do have access
to accounts payable,

594
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,567
So if you could...

595
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,837
Look... no... hey, please,
just hear me...

596
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,840
God damn it.

597
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,509
Another one wouldn't take
your call?

598
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,677
No, none of them will.

599
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,579
I've been through
this entire directory.

600
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,481
As soon as I use the words
"crash," "heat," or "sensors,"

601
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,549
They all stop talking.

602
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,683
Mike, people died.

603
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,618
Somebody's got to want to do
the right thing.

604
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,520
Well, if somebody does,
I can't find them.

605
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,988
Okay what about
the victims' families?

606
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,623
Oh, you mean
the original plaintiffs.

607
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,493
Yeah, the problem is,
they already have a settlement.

608
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,627
Go on.
Look at it.

609
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,862
They weren't stupid.

610
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,230
It prevents them from ever
going after them again.

611
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:29,700
Mike,
I'm just trying to help you.

612
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,935
I know you are.
I'm sorry.

613
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,736
I'm just frustrated.

614
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,206
If I can't find a new plaintiff,
I can't keep this case alive.

615
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,541
Wait a second.

616
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,678
You said no one at the company
will talk to you.

617
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,113
They won't, because they're all
afraid they'll lose their job.

618
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,783
All right, so what about someone
who has nothing left to lose?

619
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,920
What are you talking about?

620
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,823
I'm talking about him.

621
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,829
So I rescheduled the meeting
that you missed with latham

622
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,498
For 3:00 tomorrow.

623
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,665
Here are the newest contracts.

624
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,001
Also, kathy finn called
about the takeover,

625
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,770
So I sent her the latest specs,
and I told her to sit tight.

626
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,939
And I noticed the left pen on
your desk set was out of ink,

627
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,574
So I had the cartridge replaced.

628
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,810
You could have done all of this
while I was out of the office.

629
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,979
I know, but then I wouldn't have
had a chance to thank you.

630
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,680
Donna.

631
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,883
[sighs] thank you, harvey.

632
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,784
You're welcome.

633
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,521
(wolf)
ms. Paulsen, mr. Specter.

634
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,290
(harvey) terrance, you better be
here to give donna a formal apology

635
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,658
From the d.A.'s office.

636
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,293
[laughs] no.

637
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:32,129
I'm here to give
her lawyer this.

638
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,634
Harvey, what is that?

639
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:37,768
Donna, leave the room.

640
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,969
(wolf)
you can tell her to leave.

641
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,638
Don't forget to tell her
her arraignment's

642
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,705
At 9:00 a.M.
Tomorrow morning.

643
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,840
Arraignment?
For what?

644
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,842
You son of a bitch.

645
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,709
You amended the charges
to intent?

646
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,144
You said it's never been done

647
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,779
In the history
of the d.A.'s office.

648
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,314
I decided to make history.

649
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,750
By going after someone
for stealing nothing.

650
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,752
She went in there to find
the hope diamond.

651
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,921
Just because she came out
with a piece of glass

652
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,322
Doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.

653
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,757
That's exactly what it means.

654
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,625
Every time I run into you,

655
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,728
You tell me whatever shady thing
just went down

656
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,831
Was about the greater good
or that it didn't happen

657
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,302
Or this, that, or the other,
but a crime was committed here,

658
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,636
And I'm going after her for it.

659
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,638
Bullshit.
You're going after me.

660
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,941
Oh, you're telling me
you didn't order her to do it.

661
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,242
No, I didn't.

662
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,678
Well, we'll find out...

663
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,013
When she's about to be convicted

664
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:27,785
And I offer her a deal.

665
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,859
What happens now?

666
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,228
What happens now is,
we go in there tomorrow

667
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,798
And enter a plea of not guilty.

668
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,032
But I am guilty.

669
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,868
Donna, intent to commit fraud
is a bullshit charge,

670
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,737
And he's just using you
to try to scare you.

671
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,706
Well, it's working.
I'm scared.

672
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,608
- Donna...
- What's the punishment?

673
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,710
It doesn't matter, because
I'm gonna get you out of it.

674
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:55,012
Harvey, what's the punishment?

675
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,047
Three to five years.

676
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,149
Oh, my god.

677
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,185
- Three to five years for what?
- Not now, louis.

678
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,053
I just saw terrance wolf
at the elevator.

679
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,155
Three to five years for what?

680
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,058
He's charging her with intent
to commit fraud.

681
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Holy shit.

682
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,894
Louis, I don't want to hear it.

683
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,063
Get her out of this.

684
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,164
This isn't helping.

685
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,899
What the hell do you think
I've been doing?

686
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,669
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

687
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,904
I told her that you were never
gonna let her get in trouble.

688
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:21,872
It's not so simple.

689
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,040
What the hell isn't so simple?

690
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,042
She's guilty.

691
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,977
Wolf is trying to use her
to turn on me,

692
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,646
Because he thinks
I put her up to it.

693
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:29,913
Did you?

694
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,215
Harvey didn't even know
I did it.

695
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,716
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

696
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,652
- Because I'm taking over.
- No, you're not.

697
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,020
He's trying to get her
to turn on you.

698
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,421
You cannot be her lawyer.

699
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,790
She's not going to,
so what difference does it make?

700
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,693
The difference is, if you're out
of the picture, wolf backs down.

701
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,928
From where he's standing,
I'm in the picture,

702
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,230
And he's never gonna back down.

703
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,065
You don't know that,
and this is donna's life.

704
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,433
And I'm not putting it
in your hands.

705
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,934
And it's not your decision
to make.

706
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,870
No, it's not.
It's donna's.

707
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,772
And she's sticking with me.

708
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,680
Louis, please,
I know that you want to help,

709
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,747
But just go.

710
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,434
- Mr. Jaworski.
- Yeah.

711
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,703
My name is mike ross.
I'm with pearson specter litt.

712
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,904
This is rachel zane.

713
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,772
She's one of our associates.

714
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,808
Sir, we'd like to speak with you
about the accident.

715
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,444
Look, I was already deposed
for that lawsuit.

716
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:34,778
The victims got paid.

717
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,180
I said everything
I had to say, okay?

718
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,449
We're not here
to come after you.

719
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,983
We want you to sue liberty rail.

720
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,251
Oh, yeah?
And why would I sue them?

721
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,487
'Cause while you might have been
driving the train,

722
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:44,955
That accident wasn't your fault.

723
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,857
Is this some kind of a joke?

724
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,025
No, sir.
It isn't.

725
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,493
They made you the fall guy.

726
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,063
Bullshit.
Why would they do that?

727
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,832
Because they needed
to blame someone,

728
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,767
And not only were you
at the wheel,

729
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,168
You had no memory
of what happened.

730
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,971
Nah, I don't believe it.

731
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,006
They're a good company.
They wouldn't do this.

732
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,208
Mr. Jaworski...

733
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,476
Look, I killed those people.

734
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,178
And they still gave me
early retirement

735
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,513
And let me keep my pension.

736
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,815
The reason they did that
was to keep you quiet.

737
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,187
I need you to get off
my property,

738
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,956
Both of you.

739
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,993
Sir, you know that we're telling
the truth.

740
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,962
Yeah, well, is the truth
gonna support the family

741
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,097
Of a guy who can't get another
job for the rest of his life?

742
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,932
If we win,
you'll be set up for life.

743
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,067
Ah, take a look at me.

744
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,236
I ain't the guy who wins.

745
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,271
I'm the guy who loses.

746
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,940
What if I can guarantee
to take care of all of that

747
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,208
No matter what happens.

748
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,782
What would you need me to do?

749
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,884
(man) all rise.

750
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,856
You okay?

751
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,958
Mm-hmm.

752
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,226
Am I gonna have to talk?

753
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,828
Just be polite
and say "your honor."

754
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,863
It will be over
before you know it.

755
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,032
(man)
state versus donna paulsen.

756
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,803
Is the defense counsel prepared
to proceed with the arraignment?

757
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,805
We are, your honor.

758
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,205
Ms. Paulsen,
you have been charged

759
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,240
With felony intent
to commit fraud.

760
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,277
This carries a maximum sentence
of up to five years in prison.

761
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,479
Do you understand the charges
against you today?

762
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,980
Yes, your honor.

763
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,048
How do you plead?

764
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,084
Not guilty, your honor.

765
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,219
(man) very well.

766
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,488
Mr. Wolf, is the state ready
to go to trial?

767
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,490
We are, your honor.

768
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,224
Trial is set to begin Monday.

769
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,059
Next case.

770
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,828
(harvey)
all right, you made your point.

771
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,229
Let's plead this down
to a misdemeanor

772
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,964
And both go back
to our real jobs.

773
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,833
This is my real job.

774
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,467
[faintly] maybe if you had
a little more respect

775
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,470
For what it stands for,
you wouldn't be standing here.

776
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:43,574
[faintly] listen, I'm gonna wipe
that look off your smug face.

777
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,142
You give it a try, harvey,

778
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,177
But I've got all the evidence
I need.

779
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,588
You're gonna have to go
find yourself a new secretary.

780
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,905
[exhales]

781
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,044
I see you're back
to not knocking.

782
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,180
I take it that means
you've made up your mind.

783
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,915
I have.

784
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:25,917
And?

785
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,518
And what I've decided

786
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,021
Is that you shut the door
on me the other night,

787
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:34,925
And it's not fair you to dictate
what I do and don't get to say.

788
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,627
I told you.

789
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,262
It doesn't matter
what you have to say,

790
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,163
Because whatever it is,
I won't believe it.

791
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:45,035
Well, what if I was here
to tell you that I love you?

792
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:54,244
Jessica,
you lied to me for months...

793
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,513
Jeff, please.

794
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,950
Just listen.

795
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,119
I know I hurt you,

796
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,621
But you were the one

797
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:08,258
Who wanted us to work together
and be in a relationship.

798
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,928
And you were the one who thought
it was a mistake.

799
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,963
Because I was scared.

800
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,632
But I changed my mind,

801
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:19,636
Because you refused to give up.

802
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,106
And now I'm refusing to give up.

803
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,043
I want you to stay here.

804
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,578
I want us to have both.

805
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,515
[light piano music]

806
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:32,517
Jessica...

807
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:37,120
You wanted me to let
my walls down.

808
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,723
Well, they're down.

809
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,551
(harvey)
donna, why don't you go home?

810
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,053
You know I like to be alone when
I'm getting ready for a trial.

811
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,089
I need to talk to you.

812
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,156
What is it?

813
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,525
I think maybe louis was right.

814
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,528
You think louis was right
about what?

815
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,197
Maybe he should be
handling my case.

816
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,237
Okay, well,
if that's how you feel.

817
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,306
I knew it; I knew you would
take this as an insult.

818
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,141
How exactly would you like me
to take it?

819
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,509
I would like you
to take it seriously

820
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,011
And talk about it with me.

821
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,647
Okay, donna, why exactly would
you prefer louis to handle this?

822
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,649
Because I sat
in that arraignment today,

823
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,518
And it hit me for the first time

824
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,122
That I might actually go
to prison.

825
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,524
And you were more concerned
with attacking terrance wolf

826
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,658
Than you were with me.

827
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,793
So you think louis is right.

828
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,495
I piss off the d.A. Too much.

829
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,630
- Well, you sure did today.
- Because he's coming at us.

830
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,232
And you're pouring gas
on the fire.

831
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,200
Because that's what I do,
and I don't need you

832
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,703
Coming in here second-guessing
how I do my job.

833
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,671
Harvey,
why are you attacking me?

834
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:02,673
I'm not the enemy.

835
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:03,807
You sure as hell are right now.

836
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,275
What?
Why am I the...

837
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,777
(harvey) because I'm
getting ready for a fight,

838
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,379
(donna)
I'm not telling you that.

839
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,814
I'm telling you
that I'm petrified.

840
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,550
(harvey) and I understand, but I
don't have time to comfort you.

841
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,685
- Well, I need you to make time.
- And I can't, because...

842
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,055
Harvey, this is my life!

843
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,760
When I told louis how you
got me out of this thing,

844
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,096
He told me how scared he was
at the thought

845
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:30,667
Of me going to prison,
and I just... Need...

846
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,837
You... To...

847
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,807
Donna, the thought of you
going to prison

848
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,176
Makes me want to drop
to my knees.

849
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,544
You want to hear me say it?

850
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:42,279
There it is.

851
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,547
But that's not gonna happen,

852
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,148
Because I'm not gonna
let it happen.

853
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:49,152
But in order to do that,
you need to let me do what I do.

854
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,687
- Harvey...
- That's enough.

855
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,255
You want someone
to give you a hug?

856
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,523
Go to louis.

857
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,325
You want someone to get you out
of this thing,

858
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,593
You need to leave me alone.

859
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,174
I need to know everything
you have,

860
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,642
And I need to know right now.

861
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:16,246
What does that give us?

862
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,881
What do you mean?
It gives us standing.

863
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,549
Now we can subpoena
those records.

864
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,750
Well, that's not enough.

865
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,285
- It's a start.
- I don't need a start.

866
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,653
I need a finish,
and I need it now.

867
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,558
They're charging donna,
aren't they?

868
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,327
She was arraigned this morning.

869
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,830
If this thing goes to trial,
I can't guarantee a win.

870
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,565
So we're back to trading
the case for donna.

871
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,234
Yeah, and I don't want to hear
your moral objections

872
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,236
About those people getting away
with murder.

873
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,304
But if donna was arraigned,

874
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,839
It's not up to them
to drop the charges.

875
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,908
It's up to wolf, and you know
he's never gonna do that.

876
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,710
I'm not talking about
dropping the charges.

877
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,845
I'm talking about making
this whole damn thing go away.

878
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,914
Harvey, if you're saying
what I think you're saying,

879
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,516
That's obstruction of justice.

880
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:53,917
The way I see it, it's justice.

881
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,919
You know what I mean.

882
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,286
I do, and I don't give a shit.

883
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,255
- This is donna.
- All right, I get it.

884
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,890
But what if what I have
isn't enough?

885
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,258
Like you said, it's a start.

886
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,727
Have an official complaint
on my desk by the morning.

887
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,896
- And what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get us enough.

888
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,843
(joe) all right, I hear you.
I hear you.

889
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,314
Do you know who I am?

890
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,316
No.

891
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,551
Yeah, mike ross works for me.

892
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:28,852
Hey, I don't give a shit.

893
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,887
I told him not to take your case
in the first place,

894
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,557
Because I knew you were
a goddamn shakedown artist,

895
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,292
But now someone I care about
is in trouble,

896
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,560
Because you took a payout.

897
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,861
Get out of my face.

898
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,229
Listen to me.

899
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:42,532
If you don't do
what we need you to do,

900
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,534
I will hurt you.

901
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,968
You better be prepared
to kill me,

902
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,937
Because I'm not gonna give
that money back.

903
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,906
Well, if this is just
about money,

904
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:53,577
Then we don't need to fight
at all.

905
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,814
Harvey,
this is becoming a habit.

906
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,749
I've seen you more than
my last three boyfriends.

907
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,785
Somehow that doesn't
surprise me.

908
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,553
[laughs] you're funny.

909
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,955
I like you.

910
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:07,557
But I know you're not here
to mock my relationship,

911
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,825
So what's on your mind?

912
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:09,960
We wanted to give you this.

913
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,695
(evan) what's this?

914
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:14,297
(mike) it's the lawsuit we filed
on behalf of michael jaworski.

915
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,900
You know, the man you let
take the fall for the accident.

916
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,235
Michael jaworski can't sue...

917
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,703
(harvey) what?

918
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,539
To take care of his expenses?

919
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,574
Well, now I'm taking care
of his expenses.

920
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,775
And now we have standing,

921
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,911
And we are going to subpoena
those documents.

922
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,580
Am I supposed to start quaking
in my boots?

923
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,983
(harvey) nope, we know if
you can doctor a report,

924
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:34,718
You can alter
those maintenance records.

925
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,852
I didn't alter anything.

926
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,721
Well, that's not what
joe henderson said.

927
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,723
He said you came to him,
admitted everything,

928
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,758
And offered him a settlement
to keep quiet.

929
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,661
We didn't admit anything,
and that settlement is sealed.

930
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:47,297
Oh, you mean this settlement?

931
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,700
We had an agreement.

932
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,303
(harvey) well, here's the thing
about paying people off, evan.

933
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,338
Someone can always
pay them more.

934
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,806
[exhales]

935
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,609
His word won't hold up
against richard mcintyre's.

936
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,579
Oh, he's not saying that richard
mcintyre put him up to it.

937
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,581
He's saying you did.

938
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,948
That's bullshit.

939
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,616
And does that really matter?

940
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,953
What do you want?

941
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,022
You made the author
of that report disappear.

942
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,724
You made joe henderson
disappear.

the witness against donna

Change her tune.

945

That's obstruction of justice.

That's not my problem.

You son of a bitch.

It's your call.

Maybe people will believe joe,
maybe they won't,

But instead of making money,

951
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,907
You're gonna be
defending yourself in court

For the next five years.

You're so sure we did this,
you're really gonna let us

Get away with murder
for your secretary?

(harvey) you're damn right I am,
and if I had to do it again,

- Jeff...
- Jessica, you were right.

We either need to have both,
or it's not going to work.

And you don't want both?

'cause you made me
burst out laughing.

You didn't just burst.

972
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,031
You spat a piece of shrimp
across the room

And into the back
of my mother's hair.

because of all the hair spray,

And it stuck in there

Oh, my god.

He was such a loser.

No, I thanked you for fixing it.

Now I'm thanking you for not
bringing it up all night.

I just figured if you wanted
it brought up,

990
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:44,007
You'd bring it up,
and now you have, so...
